The courtyard of the Jasmine Pavilion had originally been filled with jasmine flowers, but many had withered over the years. This time, they were replanted as part of the restoration. [Li Xiaolü][y156] also designed the landscape, creating a Suzhou-style garden with enclosing walls, latticed windows, a rockery, and a pond. In the end, the newly restored Jasmine Pavilion took on the style of many of the fake ancient buildings from their original time.

Wang Ci was dumbfounded. The concept of private gardens had never existed in Lingao. Apart from the modest rock and water decorations in the backyard of the county yamen, the Jasmine Pavilion was the finest man-made landscape in the county, often serving as a venue for elegant gatherings and banquets for local officials and literati.

The short duration of the construction also seemed unimaginable to Wang Ci. He hadn't seen the short-haired bandits use any special mechanical assistance, nor did they employ an overwhelming number of workers. By his estimation, if he had organized the repairs himself, it would have taken at least half a month, not to mention the fact that the Australians had also expanded the site with many new buildings.

In addition to the original structures, the construction team added several new buildings, including a two-story waterside pavilion for gatherings and banquets, modern-style classrooms and dormitories, as well as toilets and bathhouses.

Seeing the many new rooms, Wang Ci couldn't help but find Xiong Buyou, who was coordinating on-site, to inquire about their purpose.

"Of course they have a purpose," Xiong Buyou said with a smile. "The Jasmine Pavilion used to be an academy, didn't it?"

The Jasmine Pavilion had been an academy during the Song dynasty, experiencing periods of prosperity and decline. It had also served as an academy for a long time during the Ming dynasty, but by the time Wang Ci arrived in Lingao, the academy existed in name only. The reason was simple—no money.

If even the county school lacked funds, a private academy like the Jasmine Pavilion, which relied on public donations, was even worse off. It had once owned over a hundred *mu* of land as a source of funding, but over the years, the land had been gradually sold off or seized by powerful landlords, becoming a muddled account. Without funds, they couldn't afford to hire good teachers or provide stipends, and naturally, the students disappeared.

"Does Chief Xiong mean to restore the Jasmine Pavilion Academy?" Wang Ci asked, his voice filled with excitement.

"Of course. Otherwise, what's the point of repairing it? Just for drinking?"

"This is a truly great kindness!" Wang Ci bowed deeply in his excitement. "On behalf of the scholars of Lingao, I offer my gratitude..."

"Alright, alright, there's no need for empty formalities." Xiong Buyou thought to himself, *Don't be in such a hurry to represent anyone. You don't even know that this thing is actually a sugar-coated bullet. It tastes sweet now, but you'll find out what's inside later.*

After the reconstruction of the Jasmine Pavilion was completed, Lingao County held a "warm," "simple," and "harmonious" ribbon-cutting ceremony. Wu Mingjin had been reluctant to appear at a髡-thief event, but the restoration of the Jasmine Pavilion was a major event for the county, a great deed that promoted culture and education. His absence would make him seem "out of touch with the people." So, he had to show up.

Wang Ci was once again used by the Crossing Group. He tirelessly ran around, delivering invitations to the Jasmine Pavilion's ribbon-cutting ceremony to all the gentry and scholars in the county. The Executive Committee estimated that given the fame and significance of the Jasmine Pavilion locally, these people were unlikely to refuse.

As expected, not only did all the county's *juren* and *xiucai* declare it a grand event they must attend, but even Liu Dalin, whose attendance the Executive Committee had been uncertain about, stated that it was a great event for the education of the entire county and he absolutely had to come. Not only that, but Wang Ci also managed to get the esteemed Jinshi Liu to write an inscription for the restored Jasmine Pavilion.

Although Liu Dalin still had some reservations about the Crossing Group, he had witnessed their actions over the past year—suppressing bandits, building roads, providing relief to the people, and settling the poor. Though he remained behind closed doors, his family was constantly gathering news from outside.

He was a local *jinshi*, famous throughout the county and even the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture. He knew he was a target for these australian bandits. So, for these past months, he had stayed at home, engrossed in his books, not only avoiding going out but also seeing few guests. Only his closest relatives and friends were granted an audience. He kept poison and a knife by his side, ready to take his own life at any moment. This was partly to avoid being captured and humiliated—he had advised on the attack against the short-haired bandits and heard that many of them had been killed, so he couldn't be sure they wouldn't seek revenge. It was also to prevent them from forcing him to take up a puppet post, in which case he could die to prove his innocence. The first time the short-haired bandits entered the city, the atmosphere in Liu Dalin's household was extremely tense. Not just him, but his entire family and servants were prepared to die together.

Unexpectedly, the short-haired bandits retreated after entering the city, merely delivering a few dozen pirate heads to the county. In the following months, apart from a group of them wandering into the city during the New Year, no large contingent of their forces entered the city again. As for Liu Dalin's family, they were completely ignored—it was as if the short-haired bandits didn't even know a person like Liu Dalin existed in Lingao.

The *jinshi* had imagined countless times how the short-haired bandits would storm his residence, holding a knife to his throat, and how he would stand unyielding, either dying while cursing the rebels or taking poison... But none of the scenes he had imagined came to pass. No one came seeking revenge, nor did anyone try to coerce or entice him into taking a puppet post. While relieved, he also felt a sense of disappointment—these bandits were truly clueless.

His family, unaware of his thoughts, breathed a sigh of relief that the short-haired bandits were not bothering them. When they relayed the news from outside, Liu Dalin, though he never commented, was secretly astonished. What were these overseas Australians, who claimed to be descendants of the Song, really after in Lingao?

The Australians suppressed bandits, built roads, opened workshops, and constructed waterworks in Lingao—not a single one of these actions was not beneficial to the country and the people. They had traveled thousands of miles from their homeland to this remote southern county of the Great Ming to do all this. In this era, there was no concept of "the spirit of Lei Feng." Liu Dalin couldn't see what practical benefits they could gain from "learning from Lei Feng" in Lingao.

With his political wisdom, Liu Dalin naturally understood that this was a move to win the hearts of the people. But it seemed pointless to win hearts in Lingao—the place was so remote and barren. Even if the Australians could make the entire county rebel, what then? Even if they were more capable and could occupy the entire island of Hainan, it would still be just a corner of the South China Sea.

When Wang Ci came to deliver the invitation, his family strongly advised Liu Dalin not to appear and to keep a low profile. Although it was a good thing, if the government forces ever retook Lingao, it would be hard to explain. But Liu Dalin saw it differently.

In his view, regardless of the Australians' motives, their repair of the Confucian temple, restoration of the Jasmine Pavilion, and funding for the reopening of the Jasmine Pavilion Academy were all great deeds for the local community. As the one and only *jinshi* from Lingao, his absence from such an occasion would disappoint the scholars. Besides, by always hiding at home, he could never grasp the Australians' intentions. It was better to be more open, to go out and see for himself. Seeing is believing. Finally, since the Australians hadn't sought revenge or forced him into a "puppet post" for over a year, it was unlikely they would do so now. Moreover, the Australians had never raised a banner of rebellion or driven out Wu Mingjin—Lingao was still a county of the Great Ming.

Liu Dalin's acceptance of the invitation and his writing of the inscription caused a great stir among the scholars and gentry of Lingao. For a time, the news of the Australians repairing the county school and Confucian temple and rebuilding the Jasmine Pavilion was the talk of the town. Even the scholars who had been critical of their actions had to admit that the Australians were "devoted to the cause of education."

To reduce the resistance of the local scholars and gentry, Xiong Buyou, despite holding a modern ribbon-cutting ceremony, deliberately minimized the display of the transmigrators' power. Only he and a few others were present, and they carried no obvious weapons. The atmosphere was one of harmony.

The ceremony was a blend of ancient and modern. After speeches from the leaders of both sides, Wu Ya personally unveiled the stone tablet inscribed with "Record of the Chongzhen Era Restoration of the Jasmine Pavilion," written by Liu Dalin. As the red silk cloth fell away, Xiong Buyou and the few transmigrators behind him spontaneously applauded, and surprisingly, the surrounding natives followed suit.

Wu Mingjin elegantly cut the silk ribbon with a pair of silver scissors—this was the only part of the ceremony that caused discussion among the scholars, who thought it was too wasteful. The scissors, made of more than two *liang* of silver, became a gift for the ribbon-cutter.

After the ribbon-cutting, the crowd toured the newly renovated Jasmine Pavilion, marveling at the new facilities and furniture. Those who had more dealings with the Crossing Group knew that the several newly built studies were actually modeled after the Australian schools.

What made the scholars most envious was the addition of a library in the Jasmine Pavilion. It was already stocked with hundreds of exquisitely printed books from the newly established printing factory of the Ministry of Light Industry. From the Hundred Schools of Thought to the Classics, Histories, Masters, and Collections, a wide range of representative works had been selected. The source texts were mostly from the collated editions of the Zhonghua Book Company and the electronic versions from Taiwan's Academia Sinica. The quality of the editions was first-rate for the Ming dynasty. The scholars eagerly vied to read them.

Flipping through these books with their incredibly clear characters, snow-white paper, and fine binding, the crowd couldn't help but marvel. A debate even broke out between the "pro-punctuation" and "anti-punctuation" factions: the former argued that punctuation was a good thing, while the latter believed it would damage the understanding of the original text.

But regardless of the punctuation debate, Lingao had never had such a well-stocked library, public or private. The impact on the scholars was immense. Weren't the Australians from a "barbarian land"? Why were their books so exquisitely printed? And the proofreading of each book was clearly done with great effort, something no barbarian land could achieve. Could it be that they were truly descendants of the Song, the legitimate heirs of Huaxia? The distinction between civilized and barbarian began to waver in the hearts of many scholars.
