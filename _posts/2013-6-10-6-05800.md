[Ma Qianzhu][y005] asked, "How much information do we have on Hale?"

"According to Lando, Hale was temporarily hired by Paul to help. Lando believes he has been involved in the arms trade, worked as a mercenary or a terrorist," Xu Ke replied. "It is said that this person is very unfriendly."

"I'm done with my questions. Please continue," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said.

"According to the confessions of the prisoners, when Mr. Paul first arrived, he proposed to cooperate with the Zheng family and set up an arms factory on Gulangyu. For this purpose, he showed the Zheng family several firearm samples. The demonstration was secret, and the prisoners did not know what the leaders of the Zheng family saw. But after this demonstration, the Zheng family's attitude towards him changed dramatically. It was probably some kind of subversive weapon."

"I have a question," Qian Shuiting raised a doubt. "Just now, the PPT showed several pieces of equipment that surpassed the average level of this time and space. I find this rather incredible. You have to know that we were able to build such a large-scale industry with preparations in both manpower and materials. If Hale is an individual, how could he have such great ability?"

"I have consulted several senators from the Manufacturing General Supervision Department on this issue, and their reply is as follows," Xu Ke took out a document and read, "Just from the photos of the items and buildings currently submitted to us for research, the technical content contained is somewhat superior to that of the 17th century, but the overall application level is very rough. The materials and craftsmanship used in the construction of these items did not exceed the level of the 1630s."

"Do you mean that Hale's technology is relatively crude?"

"Yes, the senators from the Manufacturing General Supervision Department do mean that," Xu Ke said. "I asked them to evaluate whether a single person could achieve these things, and the answer they gave was: yes. The premise is that there is enough manpower and material resources to be driven. Please allow me to continue reading some of the paragraphs:"

"In terms of technical level alone, the technical details required to realize windmills and reverberatory furnaces are not complicated, but with the craftsmanship and material level of this time and space, it is bound to require more manpower and material resources."

"So, Mr. Hale himself is an engineering and technical expert?" Qian Shuiting found it somewhat incredible. For a "redneck" like him, he was already a very capable person in the United States, but it was still possible for his brother and him to build a Kentucky rifle with modern equipment, but it was obviously beyond their ability to build a reverberatory furnace.

"It's very likely," Xu Ke nodded. "Although we have not yet been able to capture a product that reflects his true technical level. From the materials we have, the things he can produce with organized manpower and material resources should be far inferior to the products manufactured under our industrial system, but they should have exceeded the technical level that should exist in this time and space."

"Figuratively speaking, he can make a useful flintlock, but he can't make a Minié rifle, is that what you mean?"

"Regarding this issue, the senators from the industrial department said this, please allow me to read another relevant document," Xu Ke read, "In terms of manufacturing individual weapons, tools, or equipment alone, we believe that this transmigrator, with unlimited investment, may be able to manufacture a Minié rifle, but he does not have the ability to mass-produce it. The safety and durability of this Minié rifle will also have major problems..."

"Based on the above analysis, we can draw a conclusion that Hale did not die in the storm. On the contrary, he survived and transformed into a Japanese Christian, Mr. Paul, and is now opposing us."

There was a moment of silence in the meeting room. [Wen Desi][y002] asked, "Where is Hale now?"

"We were unable to obtain direct intelligence from the Zheng family, so it is currently unknown," Xu Ke said, glancing at Jiang Shan. Jiang Shan nodded slightly. "But we have a conjecture."

"Go on."

Xu Ke paused and took a sip of tea.

"Not long ago, during our hunger operation against the Manila galleons, we found some rather unconventional situations. The Spanish were purchasing large quantities of certain goods in the Americas that they had not purchased or rarely purchased in the past. Combined with the signs that the Spanish were recruiting a large number of Chinese craftsmen through Macau, we believe that Manila is very likely doing the same thing as the Zheng clan."

"You mean, the Spanish are improving their armaments?" asked He Ming, the director of military affairs.

Jiang Shan replied, "We don't have accurate intelligence on this yet, but based on the current situation, this possibility is very high."

"Do we have anyone in Manila?" Qian Shuiting asked.

"Lando is on his way to Manila and will be there soon," Jiang Shan replied.

"Why was he sent?" Qian Shuiting asked.

"After the hunger operation ended, we discovered the abnormality of the goods on the ship. We sent him to investigate the situation and hope to establish an intelligence network in Manila. Senator Lando has some understanding of the situation in Manila, and he is a European. The Spanish have strict control over the Chinese, so we don't have many choices." Qian Shuiting did not ask any further.

At this time, Zhao Manxiong asked, "That is to say, even if Lando didn't apply, we could only send him?"

"Yes, he is the most suitable candidate."

"This is a major threat to the Senate. Obviously, something is happening there that is not recorded in history. The Spanish are improving their weapons. We don't know what they want to do, and this is very dangerous. We need to figure it out and discuss a countermeasure as soon as possible," [Wen Desi][y002] concluded.

"We can only wait for Lando's first report."

"But if Xu Ke's deduction is correct, then Lando's situation is quite dangerous. Hale and Lando know each other. All the disguises we have made for Lando will be exposed. Therefore, I am prepared to suspend the Manila operation and withdraw Lando. We will make further plans after we have further investigated the situation."

"Further investigation? How can we investigate without sending someone? This is not the 21st century, where there are other reconnaissance methods. Here, there is no other way than to send intelligence agents."

Jiang Shan objected, "But this will put Lando in great danger. After all, Hale knows him. A transmigrated arms dealer has suddenly become some Count of Fannanuohua, driving a modern-style yacht. Hale can't be a fool. He knows what this means. He will kill Lando and then hide even deeper. It will be difficult to find him again."

"Then let Lando be more low-key and not be some count. He's not 007."

"The European circle in Manila is very small. A newcomer will attract attention no matter what," Jiang Shan said, displaying the professional expertise of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

Chen Haiyang spoke for the first time, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger's cub? There are dangers in war, and there will also be dangers in intelligence work. You can't just not do it because there are dangers."

"But this is no longer a danger, it's simply sending him to his death."

"How can that be? Didn't you say that whether Hale is alive and whether he is in Manila are just speculations? Maybe the facts are not like this. Or maybe he is not in Manila," Chen Haiyang said.

"But if Hale is there, then we are sending Lando to his death. The discovery in Xiamen this time is very important, and I understand your concerns. But this is not a reason to take unnecessary risks. Once Lando is exposed, we will not have a chance to rescue him. We can train a group of Filipino native intelligence agents. They will be better able to collect local intelligence. There are many difficulties, but there will always be a way. Every senator is our precious wealth..." Jiang Shan concluded in a passionate tone.

"Lando and Hale came on the same boat, right?" Zhao Manxiong suddenly spoke up.

The conference room suddenly fell silent, and the temperature seemed to drop a few degrees.

"After seeing the strength of the Senate, I don't believe Lando would make such a foolish choice," Jiang Shan said.

[Wen Desi][y002] said, "Then let him fully prove his loyalty."

"I repeat: this is a very dangerous operation, and Lando is very likely to die as a result."

"So, Director Jiang, your opinion is still to suspend the operation?"

"Yes, suspend the operation for now. After we have more intelligence, we will make the next decision. Otherwise, we may alert the enemy," Jiang Shan insisted on his proposal.

Zhao Manxiong coughed lightly, "Gentlemen, it is meaningless for us to get entangled in this issue here. Lando has been gone for many days. He is traveling on an ordinary merchant ship without a radio. Even if we cancel the operation, we cannot notify him. Even if we send a messenger on the 901 to chase him, it will be difficult to catch up with him."

"Secondly, Lando's situation has its particularity. It is not an unreasonable option for the Senate to conduct some tests on him. Now that we have a Hale in Manila who is giving us a headache, we should focus on the main point first. I believe that Lando's operation should continue, but we should make proper preparations. As the saying goes, don't put all your eggs in one basket. For this reason, it is necessary to prepare a B plan. Send a second group of personnel to Manila to support him, to ensure that Lando's operation can succeed, or to rescue him in case of failure."

Everyone nodded in agreement. Zhao Manxiong continued, "I suggest that the Foreign Intelligence Bureau continue to be responsible for this work. They can request the Executive Committee to mobilize the forces of the Special Reconnaissance Team and the Navy to support them."

"I have no objection," [Wen Desi][y002] said. "Does anyone else have any different opinions?"

Jiang Shan asked, "What if Lando is really a traitor?"

[Wen Desi][y002] was silent for a moment, "If Lando betrays us, we should bring him to the special court of the Senate for trial in accordance with the law."

The participants felt that although this plan was not perfect, it at least took into account all aspects. No one raised any objections.

[Wen Desi][y002] finally said, "No matter what is discovered in Manila, Hale and everything he brings must be purified."
