"No problem. Leave it to me," Qian Duoduo said nonchalantly. "We're rehearsing today as well. The ACE of our idol group, the 'Four Seasons Troupe,' is making her debut, so we need a sensational effect. Entering through the staff entrance is just too mundane. Arriving by boat—now that's style! I've already spoken with Auntie Panpan. The newspaper will be there to take your picture at the stadium's dock."

"That's... that's not a good idea," Zhang Yunmi said shyly. "It's a bit much."

"Not at all! You're going to be a big star. You need to have some self-awareness," Qian Duoduo said, abandoning her wind observation to explain her "plan" for the five-hundredth time. "...On the day of the performance, you'll arrive at the stadium dock on the *Cang*. You'll disembark and walk the route to the stadium entrance. The other girls from the Four Seasons Troupe will be waiting for you at the bottom of the steps. There will be a crowd of spectators on both sides of the street, and reporters taking pictures..."

"Isn't that like walking the red carpet?" Lin Ziqi interjected.

"Exactly! That's the feeling we're going for," Qian Duoduo said. "We don't have a red carpet, so we'll make do. The point is, the atmosphere has to be grand, it has to be enthusiastic..."

As she spoke, Sonia suddenly said, "There's someone waving at us up ahead."

Qian Duoduo walked to the bow. On a wooden platform by the riverbank, a young girl lay soaking wet, while another, dressed in a Fangcaodi student uniform, stood on the dock, waving frantically at their boat.

"What's going on?" Lin Ziqi asked.

"Looks like someone fell in. They're calling for help," Qian Duoduo said, raising her binoculars. "They look like naturalized citizens. Probably on their way to the stadium to watch the rehearsal."

"What should we do? Should we approach?" Zhong Xiaoying was at the helm.

Qian Duoduo cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted, "Hey! What's wrong?"

"Drowning!" the female student shouted back. "It's my friend! Help us!"

"Alright! Wait there, we're coming!"

"Let's go closer," Qian Duoduo said. "We can't just leave them to die. My mom taught me first aid for drowning. Besides, we're in the middle of nowhere. It's only a few kilometers to the East Gate Market. We can drop them off with the water patrol police—they have boats on standby. It's a win-win, and it won't delay us. Xiaoying, turn the rudder. Sonia, lower the sail!"

"Aye, aye." Zhong Xiaoying lightly turned the helm, and the *Cang* veered towards the platform.

The boat was fast, and in moments, they were close. Just as they were about to dock, the "drowning victim" leaped to her feet. Several men and women, armed with swords and knives, burst from the bushes and lunged towards the *Cang*.

Qian Duoduo screamed, "Xiaoying, turn the rudder, quick!" She drew the .357 revolver from her quick-draw holster and fired twice.

*Bang, bang!* Two crimson blossoms bloomed on the assassin's chest. His body went limp, and he collapsed onto the platform. Qian Duoduo took a step back, increasing the distance. Just then, *thwack, thwack, thwack!* Three throwing darts embedded themselves in the deck and mast.

"Everyone get down!" Qian Duoduo shouted, swiveling her gun. Another double tap, and another assassin screamed, his body twisting as he fell into the river. A pool of blood instantly stained the water's surface.

Zhong Xiaoying reacted quickly, reversing the rudder. The *Cang*'s bow swung away, turning towards the center of the river. Before they could pull clear, the last assassin had jumped onto the deck, shouting, "Die, Aussie scoundrel!"

The word "die" had barely left his lips when Qian Duoduo fired two more shots. The assassin staggered and tumbled into the Wenlan River.

"Quick, drop the sail!" Qian Duoduo shouted, rolling back into the cabin. It had all happened so fast that Lin Ziqi and the others had barely had time to react. The *Cang* was already drifting away, heading for the center of the river.

"Xiaoying, hold the rudder steady!" Qian Duoduo panted, her hands trembling. She fumbled in her pocket for the speedloader, which clattered onto the deck.

Zhong Xiaoying was slumped at the helm, her face pale, but her hands were still on the wheel. Hearing Qian Duoduo's command, she quickly righted the helm. Sonia and Lin Ziqi, coming to their senses, scrambled to raise the sail.

Qian Duoduo reloaded, stood, and fired several shots at the fleeing "female student" and "drowning victim." The "student" staggered and fell. The "victim," however, took the opportunity to escape into the brush.

"Quick, call Uncle Dongmen," Qian Duoduo said, holstering her pistol. "There are enemies!"

In the response headquarters, Mu Min, having just received the report by phone, was sweating profusely. The situation was critical. The enemy had attacked an Elder's boat! She couldn't fathom why Qian Duoduo and the others had insisted on taking a boat to the stadium without guards, but the attack had happened. And according to Qian Duoduo, one of the assassins had been wearing a National School female student's uniform. This matched the latest intelligence report, issued just an hour ago.

But the report had come too late. Though the Political Security Bureau and the police had been ordered to tail every "suspect," one hundred percent success was impossible, and no one had anticipated the enemy would disguise themselves as students.

Female student uniforms were not available on the market. The National Police had cracked down hard on businesses that counterfeited student, military, and police uniforms, virtually eliminating such goods. How had they obtained them?

The report stated the enemy had acquired three sets of female student uniforms. Since Qian Duoduo had taken down one, two remained at large. They might have already blended into the student crowd at the stadium. If they were to strike, the scene would descend into chaos. Even with increased security for the Elders, the consequences of either the enemy escaping in the confusion or causing mass casualties among the students were unbearable.

There was no time to lose. They had to close the net. A few dozen minutes ago, Wu Mu had informed her that the Political Security Bureau's action teams were in position, preparing to arrest the suspects.

She picked up the phone. "Connect me to the Detective Squad! Old Zhou! Get your men moving immediately! Yes, leave no one behind. Everyone into the operational area. Arrest them according to the list!"

She slammed down the phone and shook the crank violently. "Connect me to the Fangcaodi duty office! Yes, urgent. I need to speak to an Elder!"

Yuan Ziguang answered. Hearing Mu Min's order for the Fangcaodi and College of Arts and Sciences faculty to immediately go to the scene and identify students, he was thrown into a panic. A problem quickly arose: today was a rest day. Many students had not come as part of an organized school group. Organizing students from different schools and classes in a sea of people would be no easy task.

"Then what other way do you have to quickly verify their identities?" Mu Min's voice was hoarse with tension.

On the other end of the line, a group of Elders from the education department were also wiping sweat from their brows. Both Fangcaodi and the College of Arts and Sciences had uniforms, but photo IDs were still limited to the military, police, and political security departments. Relying on student ID cards was not reliable enough. Besides, the enemy was already on site and could attack at any moment.

Bai Yu, the head of the Industrial Arts Teaching and Research Group, spoke slowly, "In this matter, I think we can only test the effectiveness of our usual disciplinary training."

Zhou Zhongjun, Nan Wan'er, and several other female disciples had split up and blended into the plaza in front of the stadium. She and Nan Wan'er, dressed as students, had, as Sima Qiudao instructed, tried to get as close as possible to the special passage the Elders would use.

Ropes had been set up as a security line, and the public was not allowed to cross. Police and Security Army soldiers stood guard. However, they did not prohibit naturalized citizens from approaching. Many students in their school uniforms had gathered on both sides of the passage, chattering excitedly.

The plaza was crowded. Though not yet a sea of people, some areas were already becoming congested. The police had begun to set up barricades to restrict and direct the flow of people.

The plaza was mostly filled with naturalized citizens, but many local residents had also come to watch the excitement. The air was a mix of southern and northern accents. The disciples were both excited and scared. Zhou Zhongjun was particularly thrilled. She had chosen the best-fitting of the student uniforms Seventh Master had provided. Paired with her tall, striking figure, it had a unique charm. Intending to humiliate Nan Wan'er, she had insisted that Nan Wan'er, being highly skilled in martial arts, should also pose as a student. Then she had deliberately given her the smallest set of clothes.

Poor Nan Wan'er's chest was constricted, and the hem of her skirt rode high above her knees. With the slightest movement, a large section of her white thighs would be exposed. She didn't dare pull the skirt down; the blouse was very short, barely covering her waist. To pull the skirt down would be to expose her midriff, making her look even more ridiculous. She could only walk hunched over, step by agonizing step. Nan Wan'er felt like dying. She had refused to go out at first, but after a torrent of abuse from Zhou Zhongjun, she had finally relented, tears in her eyes. Seeing Nan Wan'er's predicament, Zhou Zhongjun felt an indescribable satisfaction. *You love to flirt with men, don't you? Let's see you flirt your fill!*

But once they were outside, Nan Wan'er became the center of attention, completely overshadowing her. Almost every man stared at Nan Wan'er as if bewitched; a few handsome men even had nosebleeds on the spot. The more Zhou Zhongjun walked, the angrier she became. *That damn flirt knows how to seduce men so well. When the time comes, I'll definitely push her in front of me to block a bullet. That will satisfy the hatred in my heart!*

Just then, a soft melody suddenly filled the air, instantly spreading throughout the plaza. The disciples were startled, wondering where a band of musicians could be hidden, and why the music was so loud.
