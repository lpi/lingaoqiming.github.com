And even without the support of a railway, a series of standard villages spaced 3-4 kilometers apart would allow for the rapid deployment of troops and ensure rest and supplies for smaller units.

However, in practice, this system involved various issues such as terrain, soil fertility, and land ownership, so it couldn't be perfectly applied to all regions. Currently, the standard villages being piloted in various locations primarily adopted the architectural form of the standard village.

According to [Wen Desi][y002]'s view, the standard agricultural village was particularly suitable for vast temperate plains with uniform soil, such as the Great Plains of North China and North America. It was also ideal for areas requiring long-term counter-insurgency warfare, as this system allowed for the tightest control over land, population, and resources.

After the first phase of counter-insurgency operations, Xue Ziliang's report to the Executive Committee assessed that Jeju Island's long-term security situation could become a "long-term stable security zone." Therefore, the defense level of the standard villages on Jeju Island was much lower. The villages were not equipped with moats, and there were no mandatory requirements for the building materials of the outer walls and corner towers, in order to further reduce costs and utilize local materials.

The walls of the villages were all built with volcanic gravel native to Jeju Island. The adhesive used was traditional lime mortar—the cement kiln on Jeju Island was still under construction, so this was a temporary substitute. The roofs were tiled. After the completion of the building materials factory, bricks, tiles, gravel, sand, lime, and cement could all be sourced locally. In fact, even in the old world with modern logistics and transportation, the sales radius for common construction materials like cement, sand, and stone would not exceed 500 kilometers, otherwise the logistics costs would be prohibitive, let alone in the 17th century.

Jeju Island was relatively lacking in timber. Currently, wood was mainly salvaged from old buildings, but a significant shortage was anticipated, requiring the import of some timber. However, the Korean peninsula was not short of wood, which could be sourced nearby through trade with Korea. Additionally, Taiwan and Fujian could also supply some timber.

Feng Zongze was not particularly fond of this system. He felt it was a bit "too inhumane"—overly uniform, reminiscent of a prison. He personally preferred villages with a bit more poetic charm. But when he saw the Korean commoners gathered around the display boards and renderings, their faces filled with joy and amazement, he felt a sense of relief.

Feng Zongze had personally been inside the local people's huts: walls made of haphazardly piled stones without even a plaster of mud and straw, and roofs so low that the tall men of the 21st century could bump their heads on the beams. The thatched roofs hadn't been replaced in years, turning black and smelly, a paradise for all sorts of insects and rats. There were no floors inside, not even square bricks, just a dirt ground, with a fire pit that had blackened everything in the hut.

Under these conditions, it was no wonder that skin diseases were rampant among the people of Jeju—especially since the winter temperatures here were relatively high, which was more conducive to the breeding of various bacteria and parasites.

Simply purifying and treating their bodies without providing them with a clean and hygienic living environment would render all the purification procedures futile. Promoting new hygiene habits would be out of the question.

Kim Ta-duo was struggling to lift a large stone. His father, Kim Da-wu, threaded a rope underneath and attached a wooden pole. Kim Da-wu had an injured leg and could only limp around doing odd jobs. Kim Ta-duo and his cousin, Kim San-pang, together carried the stone to pave the retaining wall for the foundation of the No. 1 Animal Husbandry Village of Suwondong, affiliated with the State-owned Jeju First Livestock Farm.

Kim San-pang, who was just over twenty, was not fat at all; on the contrary, he was pitifully thin. A morning of high-intensity labor had left him breathless. Although the Aussie masters were providing food—three meals a day, each with a large bowl of buckwheat rice or boiled flour paste, and unlimited spicy cabbage and salted radishes—it was better than what he ate even in his dreams. But the work was also intense. After a full meal, he would feel hungry again in just over an hour.

The whistle for a break blew. The sweat-drenched brothers walked to the rest station by the construction site, where a large wooden barrel was filled with cool, boiled water. Spring had entered the peak season for gastrointestinal infectious diseases, so an order had been issued forbidding the drinking of unboiled water. Everyone had also been given a bamboo canteen with a lid, tied to their waist with a rope.

A woman in charge of the rest station used a bamboo ladle to fill their cups to the brim. The two men picked up their bamboo cups and drank deeply.

The water was slightly salty—a small amount of salt had been added to replenish their electrolytes.

"Don't drink so fast, you'll choke," shouted a female member of the Public Service Team guarding the rest station.

Kim San-pang didn't even have the strength to talk back. He sat down on the ground, sweat pouring off him. He looked at the standard village under construction, still feeling a sense of disbelief. He nudged Kim Ta-duo with his elbow. "You think they're really building this village for us?"

"The Headman-masters have said so, how can it be false?" Kim Ta-duo and his father, having been captives of the Headman-masters for a few days, were considered the most familiar with the "Headman-masters" among the newly surrendered locals. In truth, the father and son had only eaten a few meals as captives and been "treated and purified" by a few medics. But this experience had already made them feel extraordinary, and they now considered themselves "experts on the Headman-masters."

He immediately put on an all-knowing air. "We are now the slaves of the Headman-masters. What's so strange about the masters saying they'll build some houses for their slaves to live in? Didn't you used to live in Master Kim's house?"

"It's true I lived in Master Kim's house, but can that house be the same as the one in the picture?" Kim San-pang was still skeptical. "That house! It looks even better than the one Master Kim lives in. I'm afraid only people like the Yangban masters could live there..."

"The Yangban masters are nothing!" Strictly speaking, Kim Ta-duo hadn't received many benefits from the Australian masters, but he had witnessed their power, especially the equipment and food they provided for their soldiers. Strength commanded respect and also envy. The weak like to boast about the powerful people they are associated with to gain a sense of psychological satisfaction, so his boasting for the Yuanlao Senate became a bit over the top. "The Headman-masters are incredibly rich. Just the food and clothing for their soldiers, I don't think the Yangban masters can compare..."

Kim San-pang was still a bit unconvinced, but seeing the Japanese-dressed soldiers in their uniform, each one spirited and upright, and all of them strong and sturdy, and even the local soldiers wearing big hats looked very energetic—a complexion he had only ever seen on the faces of masters or merchants before. It seemed Kim Ta-duo wasn't lying.

"I want to be a Public Service Team member too, or even a soldier," Kim San-pang said with envy.

"Me too," Kim Ta-duo sighed, remembering the first full meal he ate after being captured. Because they were the first batch of captives and few in number, there was no specially cooked relief food for them. Instead, they ate field rations from the pots of the Public Security Army. The rich, savory taste was something he could never forget.

"I wonder when they'll recruit soldiers. I want to join the White Horse Team too..."

As the two were chatting, the whistle signaling the end of the break blew. They quickly got up and returned to work—getting hit by the batons of the Public Service Team was no joke.

This time, they were assigned to build the public bathhouse. While dismantling Master Kim's manor, they discovered a hot spring on the property. Jeju Island is a volcanic island with frequent geothermal activity, so it wasn't surprising to find a hot spring. Feng Zongze took a look and found that the sulfur content was high and the water flow was large. The idea of building a hot spring bathhouse came to his mind.

Sulfurous hot springs have a certain therapeutic effect on skin diseases, so he decided to set up a pumping station at the spring to pipe the water to the commercial street of the livestock farm at the foot of the headquarters hill, where a public bathhouse would be built specifically for the local people. Another pipe would divert water for the enjoyment of Nick and other Yuanlao at the headquarters. If a suitable location could be found, building a livestock farm guesthouse would also be a good idea. The mountain pasture scenery here was pleasant, and with the hot spring, it was very suitable for Yuanlao visiting Jeju Island to relax.

Since the pipes, tiles, and pumping equipment needed to be shipped from Lin'gao, only the civil engineering work was being done for now. While Kim Ta-duo and Kim San-pang were busy digging a channel, the Public Service Team started shouting through a loudspeaker.

"Attention, attention! All commune members, gather at the foot of the headquarters hill! The Emperor-Headman is here today and has an important speech!" As if to emphasize the point, the Public Service Team member added, "Anyone who doesn't come or is late will get no dinner tonight!"

"Who is the Emperor-Headman?"

"Seems to be the Great King?"

"Didn't Jeju surrender to the Wako... Headmen?"

"Can't the Headmen have a Great King?"

"..."

Half an hour later, the commune members had assembled. These members were all government slaves and the private slaves of Kim Man-il's family. They were still very unfamiliar with the term "commune member." After a few whacks from the Public Service Team's batons, they finally understood that "commune member" referred to them. It probably meant the government slaves of the new Australian Headman Wako. However, being a commune member slave was still a very happy thing. At least they could eat their fill most of the time, wouldn't be beaten at the slightest provocation, and even had to kneel much less.

Strange music began to play, and banners fluttered. A dozen Wako cavalrymen in greatcoats and conical hats led the way. Behind them was a company of gray-clad soldiers carrying muskets. Under their protection, a group of tall, gray-clad men appeared on the hillside. Among them, a few were clearly leaders, surrounded by the others like stars around the moon. Some who had had contact with the "Headman-masters" recognized one of the gray-clad men as "Master Feng."

Without anyone's command, the commune members below fell to their knees in a disorderly heap.

"Everyone, get up," said a translator from the Public Service Team who had come with the headmen. "The Headman says to get up. If you don't get up, you'll get your bottoms spanked, you hear?"

"Yes..." With a slow and jumbled response, the disorderly crowd stood up again in a chaotic manner.
