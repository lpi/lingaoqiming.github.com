"Thanks," Li Yongxun tossed a string of copper coins and quickly got up to follow them. There were many goods on the pier, making it easy to hide. She walked and stopped, slowly approaching the pier.

The sedan chair was carried all the way onto the pier and stopped next to the ship from Lin'gao. Li Yongxun quickly hid behind a pile of goods, carefully peeking out.

A gangplank was lowered from the Lin'gao ship, and several big men guarded the area around it. Someone helped a master-like figure out of the sedan chair. He wore a "free and easy" scarf, a wide robe, and a rare pair of black crystal glasses on his face. The master's movements were clumsy. He fumbled around and had to be half-supported and half-carried by two people on either side to barely get on the gangplank. Li Yongxun secretly wondered—why was this person moving so strangely? Could he be sick?

She watched them with great interest. Suddenly, a thought came to her—could this be Censor Gao?! Li Yongxun immediately became nervous. That's right! Her brother-in-law had said that there were two main beneficiaries of Censor Gao's disappearance: the Portuguese and the髡-thieves. It made sense for either side to have kidnapped Gao Shunqin.

She widened her eyes and looked at the group, and the more she looked, the stranger it seemed. The escorting servants surrounded the master so tightly that it seemed they were deliberately blocking the view of others. Their actions were very suspicious.

Li Yongxun was instantly excited. Although there was no reason to believe that the person they were taking away was Censor Gao, besides the strange behavior of the group, she was immediately captivated by the idea of being able to achieve a great merit. The more she looked, the more she felt that this person was Master Gao.

Master Gao had really been kidnapped by the髡-thieves! Now the髡-thieves were taking him to Lin'gao. At this thought, her heart pounded wildly—just getting this news was a great achievement! She had to go back and report to her brother-in-law immediately!

Various scenes of being rewarded for her merit had already appeared in Li Yongxun's mind. Her brother-in-law would surely be pale with anger but helpless. Not to mention her family—the Li family had served as hereditary Jinyiwei for generations. When had they ever had such a glorious achievement? This great merit might even earn her the position of a banner commander or a platoon commander. She had heard that in the early days of the Ming Dynasty, there were also women who served as Jinyiwei, specializing in investigation and arrest.

Her splendid fantasy had not yet ended when she was struck heavily on the back of the head. She fell to the ground with a thud without even a grunt.

The "Dengyingzhou" was a 200-ton class three-masted Guangdong ship. This was the second ship to bear the name "Dengyingzhou." The first "Dengyingzhou" was converted from a fishing boat and was too small to carry much cargo. After the modern equipment such as the diesel engine was removed, it was refitted back into a fishing boat, re-registered in the Lin'gao fishing sequence, and reassigned to the fishery fleet for service.

The new "Dengyingzhou" was formerly a pirate ship under the command of Zhu Cailao. After surrendering to Lin'gao, it was repaired and converted to specialize in freight transport on the Lin'gao-Macau route. Because it was fully armed, it also served as an escort.

In a secret cabin below deck, someone said, "It's a woman!"

"You don't have to tell me that," said another person by the bunk. "You can tell by her ass—do men have such big asses?"

Li Yongxun was lying on a fixed bunk in the cabin, her hands and feet shackled to the bed frame. After being knocked out with a rubber truncheon and secretly brought aboard the "Dengyingzhou," she was given a dose of tranquilizer to prevent her from making a fuss when she suddenly woke up. Several men surrounded her with great interest. A young girl was carefully searching her body, from time to time placing the things she found in a paper box next to her.

There was not much on Li Yongxun: a handkerchief, a small amount of loose silver, and a mirror powder box... The most eye-catching items were the small embroidered spring saber and a dagger she carried with her.

Li Yan drew the saber and looked at it, then examined the scabbard. Besides a "Li" and a "Qian," there were no other characters, especially no affiliation or number—it was not an official saber.

"This woman is probably named Li Qian," he said.

"Why was she tailing us, and with such a saber?"

"Because she's this," Jiang Shan, who had been watching the Political Security Bureau's security officer Ke Yun search the body, frowned and took out a wooden token that was still warm from the paper box. "This is a Jinyiwei waist token."

"Jinyiwei?!" someone next to him muttered. "Are there women in the Jinyiwei in the Ming Dynasty?"

"It's hard to say," Jiang Shan said, turning the token over and over. "The token says it's from the Foshan hundred-household office, an officer..."

"We can just ask her when she wakes up."

"The Jinyiwei are really efficient. They found their way to Macau so quickly. Our smoke screen didn't work."

"This woman seems to be one of the two Jinyiwei who came to Huang Shunlong's house yesterday," Jiang Shan said noncommittally, stroking his chin. It was a pity he didn't have the files on hand. He would have to wait until he returned to Lin'gao to check for any relevant information. Huang Shunlong's attitude towards the transmigrators had become more positive in the past six months. He had begun to provide them with a lot of information that he was previously unwilling to provide.

However, there was no need to return to Lin'gao to find out Li Yongxun's identity. Huang Tianyu was also on this ship returning to Lin'gao. Hearing that a female Jinyiwei had been caught, he immediately ran over to see the excitement.

"Isn't this the runaway girl from the Jinyiwei!" Huang Tianyu immediately recognized the young girl who had drugged him to the ground back then—this little girl had caused him to lose a bottle of tomato sauce and a bottle of chili sauce for nothing.

"You know her?" Jiang Shan asked curiously.

"Of course, I know her. This little girl is full of tricks," Huang Tianyu then recounted the story of how he and Liu San and the others had gone to Foshan and met Li Yongxun on the way.

"Liu San and I wrote a detailed report about this matter after we came back."

"I must read it when I get back," Jiang Shan said, then instructed Ke Yun, "You watch her!"

"Yes, Chief!"

Jiang Shan and the others returned to the conference room in the sterncastle. He said:

"Although this little girl is not a Jinyiwei, she has close ties with them. Since her brother-in-law is a genuine probationary centurion of the Foshan hundred-household office and is now in Macau, it means that the Jinyiwei must have sniffed something out."

"So it was right for us to move Old Gao in time," said Jiang Qiuyan, the only psychologist from the Ministry of Health who had come along. "The Ming Dynasty still has law enforcement power in Macau—although their reaction is much slower." His task was to participate in the interrogation as a psychological analyst.

Originally, the Executive Committee's intention was to get rid of Gao Shunqin on the spot, but the intelligence department believed that as an important official who had served in both the central and local governments, Gao Shunqin had a clearer understanding of the high-level operations of the Ming regime and a good understanding of the officialdom and the social conditions of the time. This was a completely different level from the people they currently had, like Wu Mingjin. He could serve as a useful source of intelligence to enrich the database of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Moreover, the mainland strategy had just begun, and there was no need to rush to physically eliminate officials. Therefore, after obtaining the approval of the Executive Committee, Gao Shunqin was moved to Lin'gao.

Li Yan asked, "What should we do with this little girl?"

"Just throw her into the sea, clean and neat."

"No, this little girl is of no use to us. But there are still many things that need to be interrogated clearly before we decide," Jiang Shan said. "Besides, Lin'gao is short of women right now. We shouldn't waste resources."

"She needs to be nourished," Huang Tianyu said out of the blue. Several people laughed maliciously. Li Yongxun was not bad looking, and her feet were not bound. It was just that her figure and face were both loli-like.

Li Yongxun's strange disappearance put a mysterious end to the entire Gao Shunqin case. After two days of fruitless running around, Lin Ming had to ask the Xiangshan County Magistrate for help. He had to lie and say that he had found traces of Gao Shunqin in Macau—the Xiangshan County Magistrate would not negotiate with the Portuguese to find his sister-in-law.

Hearing that there was a lead on Censor Gao, the Xiangshan County Magistrate and the Xiangshan County Prefect did not dare to be negligent and came to Macau one after another to negotiate with the Portuguese. The Macau Municipal Council did not dare to defy the request of the Ming officials and immediately ordered a city-wide search.

But there was no trace of either Gao Shunqin or Li Yongxun. Only from the tea stall owner at the pier did Lin Ming learn that Li Yongxun had appeared at the pier and had asked about the people from Lin'gao. And she had only left the tea stall after seeing a group of Australians walk by. This greatly increased the suspicion on the髡-thieves. At his request, the Portuguese searched the Lin'gao warehouse in the Fifth Lane and arrested a few people. But upon interrogation on the spot, it was found that they were all Macau locals, just hired to guard the goods.

Just as he was about to further investigate the Australians' businesses and ships in Macau, a message came from Guangzhou: Li Fengjie told him not to harass the Australians too much—he was very afraid of provoking another incident like the shelling of Humen and the burning of the Five Goats Station. With this news, the wind changed. The Xiangshan County Magistrate said that if there was no evidence that Gao Shunqin had been to Macau, it would be inappropriate to continue the search. And the Portuguese also gradually became uncooperative.

Lin Ming was at a disadvantage, being alone in Macau. He had never thought that Gao Shunqin was in Macau in the first place, and he had not found any clues in the past few days. It was difficult to continue searching for Li Yongxun under the pretext of searching for Censor Gao.

Lin Ming's face was ashen. His sister-in-law had most likely fallen into the hands of the髡-thieves—although he didn't know why the髡-thieves had captured her. Now she might have already been sent to Lin'gao. The matter had become very tricky. Not to mention that Lin'gao was now the territory of the髡-thieves, even in the past, Qiongzhou was a place of pestilence that officials avoided.

In the end, she was his relative. When Qianqian's family came to pick her up and failed, he had patted his chest and promised to ensure her safety in Guangdong. Now she had been abducted by the髡-thieves—the髡-thieves' reputation for being lecherous was no joke! If something were to happen, he would have a hard time explaining it to his wife.

"Damn you, you bunch of fucking髡-thieves!" Lin Ming gritted his teeth. "I'll definitely wipe you out!"
