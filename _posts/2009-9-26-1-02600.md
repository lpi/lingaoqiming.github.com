From the beginning, the Executive Committee had focused on the two children of the Gao family. An adult's mindset is difficult to change, but a teenager's is malleable. They have a natural contempt for authority, a love of adventure, and a desperate need to prove themselvesâ€”all qualities that could be exploited.

Each time they crossed over, they spent time with the two children, observing their personalities and abilities. Gao Di, as a boy, was more valuable. Girls, in this era, had a limited social circle. And Gao Di was younger, his character still unformed.

He was intelligent and quick-witted. He learned the bookkeeping and arithmetic [Xiao Zishan][y001] taught him with ease. He handled the small tasks [Wen Desi][y002] gave him with competence. And he always shared the modern candies and snacks he was given with his sister, a sign of a responsible and unselfish character.

When they entered the study, the brother and sister were kneeling on the ground. Bei Wei's eyebrows twitched. [Wen Desi][y002], knowing his aversion to such displays, quickly stopped him.

"Get up," [Wen Desi][y002] said with a smile. "Why are you kneeling? Do you think we are the city gods?"

"We beg the masters to forgive our mother's crime," they said in unison, kowtowing.

"I have already said, the ignorant are not guilty. Get up."

"Thank you for the master's grace." They exchanged a look of joy and quickly stood.

"Gao Lujie, you go out first. I have something to say to Gao Di."

"Yes, master." She responded cheerfully and withdrew.

"Are you familiar with Guangzhou city?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] asked.

"Familiar. I used to run errands for the Gao residence. I got a few coins each time."

"The companions I asked you about, do you still play together?"

"A few have jobs now. The others are idle at home. They often ask me to go out and play."

"Are there any reliable people among them?"

Gao Di raised his head. "Does master want to recruit household servants?"

*A clever child,* [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought. "Not at the moment," he said vaguely. "But it is somewhat related."

"Then please instruct me, master."

"I need a few children who are familiar with the city to report the news and market prices on the streets every day." He listed the goods they were interested in.

"That's easy. You can find out by looking at the water boards at the teahouses of the various guilds."

"Compile all these things into a ledger every day, according to the bookkeeping method I taught you."

"I understand."

"I will give you an extra tael of silver every month as an activity fund. You choose the people, but choose well. No unreliable people, no gossips. And keep a close eye on the news from the Gao family." [Xiao Zishan][y001] stared into his eyes. "If anything happens, don't write it down. Wait until we come and tell us."

Gao Di's face was a mix of fear and excitement.

"Does your family have any friends in the Gao residence?"

"Yes, Uncle Chang, my father's sworn brother. He works as a general servant." He went on to explain that Gao Chang was from his father's hometown, a strong man who knew some martial arts, but was too blunt and had no money for bribes, so he had remained a general servant.

"He's a bachelor?"

"Yes. But Uncle Chang is quite open-minded and doesn't complain much."

The three men exchanged a look. A suitable candidate for development. Someone unappreciated in his current position would be happy to jump ship. Blunt meant straightforward. Not complaining showed a peaceful mentality. And strong and skilled in martial arts was a bonus.

Of course, this was all from his nephew, so it might be an exaggeration. But they needed people, and they couldn't be too picky.

"Should I call Uncle Chang over? He is not on duty today."

"Alright, invite him."

"I'll just say that father is inviting him for a drink, and he will come."

*High comprehension,* [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought. *But a child this clever could be a disaster if not handled well.*

Gao Chang arrived. He was not tall, but strong and agile. [Xiao Zishan][y001] asked about his background and his work in the Gao family.

"I have been a general servant in the outer residence for six years," Gao Chang reported.

"You have a dignified appearance and your skills are not bad. Why have you always been a general servant?"

"I am clumsy by nature and not good with words."

"Have you ever married?"

"No..." he blushed. "I am too poor."

"The Gao family hasn't even assigned you a maid?"

"Even if they did, I'm afraid I couldn't keep her."

*Not bad,* [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought. *His master has shown him no grace, yet he speaks no ill of him.*

"How does the Gao family treat you?"

"I am just a servant. It is a grace for the master to give me clothes to wear and food to eat." He was neither humble nor arrogant.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] glanced at Bei Wei. The former reconnaissance soldier leaped up and gave him a hard push. Gao Chang stumbled back several steps, but stood his ground, his face a mask of surprise.

Bei Wei nodded. The man's stance was stable. He had some skill.

"You know martial arts?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] asked.

"Just some country kung fu, for self-defense. I have made a fool of myself."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] nodded and asked no more questions. He told Gao Di to take him out for a drink.

The interview was a success. But how to recruit him was another matter. For now, they had established their first intelligence network. Its purpose was not to gather intelligence, but to test Gao Di's capabilities and the Gao family's loyalty.

If Gao Qing continued to be Master Gao's spy, they would have to find new people.

"I think Gao Qing's attitude towards Master Gao is ambiguous," Bei Wei said. "His wife and children don't seem to be completely devoted."

"I agree," [Wen Desi][y002] nodded. "Gao Qing is merely intimidated by Gao Ju's power. He doesn't have much loyalty to his old master."

"What he fears more is having to leave his home and follow us. He is not from Guangdong or Fujian, where people are used to going overseas."

"We will first try to win over his wife and children. After today, he will think carefully before he goes to report again."

"Will he still go?"

"I think so, but much less often. Gao Qing is timid. The old master's authority is still there, and he still wants to keep a way out. This person cannot be trusted until he is out of Gao Ju's sphere of influence."

"We need to have our own residence as soon as possible."

"Right. For now, we are looking for convenience in trade, but before the final transmigration, we must get a new residence."

"Gao Di is not bad, but he's a child. He can't buy a residence and servants."

"What about Gao Chang..."

"Someone's here!" Bei Wei shouted, flashing to the window. He picked up a rock from a potted plant and threw it. A muffled thud from outside.

The three urban nerds collapsed in their chairs, their hearts pounding.

"What happened?" [Wen Desi][y002] asked, his voice trembling.

"A black shadow flashed past the corner of the courtyard opposite," Bei Wei said resentfully. "To come and spy before it's even dark, what audacity."

"An eavesdropper?"

"Should be. The route was winding towards the window."

"Is it Gao Ju's man?"

"Doesn't seem like it. He already has eyes and ears here. Our business with him is going so smoothly, there's no need for him to do something like this that would anger us."

"Then who could it be?"

"I'm afraid it's those who are jealous of him," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, remembering what Gao Ju had said: "my place has attracted a lot of attention."

Things were becoming more and more complicated.
