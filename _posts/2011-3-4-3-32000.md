"Of course, there must be an accounting."

Xiao Zishan immediately stepped forward to announce that the first order of business for the caretaker cabinet would be to establish a "Maid Policy Committee," with Wen Desi appointed as its chairman. This committee would be dedicated to discussing and establishing a system and regulations for the procurement, training, and distribution of life secretaries.

"The committee office will be set up in Room 1111 of the Executive Committee compound. A special section will also be opened on the internal BBS for discussion! We guarantee no posts will be deleted and hope everyone will participate enthusiastically," Xiao Zishan announced loudly.

"Cut the crap! Don't let this discussion drag on for another half a year or a year," Sun Li shouted. "Give us a deadline!"

"We will complete the discussion of the plan before the Lunar New Year's Eve. After the Spring Festival, we will send people to handle this matter specifically. Of course, it will be difficult to solve everything at once," Xiao Zishan said. "It can only be resolved gradually, in batches. I hope everyone can understand..."

"We've been understanding for a year and a half. Now, please allow us to be a little less understanding," Shan Liang said, his face glowing and his voice firm and powerful. This feeling was wonderful; he felt fantastic about himself right now. "How many people will be in this first batch? Who gets to be in the first batch, and what determines it? What are the standards? The conditions? Are there measures to ensure fairness and reasonableness, so that the masses are not taken advantage of?" He turned to the crowd and shouted, "The beauties go to the leaders, and the plain ones go to the masses. Do you agree to this?!"

"No!" Sun Li immediately jumped out and led the roar. The crowd, seeing the logic in his words, began to shout along. The quality of the local girls was something everyone had witnessed. While not exactly unbearable, they were mostly at a level that could only satisfy basic physiological needs. Of course, there were always a few exceptions in any group. Who could guarantee that these exceptions wouldn't be snatched up by the leaders first?

Xiao Zishan knew that Shan Liang and his group were determined to build up their own political capital today. But the question was extremely critical and had to be answered seriously.

"This issue..." Just as Xiao Zishan was about to say that this matter had to be decided by everyone together, Wen Desi waved his hand and stepped forward again.

"Comrades!" he shouted, his voice raised. No one had expected the usually calm and steady Chief Wen to suddenly burst forth with such a passionate and resounding voice. He didn't even need a megaphone for everyone to hear him clearly.

"As the chairman of the Maid Policy Committee—this is the organization's trust in me, and it would be disrespectful of me to decline!" Wen Desi said with a broad smile. "I'd like to offer my personal opinion on this matter. I trust no one has any objections?"

The members of the Law Club applauded in unison, and others followed with scattered applause.

Wen Desi, unfazed by the lukewarm reception, continued to passionately elaborate on his plan:

"My personal view is this: to solve this problem effectively, fairly, reasonably, and efficiently, we must introduce the ISO quality management system..."

Seeing the crowd's indifferent reaction, Chief Wen promptly translated this theory into practice. He waved his hand, his voice rising a few notches:

"Everyone draws lots! Whatever number you draw is your number, and you choose your maid according to your rank. Number 1 gets to choose first! However, the person ranked first is not allowed to delay. If you don't pick one from the available candidates within a day, you forfeit your turn—and you become the last in line for this round."

"The next person can only choose after the previous one has finished. If you want to trade, that's also possible—you have to arrange it yourselves and register it with the relevant department—but you can only trade before you've used her! Once you've used her, she's your person, and you can't go back on the trade. We are comrades, not a swingers' club—or a secretary-swapping club. Everyone must pay attention to this point. We must not corrupt our pure social customs and comradely friendship! Also, you can only trade, not give away as a gift: the Group needs you to produce the next generation! In the Bible, spilling your seed on the ground is a capital offense."

"The right to choose, your rank, can also be traded! But, for example, if you are number 1 and you are willing to trade with number 250... well, then he becomes number 1, and you become number 250. The two of you must go and register the trade officially. No backing out."

"You are not allowed to touch another person's exclusive secretary. The punishment for that will be decided by everyone. If I draw a number in the top fifty, I will give up my rank and go to the very end. Or, if I happen to draw a number in the top ten, I will put that rank up as a prize for everyone to draw again... Whoever draws it, I will trade with them and also give them a jar of my privately brewed, secret-recipe rice wine—it strengthens the body and is indescribably wonderful—that's what a mature man does."

Before the crowd could react, An Xi was the first to shout: "Chairman Wen has racked his brains and been so thoughtful for us, the masses. It's truly, truly..." He probably felt that saying "closer than a parent" was too fake and sycophantic, so he quickly changed his line. "He's truly our confidant."

"Not at all, not at all," Wen Desi said with a smile. "Don't call me Chairman anymore. I'm just an ordinary transmigrator now! This is just my humble opinion, for everyone's consideration, and for the caretaker cabinet's reference."

No one applauded or cheered—the members of the Law Club felt that An Xi's words were too crude and sycophantic, and they were too embarrassed to join in.

Ma Jia thought to himself that An Xi's ass-kissing skills were only at a beginner's level, but his "shamelessness" was at a master's level. Although this person was usually very capable, he had to be watched.

The onlookers in the square were half-convinced, but Chief Wen's plan was workable and easy to understand, and their mood stabilized. People began to discuss it in low voices, and some were asking about the details. The atmosphere in the square became a bit more lively, and the confrontational mood greatly improved.

Shan Liang and the others watched as the forgetful masses, as if the revolution had already succeeded, quickly cast aside their representatives. They were all extremely anxious. But Wen Desi's plan was clearly to the liking of the onlookers, and Shan Liang couldn't find a breakthrough to question it. As he was scratching his head in frustration, Cheng Mo, after taking a phone call, suddenly remembered something and squeezed out to shout:

"Comrades, don't be deceived by the Executive Committee! Have you all been blinded by maids? What was our purpose in coming to the Executive Committee? Was it just for a few maids?" he said passionately. "To say your awareness is low, it's really low. Maids are just a symptom. What are we opposing? It's certain people using their power for personal gain!"

The crowd's attention was once again drawn to him. Seeing the favorable situation, Cheng Mo was about to continue when Shan Liang, seeing that the spotlight was about to be stolen, quickly jumped out:

"The corrupt element hidden among the people, Chang Shide, is a case in point. If you say Leizhou is dangerous, isn't Wen Tong, the director of the South China Sugar Factory, in danger? Isn't Xiao Gui, the chief technical engineer, in danger? Isn't Zhan Tianxiong from the Political Security Bureau in danger? Wen Tong aside, Xiao Gui worked hard supervising the installation of the sugar manufacturing equipment, and his life was threatened. He doesn't have a maid. Why should Chang Shide, who embezzled public funds to buy a maid for himself, have one? Who approved Chang Shide's purchase of a maid? No one! Who approved Chang Shide's use of a maid? No one!"

Xiao Zishan's face instantly turned ugly. Just as he thought Chief Wen's grand deception was about to settle the matter, another troublemaker had emerged. He thought for a moment and said:

"The various problems you've all mentioned do exist at this stage. That's why we've dissolved the Executive Committee and are preparing to convene the Second General Assembly. At the assembly, we will all discuss and resolve these issues together." He paused. "So, the second order of business for the caretaker cabinet is to establish a preparatory committee for the Second General Assembly, to jointly discuss the existing problems and find solutions."

"Who are the members of the preparatory committee? Is it going to be another case of a few Executive Committee members getting together and deciding everything?"

"How the preparatory committee is formed, and who its members will be," Xiao Zishan said, "will be decided by all the transmigrators. We plan to open a special discussion board on the internal BBS. Once we have a concrete framework, we will vote to elect the members of the preparatory committee."

"The preparatory committee must have representatives from the masses, otherwise it will be easily usurped by you Executive Committee members."

"First, we are not Executive Committee members, just members of the caretaker cabinet," Xiao Zishan said, a little annoyed but still maintaining a composed demeanor. "Second, the members of the preparatory committee will be elected by all the transmigrators. There is no question of it being usurped by anyone."

Shan Liang shouted loudly, "This matter must be settled today! We, the entire masses, demand the immediate establishment of an independent supervisory committee for the preparatory committee and the future general assembly, to be elected right here! To specifically supervise the entire process!"

Xiao Zishan frowned, thinking that this was the key point Shan Liang had been driving at all along. These people who were jumping up and down were clearly eyeing the position of "supervisory committee member." This was a bit difficult. He couldn't promise or refuse on his own. He was about to look towards Chief Wen and the other silent, stone-faced committee members for their opinion when Ma Jia suddenly emerged:

"We, the masses? I'm sorry, I don't want to be represented by you, and I don't agree with this approach!" he said, his face full of righteousness and his voice firm and powerful. "I am also one of the initiators of this demonstration, but I want to state my position here: the Executive Committee has made mistakes, but its achievements are primary. As for certain individuals attempting to use the Executive Committee's mistakes to throw the Transmigration Group into chaos to achieve their own ulterior motives, I personally will never agree to it. I believe that no one here will agree to be used as a tool! Everything must be based on justice, order, and the rule of law!"

Ma Jia had originally wanted to add, "Mob politics will not be tolerated," but then thought that this phrase could easily be taken personally and affect the overall situation, so it was better left unsaid.

An Xi, quick to seize the opportunity, immediately followed up by shouting:

"We will not be represented!"

Then the members of the Law Club immediately joined in:

"Stability above all else!"

"Down with the ambitious schemers!"
