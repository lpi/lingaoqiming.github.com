[Wang Luobin][y003] had procured a complete set of small-scale cement production equipment that used a vertical kiln, but it required a large amount of coal, which the transmigrators currently lacked.

The other necessary raw materials—clay, lime, and gypsum—had all been found locally. The clay from the brickworks' quarry was low in sand and reddish in color, indicating a high iron content, which made it ideal for cement production. While the lime produced from shells at Bopu was low in calcium carbonate, a chalk deposit was found near the quarry. Gypsum hadn't been discovered nearby yet, but its absence wasn't a critical problem.

After much consideration, [Wang Luobin][y003] decided against installing the full equipment set, which had strict temperature and raw material requirements. Instead, he opted for a simpler, makeshift method to produce a cement substitute to meet immediate construction needs. This substitute was known as "artificial pozzolanic cement," a type that had been produced in some rural areas in the past. It didn't require a complex process; simply put, fired bricks, tiles, or pottery were crushed into a fine powder. Alternatively, lime and clay could be calcined directly in a kiln. The process was extremely simple, requiring a calcination temperature of only 600-800°C, far lower than the 1450°C needed for modern Portland cement. Its properties were similar to ancient "pozzolanic cement." The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway had been built with this type of cement, and it was widely used for infrastructure in China's southwestern rear during the Anti-Japanese War.

[Wang Luobin][y003] knew of its existence but wasn't sure of its viability. He ordered a batch of fired red bricks from the brickyard for an experiment. Laborers manually broke the bricks into small pieces. The initial plan for grinding was to use human or animal-powered stone rollers—they had found plenty at the Bairen Beach quarry—but after an hour, the efficiency was abysmal, yielding only 10 kilograms of powder.

After grinding and sifting the powder, [Wang Luobin][y003] mixed it with lime and water. Before the watchful eyes of the entire construction team, the mixture was used to lay a wall. Everyone was excited to see if this legendary substitute cement would actually work.

Once it dried, the fired-clay cement proved perfectly usable. While it couldn't compare to true Portland cement, it served as an effective binder for building materials and could even be used to make low-strength concrete.

This discovery electrified everyone. Even Zhao Wu, the mason tasked with smashing bricks, was visibly thrilled. In his fifteen years as a mason, he had always used a mixture of yellow mud, lime, and water as mortar. The most sophisticated binder he knew was a plaster mixed with glutinous rice juice. Now, this group of "pirates" had created a mortar that could bind bricks firmly together simply by grinding up other bricks! It was beyond his imagination. Were they really just pirates? He made a mental note to remember this technique. He was almost glad he had been captured.

This cement was the transmigrators' first truly modern industrial product. Though imperfect, it was a critical step forward. Cement was the fundamental material of modern construction.

However, the grinding efficiency was still far too low. At the current rate, they could only produce 240 kilograms in 24 hours of continuous work—a negligible amount.

The mechanics team designed and built a simple automated grinding mill. Using two stone rollers from the quarry, they constructed an electric double-roller mill. The rollers were connected by a central axle to a vertical shaft fitted with bearings to reduce friction. A flywheel on a rocking frame drove a set of bevel gears via a chain, turning the stone rollers.

Feeding and sifting were still manual, which was inefficient and created a serious risk of silicosis—a deadly occupational disease. Although the laborers were captives, their lives were still valuable assets. [Zhan Wuya][y004] and a few mechanics devised an improvement. They added a wooden wheel to the bevel gear, which drove a grain-winnowing fan with a belt. Material was fed through a funnel at the top of the vertical shaft. The ground powder flowed down a ramp into the winnower, where airflow separated the coarse particles from the fine. The coarse particles were carried by a conveyor back to the funnel to be ground again. This ingenious contraption of iron, wood, and stone could process nearly a ton of crushed brick per day.

With cement secured, the next requirement for the Hoffman kiln was refractory bricks. Refractory bricks are a cornerstone of modern industry; without them, not only kilns but also future blast furnaces would be impossible. Fortunately, Lingao had local sources of refractory materials. The transmigrators found alumina and silica near the brickworks and were able to fire the necessary bricks easily.

With refractory bricks and cement, building the Hoffman kiln was a straightforward task for the construction team. A few days later, its tall, brick-red chimney belched thick black smoke into the sky for the first time.

"Damn, that's beautiful," someone murmured. A look of rapt fascination filled the transmigrators' eyes. The smoke, a symbol of pollution and backwardness they had once despised, was now the most beautiful sight in the world. Watching it, [Wang Luobin][y003] began to understand why the Great Leader had shown no sentiment for Beijing's ancient city walls, ordering their demolition while proclaiming that "Beijing's chimneys should be as dense as a forest." The ancient walls were mundane to the people of that time; it was the scarcity of modern industry that symbolized a nation's progress.

Now, the proud chimney of their kiln stood against the green hills and clear waters of the Wenlan River. To the transmigrators, it wasn't an eyesore; it was a declaration. Their industrial age had officially begun.

The kiln needed to be pre-heated before firing could begin. The construction team set off for Bopu to build a wood-drying kiln for the timber processing plant. With a proper drying kiln, the timber team could provide a steady supply of quality lumber for the Bairen City construction site, replacing the inconsistently dried, warp-prone wood from the current earthen kilns. [Wang Luobin][y003] didn't join them. He figured [Luo Duo][y011] could find the necessary plans and specifications in a book; he'd never seen such a thing during his time in Guangxi.

As he watched the construction team drive off in their farm truck, a thought struck him. He quickly called Mei Wan. "Talk to the timber team and have them build a wood carbonization kiln as well."

"A carbonization kiln?" Mei Wan asked, unfamiliar with the term.

"It's for making charcoal. Talk to [Luo Duo][y011]; he'll know. You guys look into it and see when you can get it into production."

With no coal, charcoal was the next best thing. The dry distillation of wood would not only produce charcoal but also wood tar, a complex chemical compound from which many useful substances could be extracted. Furthermore, charcoal's energy output was comparable to coal.

The mess hall sent a food cart to the workers at the brickworks. By now, Wu De had used his stick to teach them the concept of lining up. Queuing was a fundamental aspect of social order, a way to ensure reasonably fair access to resources. Wu De mused that the Chinese dislike for queuing wasn't a matter of personal character, but likely a product of long-term resource scarcity. In such an environment, following the rules meant losing out, so everyone learned to rush and push. He felt there was some truth to that.

Just like at mealtime now. Despite the team leaders trying to maintain order, the lines were still a chaotic mess. Everyone wanted to be first, and only the fear of the transmigrators kept the lines from collapsing completely.

Wu De was generally satisfied with his laborers' performance. Throughout the project, he had wandered the site, observing the teams. Most men worked hard, not out of any sense of duty, but because of the rivalry between the five team leaders. No one wanted their team to look bad in front of Wu De. True to the old saying, "the collaborators are often crueler than the invaders," the five leaders were extremely zealous in pushing their men. But that wasn't enough. Wu De knew their diligence was born of fear. To make them work hard willingly, he needed a different kind of motivation.

He decided to start with food. After each captive had received his bowl of thin porridge, Wu De had a basket brought forward. The strange-looking basket, woven by the mechanics team, reeked of dried seafood. It contained the mess hall's less-than-successful attempt at salted fish.

"Today, Wang Tian's team worked the hardest and produced the most," Wu De announced from atop a mound of earth. "Therefore, every man in his team gets an extra salted fish."

The promise of an extra reward made many eyes widen. Since their capture, they had received two meals of thin porridge a day. For men who had lived their whole lives on the edge of starvation, this was tolerable. But the lack of anything salty, like pickled vegetables, combined with the diuretic effect of the porridge, had left them feeling weak after just two days.

"For his excellent leadership, Wang Tian gets two fish." The reward made Wang Tian's face beam with excitement. The other four leaders looked on with envy. The extra fish was a small thing, but the loss of face was a major blow. They all began plotting to make an example of a few slackers in their own teams that evening.
