Lin Ming returned to the shop, found Shopkeeper Qian, and asked for leave, saying he wanted to go out for a stroll.

Since there was no curfew in Lingao at night, he thought it would be better to go out for a walk at night to get a feel for the roads and gather some information.

"You don't need to ask for leave to go out. After our shop closes, you can go out as you please, just remember to be back before the big clock strikes ten. Otherwise, you'll have to ask the gatekeeper to leave the door open for you..." Shopkeeper Qian instructed, taking a folded paper from his drawer. "You've just arrived in Lingao and are not familiar with the roads. This is a map of the East Gate Market printed by our shop. Although it's not very detailed, the general routes are all clear. Take it with you."

"Thank you, shopkeeper." Lin Ming was overjoyed. He had originally planned to "case the joint" himself in the next few days to learn the roads, but he hadn't expected there to be a ready-made map! He took it and opened it, secretly praising it. The map was exquisitely drawn, with the roads and shops marked clearly with very fine characters, making it easy to see at a glance.

Although this folded map was funded and printed by the Haixing Firm, with the Haixing Firm's name at the top and bottom, and the shop's location specially marked with a black circle, the actual map used was a public version of the "East Gate Market Traffic and Tourism Map," which was actually produced by the Remote Exploration Office. However, because it was a civilian map, some important departments, facilities, and roads had been erased.

Even so, the level of detail in this map was rare for its time. Lin Ming hid the map in his bosom and went out of the shop.

Before going out, Lin Ming carefully considered his options. Following the usual method of gathering information, he would first find a lively place to "listen for leaks"—teahouses and restaurants were good places where people from all walks of life gathered to gossip and tell stories. He might hear some useful information there.

However, he was not very confident in this method, because it had been almost two years since Li Yongxun was captured and taken to Lingao. For the people here, it was no longer fresh news, and it was unlikely anyone would mention it. But he had no other choice now and could only try his luck.

Moreover, he had heard that some "true 髡 (kūn - a derogatory term for the Australians)" also liked to frequent the market for entertainment. If he could find an opportunity to get close and try to befriend them, he might get some useful information, or even help with his actions. If rescue was really impossible, kidnapping a "true 髡" to force an exchange was also a feasible method.

He had originally wanted to ask someone which street was the liveliest and which were the famous restaurants and teahouses in the East Gate Market. Now, with the map in hand, a quick glance showed that all kinds of places were marked in detail, saving him the trouble of even asking. He couldn't help but feel secretly pleased.

Lin Ming left the shop and followed the route pointed out by the Wang siblings. He wanted to see what Wang Jinchun's so-called prosperous night scene was like. After turning a corner, he found that the lights in the distance were even brighter. Although he was still a few alleys away, he could already hear a burst of noise. He couldn't help but quicken his pace.

The roads here were very easy to recognize. The streets and houses of the East Gate Market were all built on open ground, without a maze-like old city. Therefore, the streets and alleys were all as straight as a chessboard, square and orderly. Except for a few main roads that had special street names, the side roads and small alleys were all numbered with "Jing" and "Wei," which was clear at a glance. There were also signposts at the intersections and ends of the alleys, which was very convenient.

As Lin Ming walked along, he saw that there were more and more people on the street: men and women, old and young, some in 髡贼 attire, and some in Ming dynasty clothing. Some were walking in a hurry, while others were strolling leisurely. Lin Ming could see that although these people were dressed differently in terms of wealth, there were no people in rags or extreme poverty. Their complexions were also good. It was clear that the ordinary people here lived a good life.

After walking half a street, he saw a three-bay, four-pillar stone memorial archway standing in front. Lin Ming was secretly surprised. The East Gate Market was built after the 髡贼 arrived. It was originally just a wasteland by the Wenlan River, with no villages or towns. Where did this memorial archway come from? And there would be no chastity memorial archways or official rank memorial archways. When he got closer, he realized that it was newly built. The top of the archway was inlaid with three large Song-style characters: "East Gate Market."

After passing through the memorial archway, the number of stalls and vendors on the side of the street suddenly increased. A half-grown boy with a large square box hanging from his neck by a cloth strap was shouting, "Cigarettes, Australian lighters, osmanthus candy!", and a few small children were holding a stack of paper and shouting, "The latest 'Ship's Paper'! Guangzhou, Shanghai, Manila, today's latest arrival prices!" After a while, he heard a man standing next to a handcart with a square box on it shouting, "Australian films, Australian films, Tokyo is hot recently! All new episodes you haven't seen before!", "Freshly baked takoyaki, if you haven't eaten it, you haven't been to Lingao!", "Lingao noodles! Authentic Lingao noodles!", "Big meat buns, big meat buns, white skin, lots of meat, one bite and your mouth is full of oil!"

As for the fixed stalls and shopfronts on the side of the street, they were even more dazzling. The shops here were not closed, and every one was brightly lit, illuminating the street as if it were daytime. All kinds of goods were on display. Some even set up stalls in front of their shops to sell their goods.

Lin Ming felt that his eyes were not enough. He had originally thought that Guangzhou was already a rare place in the world where all kinds of rare and exotic goods were gathered, but he had not expected that compared to here, it was not even a fraction. Just the various foods and snacks sold at the roadside stalls, there were many he had never seen before. He only felt the fragrant smell, which made him swallow his saliva from time to time. Because he was short of money and didn't know what other expenses he would have, he didn't dare to spend a single cent recklessly.

He saw many young women in 髡贼-style clothes on the street, in groups of three or five, holding various snacks, eating and laughing as if no one else was around. He couldn't help but be secretly surprised: it was already shocking for women to be out at night, and they didn't even have a man with them. What kind of propriety was this? What if they were harassed or abducted?

Looking at the street again, there were indeed many women without male companions, and some were even walking alone on the street. Lin Ming secretly clicked his tongue: needless to say, the public security here must be excellent, but what kind of custom was it for women to be so unrestrained? Even the Song Dynasty was not like this.

"Indeed, they are overseas barbarians," Lin Ming sighed to himself.

"Excuse me, let me through, let me through," someone behind him shouted repeatedly. A short, sturdy man pulling a cart brushed past him. The bell on the cart rang wildly, and he had already run more than ten zhang away.

At this time, there were very few horse-drawn carts and mule carts loading goods on the street. Instead, there were many "Australian carts." To Lin Ming, it looked like an armchair covered with cloth with wheels on both sides, and two long handles in front for the driver to pull. There were also a few folded bamboo frames covered with cloth on the back, which seemed to be able to be propped up to form a canopy. The drivers wore blue cloth jackets with a string of "Arabic numerals" painted on the back. They pulled the carts at high speed through the crowd, the bells on the carts ringing incessantly.

There were almost no sedan chairs or litters in the East Gate Market; the streets were full of these "Australian carts"—locally called "rickshaws." A few of them were exquisitely decorated. Not only was there a large golden five-pointed star on the back of the seat, but there was also a lamp on each side of the seat, of some unknown kind, which was dazzlingly bright.

In the stream of these Australian carts, there were also a few two-wheeled "Dongfeng" horse-drawn carriages, pulled by Mongolian horses, trotting proudly on the street. The driver, wearing a cloak, stood behind the carriage to drive, which made Lin Ming click his tongue in wonder.

Strolling on the street, he saw that the night was already deep in the entire East Gate Market. Lin Ming estimated that it was probably past nine o'clock, but the liveliness and prosperity of the street had not diminished. He knew that if this were in the Ming Dynasty, even on the liveliest brothel streets at night, there would be very few pedestrians at this time. The guests seeking pleasure would either be listening to music and feasting in the deep courtyards of the brothels, preparing to stay the night, or they would have already returned to their residences.

As he was thinking, he suddenly saw a four-wheeled carriage parked on the open ground at the side of the street at the crossroads ahead. Two Mongolian horses with blinders stood under the streetlight, eating fodder from their feedbags. The carriage was very large and strangely decorated: the two ends were painted black, and the middle was white. Two large black Song-style characters were painted on the body of the carriage: "Police." There were also two lamps on the front of the carriage, one red and one blue. An Australian "public servant" wearing a conical hat and a black cloth jacket, with a belt around his waist, stood on the footboard, looking around. The upper half of another "Australian officer" was exposed from the top of the carriage. He was holding a telescope and would occasionally raise it to look into the distance.

Lin Ming followed the direction of the telescope on the roof of the carriage and saw a tall tower not far away, at least four or five stories high. The street below was brightly lit, but there was not a single light on this tower, making it look dark and mysterious. Lin Ming looked closer and saw that there were lights flashing at the top, long and short.

He watched for a moment and roughly understood that the length and flashing of the lights were transmitting signals. There must be an official of the Australian "Five-City Military and Horse Division" on this tower, commanding the officers to maintain order and control the streets.

"The 髡贼 really have a way!" While Lin Ming was looking around, a broken sentence suddenly drifted to his ear: "...someone...resisting arrest...reinforcements immediately..."

Lin Ming's body trembled. It was a woman's voice! And that voice was the one he had been dreaming of for years, his sister-in-law, Li Yongxun's!

He quickly turned around to look. The carriage had already started. Someone was ringing a bell on the carriage. With the urgent ringing of the bell, the pedestrians and vehicles on the street all made way.

Lin Ming took a few quick steps, about to chase after it to see what was going on, when he saw seven or eight more "police" in conical hats and black clothes running on the street. Some were holding short batons, and some were holding muskets, all running in the direction the carriage was going.

Seeing this situation, there must have been a major case here. Lin Ming immediately changed his mind. At this time, there might be a "city-wide search." If he rashly followed, he might be detained for questioning. Although he had a full set of documents, it was better to have less trouble than more. It was best not to have direct contact with the 髡贼's government, to avoid revealing any flaws.
