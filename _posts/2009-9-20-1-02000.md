With the conclusion of the "First Institutional Framework Meeting," the transmigration plan finally entered the substantive preparation stage. These professional groups were assigned to prepare plans, proposals, and procurement lists for their respective professional fields. The number of people notified to report for duty also gradually increased.

Every person who arrived, after registration, had to undergo a 30-day full-time basic military training. The training content included drill, earthwork, obstacle courses, combat, and basic survival skills.

After the training, based on their abilities and intended profession, they were arranged by the General Affairs Group to either be transferred to various professional groups for planning and preparation work, or to undergo relevant training and learning—with a focus on developing practical skills. [Zhan Wuya][y004]'s small machinery factory had now basically become a technical school, piled high with scrapped parts. Based on the suggestions of the various professional groups, some people were also selected to be sent by the Transmigration Company to vocational training schools for short-term skills training.

Former IT elites were now learning to lay bricks and tiles; former office clerks were now learning to operate sewing machines; and many more who had never set foot in a workshop were now clumsily learning a trade around machine tools or workbenches.

The transmigrators who were originally engaged in technical work, in addition to being busy with daily documents and meetings, also had to take on the responsibility of training.

[Wu Nanhai][y009]'s responsibility was even greater. He was responsible for educating a group of people who had never been in a field into agricultural science and technology workers. Although some transmigrator families were also from rural backgrounds, there were basically no one who had actually worked on a farm. Being able to distinguish between wheat seedlings and chives was already very good.

One thing was set in stone: everyone living at the base, regardless of their work, had to participate in long-distance running every morning to strengthen their physique. As [Chief Wen][y002] had instructed: "If you can't beat them, you at least have to be able to outrun the natives."

The Sports Group also organized many military sports games, which were held every evening after dinner, as an important means of exercising the body and reaction skills.

Not everyone who came would come, and not everyone who came would stay. Some hesitated, some backed out—after all, this society still had too many things for most people to be attached to. To throw oneself into that other world of time and space, to gamble for an unknown future, required great courage. In addition, some people thought that transmigration was an opportunity to escape social constraints and do whatever they wanted. Now they had to face long-term training, and were also subject to a strict schedule and various rules and regulations. They became impatient and left after a few days.

The people who stayed continued their work. Influenced by the feverish excitement of the unprecedented adventure of tampering with history, this group of people drafted all kinds of plans and proposals almost without sleep. Every night when [Xiao Zishan][y001] walked down the corridor, he could hear the shouting, arguing, and keyboard tapping from the various offices. The General Affairs Group had to distribute a lot of tea and coffee every day—cigarettes were not provided, as they were a luxury.

The large amount of organizational and coordination work posed a great challenge to the organizational and management capabilities of the transmigrators. If this were not a group organized for another time and space, the chaotic situation in the initial stage would have been enough to cause it heavy financial losses. When [Xiao Zishan][y001] handed over one red envelope after another to the finance department, although he knew that this money would no longer have any meaning to him, he still felt a great pain in his heart... When had he ever received so many red envelopes?

The Executive Committee did not realize at the time what a complex system engineering project they were involved in organizing. There were thousands of items involved in the preparation work, many of which only professionals knew how important they were. The complex system of the modern industrial system amazed [Xiao Zishan][y001], who handled many procurement lists every day.

Fortunately, the IT group set up an OA system for the entire system. This OA system, with different permissions set, allowed the Executive Committee to clearly know the personnel situation, work progress, material reserves, and various plans. [Wen Desi][y002]'s desk was finally no longer piled high with documents.

The preparation work for every project was progressing smoothly. The only thing that remained unchanged was the sports equipment. It had been kept in its original state.

The so-called sports equipment was of the same nature as the deceptive Sports Group. It was actually a code name for weapons, especially firearms. Knives, although they were controlled items, could still be obtained through many normal channels. Through the internet, one could buy all kinds of knives: from the Ming Dynasty Japanese-style northern border army folding steel infantry longsword that [Chief Wen][y002] himself had spent a fortune of 30,000 yuan on, with a handle length of 80 cm and a blade length of 120 cm, to five or six of the famous three-edged bayonets, to Japanese sword-style bayonets, and European and American M9s, D80s... there was almost everything. There were also many heated debates about what kind of knife to choose. But on the issue of guns, there were many people who were full of knowledge and could spout data off the top of their heads, but there was no one who could actually get a gun.

But there are always golden fingers in the world, just as transmigrators are always struck by lightning.

On this day, a mysterious visitor came to [Chief Wen][y002]'s office.

Well, that's not entirely accurate. The visitor was actually a man in his late thirties, very ordinary, looking like an intellectual, dressed simply but elegantly. When Xi Yazhou was called into the office, he was talking to [Wen Desi][y002] about something, and the several Executive Committee members around them were all looking excited.

"Could he be an arms dealer?" Xi Yazhou's vigilance suddenly rose. Recently, the most discussed topic in the Executive Committee was the matter of acquiring weapons. Could they have found such a person themselves? Too reckless! People in this line of work are not to be trifled with. He couldn't help but feel a little annoyed at [Chief Wen][y002]'s rashness.

"Let me introduce you," [Wen Desi][y002] noticed the change in Xi Yazhou's expression. "This is Shi Niaoren. A doctor."

"Dr. Shi, hello. I am Xi Yazhou."

"A pleasure!" Shi Niaoren shook his hand. "We will be comrades-in-arms soon." After saying that, he burst into laughter.

"Dr. Shi came back from the United States specifically to participate in our operation," [Wen Desi][y002] explained. "He is the helmsman of the North American Branch."

"I wouldn't dare say that," Shi Niaoren waved his hand. "There are four of us in North America this time who have made up our minds to participate in the transmigration. Little Rui even sold his house to buy guns for everyone!"

"Buy guns!" This word sent a shiver down Xi Yazhou's spine. He had not been very enthusiastic about getting guns because he knew there was little hope. At most, they could get some more five-shot pump-actions at a high price through online channels. Now, someone could directly buy modern firearms—this was not just a step up for the transmigrators' combat power, but a leap.

"Yes, buy guns." Shi Niaoren was actually an infectious disease doctor. Because he also spent a lot of time online, he learned about this operation. He came back to the country alone this time precisely because he knew about the transmigrators' lack of weapons and came specifically to discuss it.

"Tell us about it. What kind of guns are we buying?"

"Of course, it's the Type 56 carbine. The price is cheap, and the quantity is sufficient." Shi Niaoren explained that although the price of SKS series semi-automatic rifles in the United States had risen a lot, they were still relatively cheap weapons: the Yugoslavian ones were less than $300, and the Norinco ones were $400. There were enough in the gun stores. If you had the money, you could buy as many as you wanted.

"Can we buy AKs? What about machine guns?" [Wang Luobin][y003] became excited.

"Semi-automatic AKs can be bought, but automatic weapons are out of the question." Shi Niaoren was a little regretful.

"No way? Are some states more lenient? There are quite a few people in the United States who legally own automatic weapons."

"Yes, to buy automatic weapons, you need a Class 3 license and have to pay an annual tax. That's not a big problem—some states are more lenient, so it's not a problem if you want to get one. The problem is that this type of automatic weapon must have been on the market before 1987. This is restricted by the Firearms Owners' Protection Act passed in 1986. So now, automatic weapons are not only ridiculously expensive, but they are also generally old and in poor condition."

"Is that so..." Everyone was a little disappointed. To them, it seemed that machine guns were the most reliable ultimate weapon.

"It's okay, having semi-automatic weapons is also very powerful." Xi Yazhou was obviously not too concerned about whether they were fully automatic or semi-automatic.

"We just want to ask the Executive Committee for instructions on what kind of gun is better to buy." Shi Niaoren was a little embarrassed. "Actually, I don't play with guns. Although Little Rui is more familiar, he is not a professional. There are soldiers and senior enthusiasts here, so you should know our needs better."

"Then let's go with the Type 56 carbine," [Wang Luobin][y003] said with some disappointment. "Most of the people here have fired it during military training and have also disassembled it. It's a relatively familiar weapon."

"No, I don't see it that way. The Type 56 carbine is not a good choice."

The person who said this was Xi Yazhou, who came from a military background and theoretically should have a deep affection for the Type 56 carbine.
