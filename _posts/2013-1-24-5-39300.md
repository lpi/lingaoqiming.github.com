Ma Linxi's spring had arrived. In the past, when he built houses, his various whimsical ideas were dismissed by his master and peers as "heretical" and "nonsense," but here, they were approved by the Headman. Especially after he read a few books on modern carpentry techniques that Shi Dafu had specially lent him, it was as if a door to a new world had opened for him. Ma Linxi deeply felt that the hardships and suffering he had endured while learning from his master were nothing compared to what the Headman taught him; the difference was like that between a mustard seed and a large turnip. Overwhelmed with gratitude, he studied even more diligently, and his skills progressed by leaps and bounds. He soon became a famous naturalized citizen carpenter in Kaohsiung.

This time, for the construction of the large clock at the customs house, Zhong Lishi specifically requested him to lead the construction team.

Zhong Lishi explained the structure of the large clock to Westerly on the blueprint: "This is the power source of the large clock, powered by a lifted weight. It needs to be lifted once a day... This is the heart of the large clock, the pendulum, which obtains power to swing continuously, making the clock keep accurate time... These gears adjust the speed, ultimately driving those hands to indicate the time... This is the striking mechanism, used for chiming..."

Westerly looked at the blueprint and sighed with admiration, "It's truly magnificent... Where are you in the process now?"

"We are currently installing the gears, which requires precision..."

"I know metalworking and carpentry, so I should be competent."

Kretia said with a smile, "You can trust his craftsmanship."

After getting permission, Westerly hurried back to his room to get his luggage, which turned out to be full of various tools he had prepared. He immediately started working according to the blueprint.

Ma Linxi and the other craftsmen watched in amazement: not only had a foreigner come, but he could also do carpentry! Ma Linxi was a person who loved to learn, and he immediately went over to look at the other's tools and skills. Although the two did not speak the same language, craftsmen communicate with their skills. After a while, they began to communicate slowly with gestures.

Watching Westerly working with the craftsmen, Zhong Lishi said to Kretia, "This young man is very smart and very capable..."

"He is a clever and skillful boy," Kretia said proudly. "He loves science and is particularly fond of all kinds of novel devices. He wants to be a figure like Leonardo da Vinci." Then she added a little embarrassedly, "You probably don't know who Leonardo da Vinci is..."

"Of course I know him," Dr. Zhong said with a smile. "But few people in Europe know him anymore, right?"

"Yes," Kretia was a little surprised. Although Leonardo da Vinci was highly renowned during his lifetime, he was quickly forgotten after his death and was only "rediscovered" in modern times. In the 17th century, few people still remembered him.

And so, Westerly and Kretia helped out on the clock tower. In their spare time, Zhong Xiaoying taught them Mandarin, and sometimes they would go on outings together—the friendship between the three teenagers grew day by day.

About ten days passed like this. That night, Kretia was writing down the day's events in her diary with a quill pen as usual. Unexpectedly, she ran out of the ink she had brought with her halfway through. Westerly, having worked all day, was sound asleep. Kretia didn't want to disturb him and went to look for Zhong Xiaoying, who lived on the same floor, to borrow some ink—light was still showing from under her door.

Zhong Xiaoying was lying on her bed, writing the math homework Zhong Lishi had left for her. The homework was very difficult for her, and she was stuck and bored. Seeing Kretia come to find her, she was overjoyed.

The two of them chatted for a while with a combination of words and gestures—Zhong Xiaoying tried to get Kretia to help her with the math problems, but Kretia didn't know a single Chinese character and was completely ignorant of modern mathematical symbols.

However, Kretia noticed that the pen she was writing with was very special. The nib was made of metal, and Zhong Xiaoying didn't have to dip it in ink for a long time.

Kretia asked curiously, "Your pens are so strange. Do they never run out of ink?"

"Not exactly..." Zhong Xiaoying opened the pen, revealing the ink reservoir inside. "This is called a 'fountain pen.' There's a glass tube inside that serves as an ink reservoir. Inside the glass tube is a capillary device made of shellac, with many slits to store ink. My father's fountain pen has a soft rubber sac, which is even better, but unfortunately, rubber is too expensive. Mine is a cheaper one."

It took Zhong Xiaoying a long time to explain what "rubber" was to Kretia. She immediately remembered, "I know! Last year, your people went to Batavia and helped the company plant that kind of tree, rubber."

"Yes, that tree grows well in the tropics."

"This pen is so good. Do you sell them here?"

"Unfortunately, it has just been developed and has not yet been put into production. But Father said he's going to open a fountain pen factory in a while."

Seeing that Kretia liked it, Zhong Xiaoying took out a new pen that had just come from the Ministry of Science and Technology's factory from her drawer and gave it to Kretia. "This is for you. I've polished the nib, so it's easier to use. But you can only use the ink produced in Lingao, otherwise it will get clogged. I'll give you a big bottle of ink too."

"Thank you so much," Kretia was overjoyed with this gift. She held it up to her chest and examined it for a long time. "Can I give it to Westerly?"

"Of course you can," Zhong Xiaoying said, sighing at her affection for her brother.

"What's wrong? Don't you have any brothers?"

"I used to. They and my parents are all dead."

"Dead? Isn't Dr. Zhong your father?"

"No, he is my adoptive father." Zhong Xiaoying did not want to dwell on the sad past and turned away to wipe the tears from the corners of her eyes. "The Yuanlao Senate saved me from a hell worse than death. They are also my great benefactors."

"I see. No wonder you two don't look alike at all."

Zhong Xiaoying burst out laughing, "Of course we don't look alike—I used to be Dr. Zhong's maid. Later, he adopted me as his daughter."

Kretia was very surprised. This was very incredible to Europeans at that time—even in the Seven Provinces Republic, which was said to be the most "equal" and "enlightened."

Zhong Xiaoying did not want to dwell on the past. She looked at Kretia, "You're wearing too much—don't you feel hot?"

Kretia was wearing a linen petticoat and a tight corset. To Zhong Xiaoying, who was only wearing a nightgown made of high-count linen from Lingao, it looked both awkward and hot. Besides, her forehead was covered with beads of sweat.

"I do feel a little hot, especially the corset. It often makes me feel like I can't breathe—it's probably because the weather is too hot."

"I think you should change your clothes, especially your corset—Father said it's bad for your health," Zhong Xiaoying said, climbing off the bed and opening her suitcase.

Among the naturalized citizens, the "Headmen's maids" were the class with the most purchasing power. Although the General Office did not pay them a salary, a considerable part of the Yuanlao's monthly income was spent on them. It could be said that the maids drove the consumption of the Yuanlao Senate.

Zhong Xiaoying was an adopted daughter, so her consumption level was even higher. Zhong Lishi was very willing to spend money on her, so her wardrobe was quite extensive.

Zhong Xiaoying took out a loose nightgown and a cotton bra.

"They are all new, I haven't worn them," Zhong Xiaoying said. "I think your figure is similar to mine, so they should fit."

Kretia looked at the bra curiously—she had never seen such underwear before. She was eager to try it and immediately began to untie the laces of her corset. Zhong Xiaoying also came to help.

As soon as the corset was untied, revealing her neck, Zhong Xiaoying was greatly surprised: Kretia's fair, white neck below her face was actually dark! This level of dirt meant she hadn't bathed in at least a few months.

Kretia noticed her surprise, "What's wrong?"

"Kretia, you haven't bathed in a long time, have you?" Zhong Xiaoying said in surprise.

"Not since before leaving Batavia. What's wrong?" Kretia said nonchalantly. "I wash my face, hands, and feet every day. They are very clean. And I change my clothes every day."

"But you don't bathe—how can just changing clothes be enough?" Zhong Xiaoying was very surprised by her theory. When Zhong Xiaoying was at home, although her family was in decline, they did not have the hygienic habits of the Yuanlao—bathing and changing clothes every day—but they used water every day. In the summer, they would take a shower every three or four days, and less in the winter, but they would still bathe once a month. She had never heard of not bathing for several months and just changing clothes.

Zhong Xiaoying was very puzzled, "Aren't there very good bathrooms in the trading post? Hot and cold water are so convenient."

"My clothes are very neat, and my face, hands, and feet are very clean. Isn't that enough?" Kretia said. "Besides, the priests and doctors all say that frequent bathing can cause various diseases."

Hearing this, Zhong Xiaoying became anxious and immediately began to lecture her on the principles of "hygiene," talking at length about the "significance of keeping clean for women's physiological health." Although Kretia didn't understand most of it, she got the general idea: her new friend wanted her to take a bath.

"But I can't bathe these few days," Kretia said hesitantly.

"Why?"

"Because..." Kretia's face turned a little red, and she was reluctant to continue. Zhong Xiaoying suddenly understood. No wonder Kretia's behavior had been particularly "demure" these few days.

"So that's it," she also blushed a little. "You can take a shower." Then she got off the bed again and took out a paper box from her suitcase.

The paper box was sealed, with a line of words printed on it: "Women's Health Care Set A," and below it, in a smaller font: "Ministry of Health, General Factory of Medical and Health Materials." This was followed by the year, month, and day in Arabic numerals.

The box contained women's hygiene products that the Ministry of Health had recently started to mass-produce: sanitized toilet paper and cotton gauze sanitary napkins. A bar of sanitized soap was also included in the box.

"This is another gift for you," Zhong Xiaoying said a little embarrassedly.
