Who could be looking for me now? Yang Xinwu muttered as he opened the door.

Standing outside was a young woman dressed in a black dress, with a white collar and cuffs, white knee-high socks, a white apron, and black cloth shoes—the attire of a "life secretary."

Transmigrator Yang's eyes fell on the pair of magnificent breasts, and he couldn't help but swallow.

"Are you Chief Yang Xinwu?" the visitor said timidly. "I am the new temporary life secretary. The General Office has assigned me here. This is the dispatch order..."

"Come in first." Yang Xinwu had originally intended to "sternly refuse." He was well aware of [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s considerate purpose, but the messy state of his home and the annoyance of eating takeout every day for the past few days made it impossible for him to push the other party out the door. "What's your name?"

"My name is Yang Min," the maid said with a sweet smile, and her two large weapons swayed accordingly. Transmigrator Yang quickly averted his gaze: it would be good to clean up and cook first, he thought.

The new maid was both diligent and capable. Yang Xinwu went for a walk, and when he returned, his home was already neat and tidy, and the aroma of food was wafting from the kitchen for the first time in a long while. Transmigrator Yang took a greedy breath and found that he actually had an appetite.

The food was exceptionally good, especially since there was beef, which was rationed even for transmigrators. [Xiao Zishan][y001] had really spared no expense. Although Yang Xinwu considered himself to have seen through the other's tricks, the hot and fragrant braised beef still made him feel comfortable all over. Especially this new Yang Min, not only was her cup size no less than Yang Jihong's, but her appearance and figure were far superior. In his heart, Yang Jihong's appearance immediately faded a few more shades.

Yang Min had been languishing at the maid school for a term and was anxious. This time, by a very rare chance, she had been directly assigned by the General Office. Although the dispatch order was for "short-term service," a clerk from the General Office had already given her instructions before she left, telling her to "not miss this heaven-sent opportunity."

As long as the Chief spoke, "short-term service" could become "permanent." She understood this much. If she missed this opportunity and was sent back to the school, not only would she likely never have the chance to serve a transmigrator personally again, but she would also become the "laughingstock" of the entire school.

Yang Min was now using all the skills she had learned from the maid school to serve him. The General Office had also specially sent "special supply" ingredients to let her show off her skills.

Four dishes and one soup with two desserts, a combination of land and sea, sweet and savory, crispy, soft, fresh, and fragrant. Her skills were a level higher than Yang Jihong's. The longer "pending assignment" time also meant longer training and practice time, which was not comparable to the first batch of students who were assigned after only a few months of hasty training.

"Chief, would you like some wine?"

"No, I drank too much at noon." Yang Xinwu was very comfortable being served by her and was in a good mood. Seeing her still busy serving him, he said, "You should eat too."

"No, I'll just eat a little after the Chief has finished. Chief Dong said that to maintain a good figure, one should eat less for dinner," she said with a charming smile.

"Haha, you're listening to Dong Weiwei's nonsense. You won't be over-nourished..." As he spoke, his eyes involuntarily fell on the pair of peaks that were straining against Yang Min's clothes.

Yang Min felt his burning gaze and was secretly pleased, but she pretended to be shy and lowered her head: "The Chief is right." She deliberately changed the subject. "This is medicinal wine made by Runshitang. The recipe was personally prescribed by Chief Liu. It's specially supplied by the General Office for the Chiefs. It's the most nourishing and strengthening..." As she spoke, she looked at Yang Xinwu with eager eyes.

Unable to resist her expectant gaze and the "surging waves," Transmigrator Yang still drank a small cup. The wine was mellow and not spicy. After drinking it, he only felt a warmth rising from his dantian and circulating throughout his body. His limbs and bones all felt relaxed and comfortable.

"Is the wine to your liking, Chief?"

"Good, good. Liu San has a good hand."

"Tell me about it. We often drink the soups he prepares at school. I'll go get a dish..." As she spoke, she turned and went out. Transmigrator Yang's eyes fell on her hips, which were wrapped in a black skirt and swaying. They were surprisingly full.

A moment later, Yang Min came out of the kitchen with a plate with a warming cover on it.

When the cover was lifted, it was a plate of grilled oysters—fresh oysters that had just been harvested that afternoon. The milky aroma of the sea immediately filled the air.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] had noticed that Yang Xinwu's complexion had improved significantly in the past few days. He spent much less time at the teahouse, and his expression was much more lively than before. He couldn't help but be secretly surprised, wondering what kind of psychological treatment [Xiao Zishan][y001] had used.

However, the next day, a maid with an unfamiliar face came to buy things with a secondary card signed by Yang Xinwu, and he suddenly understood. Chu Qing even poked [Wu Nanhai][y009] and whispered, "So big."

"Truly, as soon as the old one cries, the new one laughs," [Wu Nanhai][y009] shook his head. Although he looked indifferent to this matter, he was actually playing his own little game in his heart. Before the Lin Xiaoya case was officially reported in the newspapers, it had already been reported in the *Weekly News*, which was only for transmigrators and high-level naturalized citizens. The level of detail was far greater than the mere thousand-word press release. [Wu Nanhai][y009] had not paid much attention to it at first, but the secret activities of various people at the teahouse quickly made him realize that this case was unusual. [Wu Nanhai][y009] then found that issue of the *Lingao Times* and the *Weekly News* and read them carefully several times, and combined with what he had seen and heard these days, he knew that although the case was small, it was a case of seeing the big from the small, and there were not a few people who wanted to make an issue of this case.

That night, before going to bed, [Wu Nanhai][y009] carefully considered the cause and effect. For this, he even specially studied the drafts of several laws sent by the Arbitration Tribunal for the review of the transmigrators, and felt that he could also get involved in this matter.

Obviously, no matter how much novelty Transmigrator Yang currently felt for the newcomer, Yang Jihong's first-mover advantage was very obvious. As the saying goes, first impressions are the most lasting. The naturalized citizens who came to Lingao during the "difficult march" of the Senate, whether voluntarily or forced, were all "old" in the eyes of the transmigrators, and their status was completely different from the later "new" ones. Yang Jihong was not only a first-batch student of the maid school, but she was also pregnant. Although the Senate had not issued detailed regulations on the inheritance of the transmigrators, since ancient times, the eldest son was the most valued. Although Yang Jihong's child could not be the eldest son of the legal wife, as Yang Xinwu's firstborn, his status was naturally different.

Whether out of emotion or for the sake of face, Yang Xinwu would not easily abandon Yang Jihong. Helping out in this matter would surely win him great favor from Transmigrator Yang.

Transmigrator Yang was roughly a "soy sauce transmigrator" with no faction, and he usually did not participate in social activities of groups like the Zhai Party, which claimed to be the "representative of the soy sauce transmigrators." If he could be pulled over to become his basic support, it would be of great benefit to his future political calculations.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] was no longer interested in simple "popularity." The rise of the Zhai Party and the election of Qian Shuiting had disrupted his plan to quietly cultivate his reputation and then enter the Executive Committee through the position of the Speaker of the Senate.

If he wanted to enter the Executive Committee before the next election, he had to establish his own political base as soon as possible. In his opinion, Transmigrator Yang was a very suitable person: he was from the education sector and had a say in matters up and down the education sector; he had previously worked in the financial industry and had obvious intersections with the "Wudaokou" faction. Finally, with his advantage of teaching at Fangcaodi, in ten or twenty years, his students would be all over the world, which was also a political resource.

Helping out would not harm him at all, nor would it require much effort. Whether it succeeded or not, Transmigrator Yang would be grateful for his righteousness. And among the broad masses of transmigrators, he could also establish his image of "benevolence." Compared to the current Executive Committee, where either iron and blood prevailed or democracy ran rampant, or there were Darwinian socialists, the "benevolence" aspect was almost blank. "The way of governing is to be both strict and lenient." At present, the Senate was in its initial stage, and its governance was strict and harsh. In the future, it would inevitably take the "lenient" route.

However, how to help? He himself could not be the one to stick his neck out, as that would be too conspicuous. [Wu Nanhai][y009] decided to find someone to stand at the forefront and wave the flag, while he played the role of the main supporter. In this way, he could both show his actions and not attract the attention of certain people.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] considered for a few days and decided to find Ji Xin to be this person who sticks his neck out. First, he had already clearly taken the lead in "protecting the rights and interests of the natives," so he didn't mind doing it again, and it was justified. Second, like Yang Xinwu, he also worked in the education sector and had a natural commonality, so it was reasonable for him to speak out.

Since Ji Xin had started a "Native Rights Protection Association," he had long been a "one-man association." If it weren't for Panpan's sympathy for his ideas and her persuasion of Ding Ding to let him regularly publish some theoretical articles in the *Enlightenment Star*, he would have had almost no sense of existence. Over time, he became a "forgotten person," working as a teacher at Fangcaodi. In his spare time, his main activity was to attend meetings of the Law Society and also participate in the compilation of some laws and regulations. Therefore, he could often be seen at the Farm Café.

That night, [Wu Nanhai][y009] saw that the Law Society had adjourned and Ji Xin had not yet left. He invited him to a private room to "talk."

"What can I do for you?" Ji Xin was not familiar with [Wu Nanhai][y009]—he had almost no contact with people from the agricultural sector.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] nodded, let the waitress who brought the tea leave, and closed the door.

"I want to talk about Yang Xinwu's matter, or rather, that case of Yang Jihong."

Ji Xin nodded, without showing much surprise: "There's nothing difficult about this case itself."

"Of course, of course. In terms of the case itself, there's really nothing to talk about. But don't you think the subsequent legal issues are worth considering?"

Although Ji Xin was a bit idealistic, he had been in society for more than ten years before. Hearing this, he immediately became cautious.
