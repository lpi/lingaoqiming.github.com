"Building B?" Liu Zheng was confused. The camp, he imagined, would be a collection of tents, not a complex of numbered buildings. But a brightly lit road separated two distinct areas: Building A for the single men, and Building B for the couples and families.

"Not bad," he thought. "They've considered everything." But a strange odor, a mixture of pesticide and burning mugwort, hung heavy in the air. "No Smoking" signs were posted everywhere. The carton of 555 cigarettes in his backpack suddenly felt a thousand miles away.

He had come prepared. His bag was filled with camping gear and military rations from around the world. He had little faith in the Executive Committee's logistical prowess. Public canteens, in his experience, were a recipe for inefficiency and bad taste. He had even fashioned a net from vines and caught a pound of shrimp and a crab in the mangrove forest, a feast he planned to share with his wife.

As he walked, he saw Ran Yao and a squad of military police approaching, a man with a black plastic bag over his head in their custody.

"Night inspection," Ran Yao said, his voice flat. "ID card."

Liu Zheng complied. The scanner on Ran Yao's PDA confirmed his identity.

"Did you bring foreign military rations?"

"Yes." Liu Zheng's hand instinctively went to his backpack.

Ran Yao produced a handful of brown plastic bags and a carton of 555s. Liu Zheng recognized them instantly. "My cigarettes!"

"We found these on this man," Ran Yao said, gesturing to the hooded figure. "He was just leaving your tent."

Liu Zheng was stunned. A thief, on the first day of their new world. The ugliness of human nature, it seemed, had transmigrated with them.

"We didn't expect it either," Ran Yao said. "We thought the patrols were overkill. But here we are."

He watched as they led the man away, a strange pity welling in his chest. To be branded a criminal at the very beginning... it was a tragic start to a new life.

Ran Yao brought the man to the command post. A body search had revealed a Type 64 pistol, a genuine military-issue weapon. It was a strange choice for a criminal. The man wore the standard transmigrator uniform and a basic laborer's armband, but he had no electronic dog tag.

When they removed the hood, the mystery deepened. The man was young, with sharp, experienced eyes. Ran Yao, a former police officer, recognized the look. This was a colleague.

"Name, age, occupation?" Ran Yao asked.

The man remained silent, his face a mask of profound confusion. Finally, he spoke. "Who are you?"

Ran Yao was taken aback. "I am Ran Yao, leader of the Public Security Group."

"Public Security Group of where?" Guo Yi asked. The man interrogating him was a cop, he was sure of it. But why was he wearing the uniform of the Transmigration Company? How had he gotten on the ship?

The questions piled up, a mountain of absurdity. He and the two American agents had tracked the ship to the port, their minds filled with visions of a vast criminal conspiracy. They had sneaked aboard, hiding among the cargo, their presence known only to the ship's senior crew.

The rendezvous with the sailboat, the sudden loss of all communication, the arrival in this strange, desolate harbor... it had all been a prelude to this moment, this bizarre interrogation in a makeshift command post.

"Executive Committee, Internal and Civil Affairs Committee, Public Security Group," Ran Yao recited. "Any problem?"

Guo Yi stared at him, uncomprehending. This was no ordinary criminal gang. They were organized, well-equipped, and ruthless. He had seen the professionals at work, the military discipline, the sheer scale of their operation. He had fallen into the hands of a powerful, shadowy organization, and he was sure he would be tortured and killed. He steeled himself, his mind a mantra of defiance. *Do not yield.*

Ran Yao sighed. The man was clearly terrified, but he was also resolute. Torture was out of the question. But how to explain? He had spent the afternoon trying to explain their situation to the family they had accidentally brought with them, and had been met with a stream of curses and accusations of insanity. This, he suspected, would be no different.
