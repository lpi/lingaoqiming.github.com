Just as the various specialized groups of the Executive Committee were arguing over priority for labor allocation, [Xiao Zishan][y001] received another call from Ran Yao: they had discovered Li tribesmen among the captives during interrogation.

"Really?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] was startled. On Hainan Island, the Li people had always been a formidable force. A look through the county gazettes showed that the "Li Situation" always warranted its own section. Since the Yuan Dynasty, there was hardly a year without a Li uprising. The conflict between the Han and the Li was intense, and defending against the Li was a major task for the local government. Due to their resistance, Han Chinese immigrants had never managed to penetrate the island's core. For the transmigrators to grow and thrive in Hainan, they had to be extremely cautious in their dealings with the Li.

"What's the situation?"

"They say they were conscripted by the county as crossbowmen. Thirty of them came, and we've captured eight," Ran Yao said over the phone. "Also, let me tell you something else. Remember that family that got accidentally involved?"

"I remember. The woman was a former police officer, right? I sent her to you for interrogations."

"She's Li, and her ancestral home is Hainan. Pretty neat, huh? I think we can use this connection."

"I remember her having a Sichuan accent. A lot of ethnic minorities these days are 'ethnic' in name only. Besides, she hasn't lived there for a long time, what could she possibly know?"

"No, she knows a lot about her people. A few of the Li captives are completely in awe of her," Ran Yao's laughter came through the PHS phone. "See? Talent sometimes pops up when you least expect it."

Meanwhile, Guo Yi had nearly finished screening the captives. The vast majority were farmers—even small landowners often worked the fields themselves. A few were artisans, but they were really just part-time farmers, firing some pottery or working as masons during the off-season. The only one with any real skill was a rough carpenter, a man past his middle age. Only one person was literate: Zhang Xingjiao. He was singled out to learn Mandarin from Xiong Buyou and was made the clerk for the entire labor force, responsible for recording work points and other administrative tasks.

Wu De separated the artisans into their own team. The rest, aside from about twenty wounded, were divided into five labor teams, led by the first five captives. During the organization, based on the interrogation records, he deliberately mixed the Lingao natives, the Fujianese "slash-and-burn" farmers, and immigrants from other regions. He was still using his old divide-and-conquer strategy—anything to prevent them from uniting. Lin Xing and the other new team leaders, having forgotten their own half-captive, half-slave status, were quite pleased with their promotion. Without waiting for orders, they had already made themselves whips, eager to supervise the new wretches.

Strict hierarchy, absolute power between superiors and subordinates, and the benefits derived from that power—these are incredibly seductive forces in any human group. Having worked in the military and judiciary for many years, Wu De understood this well. He deliberately reinforced this structure. Each of the five team leaders was issued an ugly, rattan safety helmet—a failed prototype from the Industrial Committee, originally destined for the firewood pile. Wu De had salvaged them, using the clear visual distinction of "hatted" and "unhatted" to delineate the captives' status.

Due to the urgent construction needs, all labor teams were assigned to the construction group to produce the most basic building material: bricks.

While modern construction was moving towards reinforced concrete, fired clay bricks remained one of the most common and economical materials, and the construction group had no intention of abandoning them.

The reconnaissance team had located a brick and tile works three kilometers from Bairen Beach. It was a typical traditional operation with three earthen round kilns. Though the workers had fled, everything else was left behind: fired bricks and tiles, air-dried green bricks, and a large quantity of "prepared clay."

The process of firing bricks was tedious. First, raw clay (clay without organic matter) had to be extracted. It was then sun-dried, crushed, mixed with water, and repeatedly trampled to create "prepared clay," which was then molded into green bricks. These green bricks couldn't be fired immediately; too much moisture would cause them to crack and warp in the kiln. They needed to be air-dried for ten to fifteen days, sheltered from sun, strong wind, and cold. This meant that, traditionally, bricks couldn't be fired in winter. Only after proper drying could they be placed in the kiln.

If the transmigrators had to make and fire bricks by traditional methods, the efficiency would be abysmal. Fortunately, they had a combined brick-making machine powered by a portable steam engine. With this, their brick production rate was limited only by how much raw clay they could excavate.

Mei Wan considered the earthen kilns too inefficient. Moreover, loading a kiln was a skilled job, not something novices like them, working from a manual, could manage. Luckily, there was a large supply of ready-made bricks on site. They decided to use them to build a 16-chamber Hoffman kiln.

The Hoffman kiln was a "foreign" design. While primitive compared to modern tunnel kilns, in this time and place, it was a technological marvel.

It was a continuous production kiln, allowing for loading, firing, cooling, and unloading to happen simultaneously. The kiln consisted of a series of interconnected chambers forming a circular tunnel, with numerous doors along the perimeter. All flues connected to a central chimney, and fuel was added through ports in the roof. The process was divided into four zones: drying, preheating, firing, and cooling. In a 16-chamber kiln, as one chamber was being unloaded, another was being cleaned, and another was being loaded. Once lit, it could operate 24/7, offering efficiency and heat utilization far beyond traditional kilns. A standard Hoffman kiln could produce over fifty million bricks and tiles a year.

To save time, while the machinery was being installed and the Hoffman kiln was being built, Mei Wan decided to fire the existing air-dried green bricks. However, loading the earthen kiln was a specialized skill that neither the transmigrators nor the laborers possessed. When word reached the Executive Committee, [Luo Duo][y011] of the Intelligence and Information Group once again proved his worth as a walking encyclopedia. He quickly located a digital copy of a 1958 booklet titled "Earthen Methods for Making Bricks and Tiles" on a hard drive. Within an hour, a printed copy was rushed to the kiln site. The laborers were astonished to see this "pirate artisan" directing them on how to load the kiln using a book—a secret previously known only to master craftsmen!

Near the kiln was a large field of thatch. After questioning some laborers who had done odd jobs there, Mei Wan learned it was intentionally grown as fuel. Earthen kilns required "soft firewood" like this to burn properly; hardwood burned too intensely, making the fire difficult to control. Naturally, the transmigrators put this fuel to good use.

While the earthen kiln was firing, Mei Wan directed the labor teams to cut grass and dig clay, creating massive piles of both. Some captives began to despair, thinking the pirates meant to work them to death—there was so much clay, they couldn't possibly use it all, even if they worked without rest.

Then, the portable steam engine sputtered to life, belching black smoke. The flywheel began to turn, powering the combined brick-making machine. The captives watched, mesmerized, as piles of prepared clay were fed into the machine's great steel maw. A dazzling array of iron parts whirred and roared, and then, as if by magic, smooth, uniform green bricks emerged, neatly cut into boards! Not even the most skilled brick-maker could work this fast. Everyone was dumbfounded. The pirates could do anything! The speed at which they created things was beyond mortal comprehension. Some of the captives, terrified, fell to their knees and kowtowed before the roaring machine.

"What are you bowing for? Get back to moving materials!" Mei Wan yelled at a stunned Lin Xing.

"Yes, Chief!" Lin Xing replied. He had picked up the title from some bored transmigrator and now used it for all of them.

"Work! Work!" he shouted, brandishing his stick. "Move the clay! Hurry up! Anyone who's too slow gets thrown into that iron mouth!"

The threat was far more effective than his stick. A superstitious terror of the machine gripped every captive. They worked with frantic energy, terrified of being fed to the machine as a living sacrifice.

The newly made green bricks were carted to a stacking area. The original drying sheds had been cleared out and were now used to store the machine-made bricks, all produced to the old "85 brick" standard.

The machine's productivity was far beyond anything this era had ever seen. Before evening, the entire supply of prepared clay, which would have lasted the Lingao brick-makers for months, was exhausted. The machine fell silent.

To build the Hoffman kiln, Mei Wan had another crucial task: producing cement. Back in his own time, getting cement was as simple as making a phone call. Even the cement they'd used since D-Day had been brought with them. Now, faced with making it from scratch, he was completely lost. He knew of something called "earthen cement," but he had no idea how to make it or what its properties would be.

In modern society, cement production is a highly specialized, mechanized industry involving massive, dedicated equipment like crushers, rotary kilns, and ball mills. Replicating such machinery was a luxury the transmigrators couldn't afford. Even if they had the equipment, they lacked the capacity to install and operate such behemoths.
