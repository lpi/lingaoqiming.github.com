[Wen Desi][y002] briefly described his experience of crossing over alone. The other side of the wormhole from his bathroom was at the foot of a hill, by a small river. Judging from the level of land development, it was a fairly prosperous agricultural area. The landforms and vegetation suggested it was Southern China. Just as he was hesitating whether to venture deeper to see if there were any villages to investigate, the unexpected happened:

A group of soldiers in ancient costumes, led by a mounted officer, escorted more than a dozen people who looked like villagers to the riverbank and immediately began a massacre.

Although [Wen Desi][y002] had seen some rather bloody photos on the internet, watching it happen in real life from less than thirty meters away was an unparalleled shock.

Finally, the soldiers cut off the heads, casually tossed some broken weapons around the corpses, and then rode off, surrounding their officer.

"...Fortunately, I was wearing camouflage, otherwise it would have been really dangerous." [Wen Desi][y002] still had lingering fears as he spoke. "The closest ones were less than ten meters away from me."

The first impression the other spacetime left on [Wen Desi][y002] was that the air was good. The second impression was that his life was in peril.

[Wen Desi][y002] opened his laptop and showed them the photos taken on site. The bloody, headless corpses, rendered by the 9-megapixel DSLR lens, were so realistic they made one want to vomit.

"I also found some copper coins scattered around." [Wen Desi][y002] took out a plastic bag containing a dozen or so copper coins. "There are several kinds. I had someone look at them. The latest one is a Tianqi Tongbao."

"It could also be from the Chongzhen era."

"It's at least after the second year of Tianqi," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with confidence. "The Guangzong Emperor was on the throne for only a few months before he died. In the first year of Tianqi, they were minting his father's Taichang Tongbao. They only started minting coins with the Tianqi reign title in the second year. If you consider that minting and circulation also take time, you can estimate it to be after the third year of Tianqi."

"But that's still a rather broad estimate for the era. Those two brothers were on the throne for more than twenty years."

"I think it should be the Tianqi era, or at most the early Chongzhen era. Chongzhen Tongbao coins were minted in large quantities all over the country and had a wide circulation. It's impossible that there would only be Tianqi coins."

Now that the era was determined, what did they intend to do?

A wormhole to another spacetime was a milestone for the scientific community, but the three men in the bathroom were clearly not physicists; a Nobel Prize was out of the question. If it were to be major news, none of them were in the media industry; at most, they would be the subjects of the news. Of course, as the discoverer, [Chief Wen][y002] would surely be mentioned briefly in the news. Beyond that, these men, all being quite conspiratorially minded, thought that given the potentially huge consequences, the existence of the wormhole would most likely be completely covered up—just as Americans have always suspected about Area 51. In that case, their prospects would be very bleak.

Besides the owner of the wormhole—unclaimed property belongs to the discoverer, so [Wen Desi][y002] could be considered the owner of the wormhole—the other two men understood very well that this was an opportunity. If [Wen Desi][y002] had really wanted to win some physics prize or pursue his "solo, two-way, low-profile transmigration," he would never have made that post.

How big was this opportunity? As [Chief Wen][y002] said, it was big enough to potentially own a world—the 17th century on another plane of existence.

At this thought, their breathing grew heavy.

After a brief discussion, in the bathroom of [Wen Desi][y002]'s home, the initial Executive Committee was formed, and its first document was immediately produced. In the history of the discovery of the new century, this meeting was known as the "Bathroom Meeting."

The program passed by the meeting: Establish a new world!

How to create their new world? The ancients were not mindless NPCs. In terms of intelligence, they were not inferior to modern people. They lacked neither courage nor strength, and when it came to adapting to the environment, they were far superior to the delicate people of modern times. Although these three men all loved to read transmigration and alternate history novels, they at least knew they didn't possess any kind of protagonist aura.

The only thing the transmigrators could surpass them in was the accumulation of 300 more years of civilization.

"Scale and standardization," said [Wang Luobin][y003], "are the magic weapons for victory. An industrialized society is enough to defeat any ancient society."

The plan was to gather a large number of transmigrators who had mastered modern technology and management methods, carry modern industrial equipment and technology, and travel together to that spacetime. They would establish a base, complete basic industrialization, form a complete industrial system, and use this as a starting point to dominate the globe.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. No matter how grand this goal was, they still had to eat one bite at a time. After discussion, the group determined two immediate goals:

Recruit more transmigrators and raise money to purchase materials and equipment.

[Wen Desi][y002] decided to first set up a Skype chat group for communication. The original post was already very popular. He made no further explanations, simply adding the group number and a backup email address. Then he locked the post—they all agreed that it was not advisable to attract attention from now on.

As for money, although the three of them had some savings, it added up to less than a million yuan. A million RMB to achieve industrialization—even the industrialization of the Industrial Revolution era—was too much of a fantasy.

Of course, in theory, subsequent participants would also bring funds, but it wouldn't be a huge amount.

Using the two-way transmigration to exploit the price differences between the two spacetimes was probably a more realistic way to make money quickly.

Using modern products to make huge profits in ancient times was a tried-and-true method of getting rich in all transmigration novels. They immediately thought of transmigration-specific treasures like glass mirrors, glass cups, matches, and watches. Countless transmigrator predecessors had relied on these to make their fortunes in other spacetimes, dig up their first pot of gold, and embark on their journey to hegemony.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] contributed the large quantity of promotional gifts he had accumulated over the years due to his penchant for petty gains:

Plastic powder boxes with mirrors, melamine bowls, spoons, and chopsticks, small fruit knives, plastic kitchen aprons, acrylic hat-scarf-glove sets, glass mugs, plastic lunch boxes, towels... all in all, three or four boxes full. These small commodities, custom-made in Yiwu, were ugly and printed with various company logos. But at this moment, in the eyes of these men, they were all shining gold.

In the 17th century, Venetian glass mirrors were a luxury even in Europe, and they didn't exist in Asia at all. From this point of view, mirrors were a monopoly. Then there were the unbreakable bowls and dishes, the transparent lunch boxes... including the empty bottles of purified water they had just drunk. Any of these were new things that didn't exist in that spacetime. In theory, they could sell them for any price they wanted: a hundred taels of silver for a powder box, two thousand taels for a cup, a hundred taels for a bowl... countless transmigration predecessors had done just that...

The three men were all flushed with excitement at the golden future. [Wen Desi][y002] even began to have some regrets—perhaps he could have unified the world by adventuring alone with two-way transmigration.

"But if we just go over like this, we'll be arrested as Japanese pirates at the city gate and taken to the coastal defense subprefect's yamen," [Wang Luobin][y003] thought of a practical problem.

"Is there a coastal defense subprefect's yamen in Guangzhou?"

"I don't know, but the Office of Maritime Trade should be there."

"That's true. Our clothes are strange, and our accents are weird. Guangzhou is not a sparsely populated place. And we don't have travel permits or passes..."

"We won't be exiled to Liaodong, will we?"

"That's unlikely, but if we get dragged to the yamen for a hearing because of our strange clothes and suspicious behavior, we'll be skinned alive even if we don't die." [Xiao Zishan][y001] remembered reading the memoirs of some Portuguese who came to China in the Ming Dynasty. An unlucky Portuguese pirate had recorded in detail the entire process after his capture. Although he greatly praised the Ming Dynasty's justice system, considering it a perfect system of fairness, impartiality, and openness, he also said without hesitation that it was cruel to the prisoners.

Thinking of the various tortures that Portuguese man had suffered and witnessed, [Xiao Zishan][y001] couldn't help but shiver, a sense of fear rising in his heart.

"How about we find some Hanfu websites? I've seen a few that are very meticulous in their research of Ming Dynasty clothing."

"The clothes might work, but we can't learn the mannerisms and behavior," [Wang Luobin][y003] objected. "That would be even more suspicious."

"What if we pose as foreign merchants—we could claim to be sea merchants from Borneo." [Wen Desi][y002] proposed a new idea. "Maybe we could pose as tribute envoys? Don't emperors all like to have all nations come to court?"

"The tribute trade stopped long ago. Besides, the court is probably overwhelmed with problems right now and has no interest." [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought for a moment. "I remember that the Ming Dynasty had very strict management of foreigners. Except for the Portuguese, foreign merchants could only trade in Macau, and their ships were not allowed to enter the Pearl River."

"The Portuguese can enter Guangzhou?"

"Yes, it seems that Guangzhou held a trade fair every year back then, and merchants from all over would bring their goods to trade with the Portuguese."

"So the Canton Fair has such a long history," [Wang Luobin][y003] exclaimed in admiration.

The Canton Fair, which was once China's main window for foreign trade, had its predecessor in the Ming Dynasty, but at that time it was only open to Portuguese merchants. It was held once each summer and winter at Haizhu Island, which is now the area of the Haizhu District General Labor Union.

"But none of us look like foreign friends. I wonder if there were any ethnic Chinese with foreign nationality back then?"

"Maybe there were, who knows."

"This is a headache. It seems we have to check the historical records."

Suddenly, [Xiao Zishan][y001] slapped the table and laughed:

"We're so stupid! Why are we always thinking about how to get *into* Guangzhou? We're already *in* Guangzhou!"

Everyone's eyes lit up. Indeed, since the entry and exit points of the wormhole were the same in both spacetimes, as long as they crossed over within the boundaries of the Ming Dynasty city of Guangzhou, wouldn't they enter Guangzhou city directly? And if any crisis really occurred, they could just open the wormhole and escape back.

The chosen crossing point was Haopan Street, which was originally in the riverside area south of Guangzhou city. This place was already a prosperous commercial area as early as the Southern Song Dynasty. In the early Ming Dynasty, its commerce became even more prosperous. During the Jiajing reign, a new city was built, and this commercial area by the Pearl River was also included. From then on, the southern city wall of Guangzhou stood directly on the bank of the Pearl River.

In the Ming Dynasty, Haopan Street was the so-called gathering place for wealthy merchants from other provinces, and it was actually also a concentration point for smugglers. These people colluded with the fishermen on Youyu Island at the mouth of the Pearl River, specializing in trafficking goods from "foreign ships," engaging in the business of smuggling. "Every time a foreign ship arrived, they would collude with the wealthy merchants from other provinces on Haopan Street to move porcelain, silk floss, private money, and gunpowder, leaving fully loaded and returning fully loaded." [Xiao Zishan][y001] strongly suspected that these so-called "wealthy merchants from other provinces" were all figures with official backgrounds, which was why smuggling could be so rampant.

Since they were all smugglers, they certainly wouldn't care where they came from. Profit is the nature of a merchant. From this point of view, the merchants of Haopan Street seemed to be the most suitable people to contact.
