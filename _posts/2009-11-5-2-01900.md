Guo Yi received a tetanus shot and a few stitches on his head at the infirmary. He Ma originally wanted to give him an IV drip with some antibiotics to prevent inflammation, but then he thought that the current antibiotics were a one-way street, and the bacteria of the Ming Dynasty had no drug resistance, so he stingily only gave him some pills. Guo Yi went out for some fresh air and saw Xue Ziliang, whose wounds had been treated, sitting on a rock outside the infirmary tent, smoking with his head down. This person had just been driven back from the pier—Salina had been transferred to the infirmary on the ship—her condition was more serious. Xue Ziliang wanted to go with her but was refused. No matter how he jumped and shouted on the pier, Ye Mengyan, who was on guard, would not let him get on the transport boat.

"I am her colleague, I have the right to know! I protest!"

"I also strongly protest, plus express deep regret." Ye Mengyan's pimples turned red. "No boarding, this is the rule."

Xue Ziliang held it in for a long time and then blurted out, "I want to see your leader!"

"The leader is busy, in a meeting to study problems." Ye Mengyan muttered, "You should go back to the infirmary. I advise you not to go further and further down the wrong path."

Xue Ziliang looked at the "little soldier" whose posture was full of flaws and who couldn't even hold a gun properly. *I could take you down in three seconds!* he thought angrily. But although he was a bit arrogant, he was not stupid. He knew that if he made a scene, no one here would take care of the "American friend." Seeing the transport boat getting farther and farther away, and having nowhere to go for the time being, he had to go back to the infirmary and squat in a corner to wait for Guo Yi to come out—he was the only acquaintance he had left now.

"Guo, what do you think we should do?" the ABC said with a helpless look on his face. "I never thought I would be a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court!"

[Note: A work by Mark Twain, in which an American travels back to medieval England and defeats the medieval English knights with barbed wire, machine guns, and poison gas. It may be the originator of modern transmigration novels.]

"Just accept your fate." Although Guo Yi himself had not recovered from this huge change, he still felt a little malicious pleasure seeing Xue Weini's dejected look. Suddenly, he felt that this was inappropriate, as it seemed to be cursing Salina to her doom—after all, Salina was closer to Xue.

As for himself, when the suture needle pierced his flesh, his soul was considering what to do in the future. As a qualified civil servant, Little Guo certainly knew that he had to actively get close to the organization at all times to have personal development.

Speaking of the leaders of the Transmigration Company, Little Guo had prepared materials for all of them. The big BOSS was [Wen Desi][y002], one was an engineer in an enterprise, [Wang Luobin][y003], and there was also [Xiao Zishan][y001]—an unemployed sales manager...

In the past, Little Guo could summon these people for a "cup of tea" with a single phone call, and if he said 8 o'clock, they wouldn't dare to arrive at 8:01. Now, he knew without even thinking that he couldn't even get a meeting with them, let alone call them—they were definitely at the level of the Politburo Standing Committee now. What a bunch of monkeys in crowns.

Guo Yi thought for a long time and decided to go to Ran Yao first. At least he was an acquaintance. And he was the "security team leader," obviously a leader. He himself was from the police system, so he would definitely be a professional match there. He didn't know how to find him, so he just wandered around the camp. Sure enough, he found him without much trouble—after asking a few people, he was taken to the security team by the highly vigilant masses because he didn't have an armband, and was sent directly to Ran Yao.

The security team's office was in a newly erected tent. These official tents were all next to the power distribution station, surrounding the power distribution room outside the inspection department gate, inadvertently forming an administrative area. The security team's tent was on the outermost side. At the entrance sat a person with a "security" armband on his sleeve. He had a Type 54-style imitation cowhide concrete paper holster on one side of his waist and a baton on the other. At his feet were a Type 80 helmet and a riot shield.

Ran Yao was writing something behind a desk. He didn't look surprised when he saw Guo Yi come in.

"Have a seat."

Guo Yi looked around the small tent. Inside, besides a few computers, there were walkie-talkies being charged, and a few wooden boxes of ammunition marked in English were stacked on the side.

"Why did you come by yourself?" Ran Yao took a card from the table and gave it to him. "I was going to send someone to deliver your ID card. It's very troublesome to be in the camp without an ID. You can't even eat."

"Um, thank you." The card in his hand was just like a normal employee ID badge. It had his photo on it, and besides personal information like his name, there was also a printed barcode. His number was: Lin 0001.

Number 0001... Guo Yi had a wry smile on his face. He thought that "Lin" probably meant "temporary." Obviously, he had not been fully accepted by this group that he had called "bandits" just a few hours ago. Although this was expected, he still felt quite disappointed. For a moment, he didn't know how to start—his skin hadn't been thickened enough yet.

"Since this is another time and space, and we can't go back... I still hope to work for the organization and do what I can..." Guo Yi said hesitantly.

"Want to join the security team?" Ran Yao nodded.

"Yes, I think my major is a good fit for this." Guo Yi's speech became fluent. He then introduced his education and work experience. The more he spoke, the more confident he became. Ran Yao was probably from a criminal investigation background. As a dedicated national security officer, he was unique. The 21st century needed talent the most, and didn't the 17th century need talent even more...

"That's right," Ran Yao said in an appreciative tone. "A candidate like you is most welcome in our security team. However, I can't make the decision on your matter."

"I understand that," a trace of bitterness appeared in Guo Yi's words. "A department like the security team definitely needs to be tested." He suddenly stood up, saluted, and said loudly, "I am willing to accept any investigation from the organization!"

Ran Yao was startled by his action, thinking that this person might have been stimulated in some way. "Sit, sit, Comrade Little Guo, don't get excited."

Guo Yi's face was a little hot. He quickly sat down. "I'm sorry, I just..."

"It's okay, it's okay," Ran Yao took out a piece of paper. "According to the order of the Internal Affairs and Civil Affairs Committee, you are now assigned to the human resources team. Pay attention to the work order every morning that will tell you what your task is. Now, take this paper to the Planning Committee office to get your things."

He stood up, with a sincere smile on his face, and patted Little Guo on the shoulder. "Comrade Little Guo, I actually hope you can come to work here right away, but the system is the system. Before your status is regularized, you should first temper yourself in other positions—it's all for the revolution."

On the dirt road to survey point No. 4 of Bairen Tan, a Beijing 212 was speeding along. In the car were [Wang Luobin][y003], the executive committee member in charge of technology, and Mei Wan and [Li Xiaolü][y156] from the engineering and construction team.

The car was driving on a bumpy dirt road. This could hardly be called a road, but rather some sections of road suitable for off-road vehicles that the engineering team had temporarily marked out for the Bopu-Bairen Tan highway survey.

Since the highway survey began this morning, [Wang Luobin][y003] had run between these survey points several times, sometimes by car and sometimes on foot. In the plan, Bairen Tan would be the main production and living base for the transmigrators. This place was very favorable for the transmigrators: it was located next to the Wenlan River, the largest river in Lingao, which was convenient for industrial and domestic water supply and drainage; it was also the site of the Bairen Tan hydropower station in modern times. If a hydropower station could be built in the 20th century, it could also be built in the 17th century. Building the base next to the hydropower station would be beneficial for using electricity nearby, saving a lot of materials for laying lines and the protection costs after completion; Bairen Tan was 8 kilometers from Bopu Port and 4 kilometers from Lingao County. They could support each other. The three bases were arranged in a line along the Wenlan River, which was conducive to controlling the agricultural areas on both sides of the river.

To develop the base at Bairen Tan, a large amount of equipment and materials had to be transported to the construction site. The Bopu-Bairen Tan simple highway was thus listed as the highest priority project.

The car was very bumpy. [Wang Luobin][y003] looked at the scenery outside the window, listening to the whistling wind, and felt quite emotional. He had been running on the line all day today. In fact, he didn't know much about surveying or road construction, but he had a good idea of the difficulty of this project. The construction engineering team had gathered all the technical personnel in surveying, planning, and construction engineering among the transmigrators. Everyone had their own expertise and was at ease in a society with a high degree of division of labor, but it was not so good in a place that required all-rounders. Today's discussion on surveying and highway design had already exposed many problems, but the transmigrators needed this highway. As the head of the Industry, Communications, Energy, and Transportation Committee, he had to coordinate the first project under his command, and at the same time, train this team. The Executive Committee needed construction talent. The more he thought about it, the more excited he became, and he jotted down the problems he thought of in a small notebook from time to time.

[Wang Luobin][y003] turned to look at [Li Xiaolü][y156]. She had turned up her collar and was shrinking her head, as if she was dozing off. He smiled slightly, feeling that this woman was a little listless. She rarely spoke at work, but the quality of her work was very high.

After a while, the car suddenly bumped, and [Li Xiaolü][y156] woke up.

Mei Wan, who was driving, slowed down the car, and the car became more stable. [Wang Luobin][y003] asked, "Engineer Li, what do you think of this highway after your preliminary survey?"

[Li Xiaolü][y156] said, "The whole road is not very difficult. There are slopes, but the slopes are small, and the ground is relatively flat. The main problem is that the maps we have are all modern. The field survey shows a big difference, so we can't do the route selection on the map."

Mei Wan interjected, "Now it's like changing the map first, and then marking the route."

"That's right," [Li Xiaolü][y156] said. "If the map is accurate, I can spend a few hours at night selecting the route on the map, and then lead people to select and mark the route on the ground during the day, and we can start construction."

Now the survey team, under her leadership, had only surveyed 3 kilometers. A professional survey team should have at least 7 people. The Executive Committee had assigned her 12 people, but most of them didn't know how to survey, so she had to teach them from scratch, how to set the line, how to hold the slope pole, how to read the level. The survey team became a teaching team. They didn't even finish 500 meters in the morning. In the afternoon, everyone became familiar with it, and the progress accelerated.
