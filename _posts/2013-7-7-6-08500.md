"It's good that you know," Wang Ruixiang said. "You've been a soldier of the Yuanlao Yuan for several years now. You should know that the Yuanlao Yuan values a clear distinction between right and wrong. You and your men have committed a serious breach of discipline, and this matter must be dealt with severely!"

"Yes, I'm a bastard!" Huang Xiong hung his head, not daring to speak.

Wang Ruixiang gave Huang Xiong a thorough tongue-lashing. Seeing that the man didn't dare to argue and his attitude was relatively proper, his anger subsided by half. Originally, this matter wasn't considered a huge deal. The Yuanlao Yuan generally didn't want to interfere in soldiers' affairs with women, as long as it was consensual. This was mainly because most Fubo Army officers and soldiers were unmarried, and in recent years, there had been almost no opportunity for them to be discharged. Long-term, near-celibate service was bound to cause sexual frustration.

The idea of establishing facilities like military brothels had been discussed in small circles within the Yuanlao Yuan several times, but it was never put on the official agenda due to strong opposition from many Elders. However, the army's needs in this area couldn't be ignored forever. They had to be given an outlet for their desires.

This incident was less about being angry at them for sleeping with women and more about being furious that they were doing so without regard for priorities while on active duty in the field. This was not only a disregard for discipline but also a very dangerous sign of negligence. Openly keeping women who had not undergone purification or political screening, allowing them access to crucial military areas like the command post, could easily lead to security leaks. A woman with ulterior motives could easily gather a lot of intelligence. To put it in the most serious terms, it could even lead to the assassination of an officer, the theft of a pistol, and then the assassination of an Elder.

Wang Ruixiang said slowly, "I know your life here in this icy wilderness is hard. Never mind the common soldiers, you're in your thirties and an officer, yet you don't even have a family."

Huang Xiong had expected Elder Wang's next words to be: "Take him out and shoot him!" He was surprised that the Elder first mentioned his hardships. Amidst his fear, he couldn't help but feel moved. His eyes grew warm, and his nose twitched a few times.

"However, discipline is discipline. As the commander of the detachment, you not only failed to stop your subordinates' serious breaches of discipline, but you also led them in sleeping with women!" Wang Ruixiang's tone shifted back to the theme of "breach of discipline." "What else do you have to say for yourself?!"

"Reporting to you, sir: Nothing!" Huang Xiong stood ramrod straight, speaking fearfully.

"Tell me honestly: did you misappropriate or embezzle relief rations to spend on women?"

Huang Xiong quickly shook his head. "Reporting to you, sir, I, Huang Xiong, swear on my life, I did not!" He explained that the amount of relief gruel cooked each day was fixed, and he would never dare to misappropriate it privately.

"What about what you spent on the women? They didn't have a ration share to begin with. Stranded here, if you didn't take food from the mouths of the other refugees, what did you use to feed them?!"

"That..." Huang Xiong lowered his head. "At first, when we were... getting together, we did give them an extra half-bowl or bowl—that did happen. We all have a supplementary allowance of relief rations, and everyone used that to support the women. As for embezzlement, no one would dare. We all know the discipline..." He looked up with an expression of utmost sincerity. "If I, Huang Xiong, am telling a single lie, may I be struck by lightning!"

"No need for oaths. The men I brought will immediately take inventory and check the accounts. Have your quartermaster handle the handover at once!" Wang Ruixiang said. "As for your claim of using your own rations to support the women, we have ways to verify that too. You know best whether it's true or not."

Wang Ruixiang had his guards take over the warehouse and begin taking inventory and auditing the books. By evening, the results were in. The accounts and inventory matched. The suspicion of embezzling relief rations could be ruled out. However, the matter of misappropriating rations meant for the extra refugees couldn't be uncovered just by auditing the books. This would depend on further information from the members of the Ten-Man Group.

However, neither the Yuanlao Yuan nor the military intended to delve too deeply into the matter. The personal problems of Fubo Army officers and soldiers really needed to be put on the agenda; otherwise, similar incidents would continue to occur. The Elders' own selection and purchase of female servants was no secret in Lin'gao. The soldiers risked their lives but couldn't start families. Being overly strict on this matter could lead to disaffection.

As long as there was no embezzlement involved, using one's own rations to attract women was no more serious a problem than American and Soviet soldiers using military rations and nylon stockings to seduce German and Japanese women in World War II.

Now that no embezzlement of relief rations could be found, the severity of the problem was halved. However, necessary punishment was still required. Although privately keeping extra refugees wasn't as serious as "infringing on Yuanlao Yuan property," this was still a classic case of using public office for private gain.

"Bring your woman here," Wang Ruixiang said.

"Yes, sir!" Huang Xiong quickly ran out and returned shortly with a young woman. She was wearing an old Fubo Army winter uniform. Though it had many patches, it was neatly mended and clean. Wrapped around her thin frame, it made her look very small. Her delicate, pointed face gave Wang Ruixiang the illusion that she was just a little girl.

"To the Elder... kow..." Huang Xiong couldn't think of what kind of greeting to tell her to perform. The Elders didn't like kowtows. The woman, however, gracefully performed a curtsy.

"How old are you?"

"Replying to the Elder: this servant is sixteen." *She looks more like twelve!* Wang Ruixiang thought. But the girl spoke with a Shandong accent, which made him feel a sense of familiarity. He noticed her wrists and fingers were slender, and her skin was fair and delicate, clearly not the daughter of a poor family. Then he saw her bound feet and understood.

"You're the daughter of a grain-providing household, aren't you?"

"Yes, yes," Huang Xiong clumsily interjected. He saw that Wang Ruixiang had noticed the woman's bound feet and knew the Elders abhorred this. He quickly explained, "We were going to unbind her feet, but she can't walk if we do..."

Wang Ruixiang ignored Huang Xiong and asked, "What is your name?"

"This servant is called Wang Bao'er."

"How did you end up here?"

"My family's home was flooded... then we were robbed by bandits. Our family had no choice but to flee. We heard there was a way to survive here, so we came..."

"Do you have any family left?"

"No more..." Tears welled up in the young woman's eyes. "On the road... they all... died..."

"You're the daughter of a grain household, so you can probably read."

"Yes, I studied with my father for a few years as a child."

"Oh, from a scholarly family then." A slight smile touched Wang Ruixiang's lips. "Did your father have an official rank?"

"I wouldn't dare claim that. My father only read a few books and knew a few characters." Although she spoke modestly, in this era, finishing the Thirteen Classics made one an intellectual. To say one had "read a few books" was no small claim.

"Are you truly willing to be with this Huang Xiong?"

"Of course, it is true." Wang Bao'er blinked a few times, forcing a smile. "To be with Officer Huang is already this servant's greatest fortune..."

Seeing her aggrieved expression, he knew she didn't really feel it was any "greatest fortune." How could a daughter from a respectable family like hers look up to a coarse soldier like Huang Xiong? It was just that in these chaotic times, a human life was as cheap as paper. As a weak woman, she was just going with the flow to find a way to survive.

But that was none of his business. On the bright side, this was a manifestation of the Yuanlao Yuan's superiority in breaking the old order and establishing a new society. *You feel aggrieved now,* he thought, *but when Huang Xiong rises in rank in the future, you'll realize how incredibly lucky you are.*

Wang Ruixiang said with a smile, "I can see you're a woman from a good family. You've kept this place neat and tidy. You'll surely be a good wife who can manage a household in the future. Huang Xiong, you're a lucky man."

Huang Xiong was overjoyed, knowing the Elder had approved of their relationship. He quickly stood at attention and saluted. "Thank you, sir, for your blessing!"

"Don't be so quick to thank me. You have committed a serious breach of discipline this time, and you will not escape the punishment you deserve! And your men will be punished as well!" Wang Ruixiang said sternly.

"Yes, sir!"

"Sound the bugle, assemble the troops!"

"Yes, sir!" Huang Xiong saluted and ran out.

The detachment assembled quickly. Wang Ruixiang then announced the preliminary decision regarding this serious breach of discipline: "Huang Xiong is relieved of his command on the spot. The entire detachment is to be transferred to Jeju Island for retraining."

However, as a sign of leniency, he announced that any refugee woman who had already established a cohabiting relationship with a soldier could be transported on the next refugee ship. After undergoing purification, they would be sent to Lin'gao for settlement. Those willing to marry the soldiers could complete the formalities after the Northbound Detachment returned to Lin'gao. Those unwilling to marry would have their cohabiting relationship dissolved and be treated as ordinary refugees.

As soon as the order was announced, the soldiers, who had been anxious, calmed down. At first, it had just been a matter of seizing an opportunity for pleasure and releasing sexual frustration. But after spending a long time with these women, feelings had inevitably developed, and they gradually felt they couldn't be apart. Although they were being sent to Jeju Island for "retraining," the Elder had acknowledged their spousal relationships. Therefore, when the "dismiss" command was given, the men let out a small cheer.

"Don't celebrate too early. Your detachment is now responsible for loading the relief rations," Wang Ruixiang said. "Use your sweat to reflect on the mistakes you've made!"

Huang Xiong's detachment went to load the carts cheerfully. This, in turn, made the replacement detachment a little envious. Wang Ruixiang called their squad leader over.

"I know what you're thinking—but you'd better keep your belts tight!" he said. "When this operation is over, there will be commendations and rewards, and your lifelong matters can also be resolved. Don't ruin your future for a moment of pleasure!"

"Reporting to you, sir! I guarantee I'll keep my belt tight!" the squad leader said, blinking. "And my men too!"

"That's right," Wang Ruixiang nodded. "Also, I'm increasing the daily relief rations for the extra refugees by ten percent. Let's try to keep a few more people alive."
