As Shi Niaoren was contemplating his next move, a commotion erupted outside. [Wu Nanhai][y009], the head of the agriculture group, was in a heated argument with He Ping, the man Shi Niaoren had sent to disinfect the toilets.

"Did you tell him to spread lime?" [Wu Nanhai][y009] demanded, his face a mask of indignation.

"Is there a problem?" Shi Niaoren asked, his voice calm. "We're disinfecting the toilets."

"Do you understand chemistry?" [Wu Nanhai][y009] jabbed a finger at the bag of lime in He Ping's hand. "Manure is a nitrogenous fertilizer. Lime is alkaline. Mix them, and you neutralize the fertilizer. What use is the excrement now?"

Shi Niaoren, a US-educated PhD, felt a flash of anger. To be lectured on basic chemistry by an undergraduate from an agricultural university was a blow to his pride. But he was also a pragmatist. [Wu Nanhai][y009] was a fellow member of the Executive Committee, and agriculture was a vital part of their new society. He swallowed his pride.

"It was an oversight," he said, his voice placating. He had been focused on disinfection, not fertilizer. Lime was the simplest method. He had been saving the bleach for the drinking water. Now, with both options off the table, he needed a new plan. Sealed storage was the most effective, but that required a three-stage septic tank, a luxury they could not afford. There were natural plants that could be used, but he couldn't remember their names, and even if he could, he wouldn't know how to identify them.

His train of thought was interrupted by the arrival of Tian Jiujiu, who had come to inquire about the water treatment plan.

"It's really one in, one out," Shi Niaoren muttered to himself.

He met Tian Jiujiu at the riverbank. The Wenlan River was their only viable source of fresh water, but a quick inspection revealed a high concentration of algae, a sign of organic pollution. The water was usable, but it would require a complex process of sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Without the necessary building materials, such a system was impossible.

"We'll have to transport water from the ship," he sighed, and went to report to [Ma Qianzhu][y005].

The *Fengcheng* had a large freshwater tank, but it was designed for a crew of fifty, not six hundred. The desalination equipment on the auxiliary engine could not keep up with the demand.

"Using the auxiliary engine for fresh water," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] lamented, "is like exchanging diesel for water. And the river doesn't flow with diesel."

But Shi Niaoren was adamant. The risk of infectious disease was too great. Cholera and typhoid were endemic to this region. A compromise was reached. A centralized water supply station would be established on shore, fed by a flexible pipe from the ship. The water would be used for drinking and washing only. Bathing would have to wait.

As twilight deepened, the transmigrators returned to the camp, their bodies weary but their spirits high. The logging group, their tools slung over their shoulders, emerged from the mangrove forest. The tide was receding, the setting sun painting the sky in fiery hues. The fleet, anchored in the bay, was silhouetted against the brilliant gold and red of the sunset, a scene of breathtaking, terrible beauty.

The camp itself had begun to take shape. A five-meter-wide, two-meter-deep moat, filled with water from the Wenlan River, now surrounded the beacon tower and the inspection office. The inner bank was topped with a two-meter-high barbed wire fence, and behind it, a long rampart with a trench. Six eight-meter-high wooden watchtowers stood sentinel along the perimeter.

Torches flickered along the rampart, their light dancing on the dark water of the moat. The main gate was open, two sentries standing guard beside a pair of dazzling carbide lamps. The transmigrators filed through, their ID tags scanned, their tools returned to the depot.

"Liu Zheng," the clerk at the registration point said, her eyes flicking from the computer screen to his face. "Your barracks number is Building B, No. 14."
