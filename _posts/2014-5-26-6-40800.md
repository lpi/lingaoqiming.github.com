The boy, who had been meek and submissive, now wore a look of defiance. But, wary of the sword in his hand, he only muttered, "The government never does anything good for us, except take our money and grain..."

Zhuo Yifan caught his breath. "What do you mean, 'nothing good'? You've enjoyed two hundred years of peace in this remote and barbaric land of Hainan, with food and clothing. Isn't that the grace of our great Ming Dynasty? As for paying taxes and grain, that is your duty. Besides, I heard you say your family were tenant farmers. Isn't it the landowners who pay the taxes?"

"Before the Chiefs arrived, we were constantly plagued by Li bandits, and the government never cared. Besides, the landowners' taxes are passed on to us tenants..." the boy said. "A few years ago, Old Master Zhou raised the rent every year, saying it was the court's decree. But after the Chiefs came, Old Master Zhou didn't dare to raise the rent anymore, and even reduced it by a lot!"

Zhuo Yifan sighed. "Did the髡贼 force him to reduce the rent?"

"Not really," the boy said. "The Chiefs have opened many businesses in Nanbao—mines, shops, and big factories. My parents aren't very skilled, they only know how to farm, so they went to work as long-term laborers on the farm. It's hard work, but at least our whole family has food to eat and clothes to wear, and we've even rebuilt our house. It's much better than the half-starved life we had as tenants for Old Master Zhou. Who would want to rent his land now?" At this, he couldn't help but feel a little proud. "Old Master Zhou is now begging people to rent his land, but who cares!"

A place where landlords begged farmers to rent their land! Zhuo Yifan was astonished. He had traveled the world and seen much, and he had seen many disputes between landlords and tenants that ended in death. Unless there was no law in the land or a great disaster had scattered the farmers, renting land was always a seller's market. The main conflicts between landlords and tenants were over "seizing/resisting seizure of tenancy" and "raising/lowering rent."

The world of Lingao was too strange. The grain-producing households were the foundation of the court, yet the髡贼 treated them this way. Sooner or later, they would lose the hearts of the people. He sighed softly, suddenly feeling that these 髡贼 were quite capable of "governing." It was just that they followed some kind of perverse and heretical doctrine. If they continued this way, they would be wasting their talents in "commerce and industry." At this thought, he felt a sense of regret. He couldn't help but say, "What a pity! The 髡贼 have the skills of Lu Ban and the talent of Tao Zhu, but unfortunately, they have not learned the right path." He glanced at the boy again, feeling that he was a promising talent, and sighed, "The 髡贼 are truly misleading the youth! All this useless, miscellaneous knowledge!"

Zhuo Yifan didn't know that children of this age had the strongest interest in learning and the greatest thirst for knowledge. Although this boy had only been in school for a few months, the "Australians" had been in Nanbao for several years. He was part of a new generation that had watched Nanbao transform from a desolate mountain village into a bustling town, and had personally experienced the changes in their lives. Hearing Zhuo Yifan belittle the "Chiefs'" knowledge and say that studying their books was useless, he couldn't help but argue, "Sir, what you're saying is too arbitrary. In the future, when I learn the Chiefs' knowledge, I can grow more rice, weave more cloth, make better farm tools, and work more conveniently. We can all live in tiled houses, and our children and grandchildren will never have to go hungry again..."

Zhuo Yifan sneered inwardly. So the 髡贼 relied on making empty promises to deceive the common people. A bumpkin is a bumpkin, easily fooled by a few words. Seeing the boy's虔诚 expression, he was probably deeply deluded. Well, his own life was in danger, so why bother with this? He stopped talking.

He was seriously injured. Although he had been treated with medicine and there was no inflammation, he had lost a lot of blood and had been on the run all night. After talking for a while, he felt dizzy. Being very alert, he quickly tore off a piece of rotten cloth and gagged the boy before he fainted.

He didn't know how much time had passed. Suddenly, he felt someone shaking him. Zhuo Yifan opened his eyes and saw Sima Qiudao's anxious face.

"Sima..."

"Where's the boy?!" Sima Qiudao blurted out.

Zhuo Yifan was startled. He looked at the tree and saw only a schoolbag strap on the ground. The strap was made of canvas, very strong, but also very stiff, so it hadn't been pulled tight, and the boy had managed to escape.

"Oh no..."

"Let's go, quickly," Sima Qiudao said. "We can't stay here!" He helped Zhuo Yifan up.

"What about Brother Huang and the others?"

Sima Qiudao said, "I went into the town. I hadn't gone far when I heard a commotion ahead. The 髡贼 had sent a team of Japanese pirates to surround the Huang Family Pharmacy!" His tone and expression were extremely pained. "I didn't dare to go any closer, so I slipped away."

Zhuo Yifan's heart sank, but he couldn't worry about that now. It was every man for himself.

"We'll just go around Nanbao. It's not far from the Li district." He supported himself with a wooden stick and started walking.

Sima Qiudao saw that Zhuo Yifan's face was pale and his lips were bloodless, and his heart tightened. He took a step forward, supported Zhuo Yifan with his right hand, and said, "Let me help you. We'll reach Fanbao Mountain before dark, and then we'll sneak across the pass after nightfall. Seventh Master said there's no barracks there anymore, just a checkpoint, so it should be easy to get through."

The two of them supported each other down the mountain, crossed the fields, and headed for a small hill in front of them. Although he was being supported, Zhuo Yifan felt a sharp pain in his wound with every step, especially under his ribs. Even a slight breath was agonizing.

Am I going to die?

He dragged his feet, feeling his body grow heavier and his head dizzier.

Worried about being discovered by the 髡贼, the two of them took a long detour, avoiding populated areas and sticking to the dense mountain forests. This made their progress even more difficult.

After walking for about half an hour, Sima Qiudao saw that Zhuo Yifan was staggering and could barely walk, so he sat him down behind a large rock.

"You rest for a moment. I'll go find you some water." He unbuttoned Zhuo Yifan's clothes and saw that the bandage was soaked with blood. He knew that the wound had not healed well due to the long journey.

Sima Qiudao worried secretly: If this continues, Zhuo Yifan will die on the road!

The only hope now was to escape into the Li district and rely on the connections of the righteous men there to find a hidden place for him to recover.

He picked up the bamboo tube to get water, but Zhuo Yifan grabbed his arm and said in a low voice, "Listen!"

Sima Qiudao listened intently but heard nothing. Just as he was about to speak, a strange sound came from the small mountain where they had rested last night, getting closer and closer. It sounded like a roar.

"It sounds like a dog barking," Sima Qiudao said. But it wasn't the bark of a common street dog; it was a sound like a roar. Sima Qiudao quickly pushed aside the bushes and looked in the direction of the sound. He saw a black and yellow dog emerge from the woods on the opposite slope. The dog had a round head, drooping ears, and two large white spots above its eyes, making it look like it had four eyes. Strangely, the dog seemed to have no tail!

Behind the dog were three or four short, sturdy soldiers wearing lacquered hats and with swords at their waists. Sima Qiudao knew that these were the Japanese pirates raised by the 髡贼!

The dog was on a leash, held by a man, and was constantly sniffing the ground. The dog was surprisingly large, the size of a calf. The man holding it could barely control it, and was constantly being pulled forward, as if he was about to fall. Then, three more identical dogs emerged from the woods, all sniffing the ground. Behind the dog handlers were more than a dozen soldiers with muskets, both Japanese pirates and regular soldiers. Next to an officer-like figure stood a young boy, pointing and gesturing. Sima Qiudao was shocked: it was the herb-gathering boy who had escaped!

Zhuo Yifan also saw it, and he cursed himself inwardly. But it was useless to say anything now. He could only curl up and try to make himself a smaller target.

The dogs on the other side were sniffing the ground and walking towards them. Zhuo Yifan whispered, "They probably smelled the blood."

"The 髡贼 are cunning, to use such a trick!" Sima Qiudao said without turning his head. "Brother Zhuo, let's split up. Otherwise, if they catch up, neither of us will get away. Over this small hill and a few more miles is Fanbao Mountain. You go slowly. As long as you get there before dark, you'll have a chance to escape tonight!"

He paused and then said, "I'll go down the mountain now, cross the valley in front, and take the small mountain on the left to meet you at Fanbao Mountain."

Zhuo Yifan was shocked. The path Sima Qiudao was taking was almost under the noses of the 髡贼. He was deliberately trying to draw them away.

"Brother Sima, you can't! I'm seriously injured and probably don't have much time left. You're not injured and can walk fast. You go. Leave me here to hold off the 髡贼's pursuers. I'll kill as many as I can!"

"Brother Zhuo, don't refuse. I, Sima Qiudao, have crawled out of piles of dead bodies and escaped from the chaos of battle. I'm already living on borrowed time. Besides, I run fast. The 髡贼 will definitely chase after me with all their might. The farther I run, the more time you'll have to escape—one of us has to make it!"

As he spoke, he tightened his clothes and tucked his knife into his belt.

"Brother Qiudao!" Zhuo Yifan was so choked up he couldn't speak.

Sima Qiudao looked at him and deliberately smiled. "Brother Zhuo, how do you know I can't escape? Don't worry! Back then, the Tartar cavalry couldn't catch me. What are a few dogs? We'll meet again!" With that, he cupped his fists and said, "Sima Qiudao is off!"

As he turned to leave, Sima Qiudao suddenly stopped. He turned his head slightly, his back to Zhuo Yifan, and said, "Brother Zhuo, if you can escape with your life and have the chance to go to Beijing, please burn a stick of incense at Lord Yuan Yingtai's grave for me. I was his advisor back then. When Liaoyang fell, I should have died with him... I'm going!"
