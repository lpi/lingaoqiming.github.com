He didn't have a particularly deep impression of Zhuo Tianmin. He remembered that he had a son who had once gone to the Executive Committee to find [Xiao Zishan][y001] and asked him to write a note to [Wu Nanhai][y009] to give him an egg—for his son to eat—eggs were the most sought-after item at the moment. There were only three or four a day, and they were generally only supplied to the sick.

He looked to be in his mid-thirties, wearing a training uniform stained with stone powder and mud. He pointed at the newly built pressure pool, not looking at anyone, and said, "...according to the design drawings: the bottom plate of the intake chamber should be higher than the bottom plate of the forebay. But now they are built at the same height."

The engineering team members surrounded him, all silent. Mei Wan was a little impatient: "It's just a few centimeters of difference, what's the big deal? If we have to follow the design drawings for everything, this will be a shoddy project."

"That's a substitute measure because of the lack of materials, there's no other way," Zhuo Tianmin said, getting angry when he heard this. "This pressure pool didn't skimp on cement, stones, or yellow sand. Why wasn't it built according to the drawings?"

"The engineering team members are not familiar with the drawings and didn't pay attention..." Bing Feng tried to smooth things over.

"That makes even less sense. The workers are all novices, not professional workers. The responsibility is not on them, that's right. We all make a living from engineering and construction. Are we still proud of such a low-level mistake?" The people around were all whispering.

The faces of several professional personnel turned red. Mei Wan couldn't refute him either, so he had to say, "Then what do you suggest?"

"Tear it down and rebuild it according to the dimensions in the drawings."

"This will not only waste materials, but also delay the construction period!" Mei Wan almost jumped up. "Besides, you are not from a hydropower major. Do you know why the front and back of the pool are made at different heights? The things on the drawings are not necessarily right. There are many such things."

"I really don't know, but it's precisely because we don't know that we can't be vague about the drawings at all."

At this time, someone discovered [Wang Luobin][y003] and said, "Committee Member Wang is here!"

When Zhuo Tianmin heard that [Wang Luobin][y003] had come, he turned around and saw that [Wang Luobin][y003] was indeed standing in the crowd. He politely nodded to [Wang Luobin][y003] and said no more.

"Engineer Zhuo, please continue."

"I've said everything I have to say, and I really don't know anything about hydropower construction. Committee Member Wang, you decide." Zhuo Tianmin said coldly. He wanted to see how capable this executive committee member was. Everyone's eyes were focused on [Wang Luobin][y003].

[Wang Luobin][y003] walked around the pool and measured the depth of each part with a measuring rod. After the inspection, he asked Zhuo Tianmin for his opinion, "Engineer Zhuo, what do you think we should do?"

Zhuo Tianmin said, "Not building according to the drawings means the quality is not up to standard. It's okay to muddle through, but I'm afraid there will be problems in the future."

[Wang Luobin][y003] turned to Mei Wan and asked, "What do you think?"

Mei Wan thought for a moment and said, "It is indeed different from the drawings, but now we are short of materials and have to meet the deadline. I think we can make do with it! We can change it later when we have the conditions."

This proposal was approved by some of the construction team members.

[Wang Luobin][y003] nodded and said, "If we rework it, we will waste some cement and steel bars, and it will also delay the time for power generation and grid connection, but this matter cannot be compromised."

He pointed to the pool: "The width and depth of the forebay should be larger than the channel, so that the water flow slows down after entering the forebay, and the sediment in the water will settle down. This is the first step. The bottom of the intake chamber is higher than the bottom of the forebay to prevent the settled sediment from rushing into the pressure pipe. This ensures the safe operation of the turbine."

Mei Wan knew that he had once again misunderstood the meaning of the Executive Committee on this matter. The experience of building the highway made him think that the Executive Committee mainly looked at the speed of the project, so this time he insisted on prioritizing the progress. Seeing that the people in the construction team were all staring at him, he waved his hand in annoyance:

"Stop looking, quickly tear down the problematic parts and rework them!"

The construction team jumped into the pool and began to knock on the parts that needed to be reworked with an eight-pound hammer. The concrete blocks peeled off and fell. [Wang Luobin][y003] felt a pang of heartache. He didn't know when they would be able to make cement. The long-range reconnaissance team was sent out precisely to find various resources. They had been gone for almost a week now. Although there was radio contact every day, the resource exploration situation had not yet been reported...

Zhuo Tianmin stood aside and watched [Wang Luobin][y003], as if he had only met [Wang Luobin][y003] today. His usual impression of these executive committee members was that they were amiable and slick. [Xiao Zishan][y001] was a typical example. He would never say a word that would make you unhappy, but you couldn't tell his attitude towards a certain matter. Even if he had to act as a decision-maker in some disputes, he would use a set of words to make everyone feel that they had not lost face—he admired such people, but at the same time, he looked down on them, feeling that this was a survival means for people who had no profession.

He knew very well that he had become a taboo for Mei Wan after speaking out in the construction engineering team several times, but he didn't care at all—wasn't it to leave that hypocritical and empty living environment that he brought his son here? If he had to continue that set of things in another time and space, why would he come?

The wind was very strong, and the trees with soft branches swayed vigorously. The vegetation here at Bairen Tan was better preserved than in other places. The forests on the nearby rolling low hills were dense, and the sound of the wind blowing through the trees came in waves. The wind suddenly became stronger, and the weather also became gloomy, looking like it was about to rain. After the reworked parts were torn down, Mei Wan immediately reorganized his forces and personally led the engineering team to rush the repairs. The work of pouring the concrete had to be completed before the rain. [Wang Luobin][y003] was also on the construction site helping to clean up the debris. As he worked, he thought, just as [Wen Zong][y002] had talked to him in private, the affairs in the group were not as simple as imagined. From the way he had organized and arranged the construction these days, it was clear that there were already cracks within the construction team.

After the concrete was re-poured, the installation of the turbine began immediately. The installation of the turbine had high requirements. The level had to be measured, and it was best to hoist it into place in one go. Mei Wan called over the steam crane. After an afternoon of tossing and turning, the turbine was finally hoisted into place. Because there were no bricks and tiles available for the generator room, a shed was temporarily built as a cover.

The engineering team, braving the light rain, cleaned up the rubble and garbage on the construction site, installed the diversion channel gate, and finally completely dug out the soil and stones at the water intake. The arc-shaped wooden gate played its role, and the water did not rush in. Now they just had to wait for the concrete to dry completely before they could generate electricity.

This small hydropower station with a water head of 20 meters and a water flow of two cubic meters per second could provide 200KW of electricity for the base. The future long-term plan was to reach a power generation capacity of 1000KW with 5 units.

Because two generators would be generating electricity at the same time, the original simple mode of pulling wires for power supply had to be changed. [Chang Kaishen][y010] planned to establish a new power grid system. The system was purchased as a complete set. This power grid would use 110 kV high-voltage power transmission, and the electricity consumption would use industrial 380 volts and civil 220 volts. These were all existing voltage standards in this time and space, and also met the power consumption needs of the various mechanical equipment they brought.

For the sake of safety, Mei Wan originally planned to install all the transmission lines of the power grid underground, but there were no suitable corrosion-resistant cable conduits, so they continued to use overhead power transmission with utility poles. Fortunately, the total length of the line from the hydropower area to the main urban area was only 100 meters, which was completely within sight. If necessary, the two areas could be connected with a city wall, but there was no need for that for the time being.

With electricity, the next project was the water supply system. The water quality of the Wenlan River was mainly polluted by the wastewater and waste from the residential areas and farmland in the upstream county town, so the organic matter content was relatively high, there were many algae, and the sediment content was very small. For this kind of water quality, it was not enough to rely solely on the traditional methods of sediment precipitation and disinfection. The algae would bring an unpleasant smell that even the smell of chlorine could not cover up. During the large-scale blue-green algae bloom in the Wuxi section of Taihu Lake, the water quality of the tap water factory at that time was fully qualified in terms of physical and chemical standards, but the smell could not be eliminated.

Tian Jiujiu, as a professional in water supply and drainage, after inspecting the hydrological terrain, decided to adopt a percolation intake—the river water would first percolate through the soil on the river bank and then enter the reservoir. The water obtained in this way was usually not polluted and did not require much treatment.

The simplest model is to dig a percolation well. However, Tian Jiujiu considered that the population to be supplied was large, and the water consumption of modern people's living habits was also large, so he adopted a more complex percolation gallery water supply system.

First, a water collection pipe trench was dug parallel to the river bank at a distance of 15 meters from the river. The excavation depth of the water collection trench had to be 1 meter below the lowest water level line. The pipe trench was a filter bed composed of multiple layers of sand, gravel, and small crushed stones of different specifications. A water collection pipe was buried in the middle of the filter bed. In modern times, this kind of pipe is generally a perforated PVC plastic pipe with a diameter of 50-100mm. Tian Jiujiu did not have this kind of PVC plastic pipe, so he used a concrete pipe. A round log with a diameter of 200mm was used as the inner mold, and it was cast in place with a mixture of gravel, fine sand, and cement. This kind of pipe did not need to be too dense, but was required to be loose and porous. The joints of the pipes were not sealed—so that the groundwater entering the water collection trench could seep into the pipe. The entire pipe trench was covered with a layer of soil no less than 30mm thick.

Finally, at the northern end of the pipe trench, at the lowest point of the terrain, a clear water well was built with concrete mortar and stone. The clear water that seeped into the water collection pipe was finally flowed here to settle. The construction engineering team made a reinforced concrete cover for this well. The settled clear water was pumped into an elevated water tower by a pump. The base of the water tower was built with stones and cement mortar. A ten-ton water tank dismantled from a ship was installed on top. The outside of the water tank was coated with a layer of cement mortar for waterproofing and rust prevention. An ozone generator was installed outside the water tower. This device used a high-frequency electronic device to generate ozone for sterilization. The sterilization effect of ozone was not worse than that of chlorine, and it did not require a complex electrolysis device and pipelines, and it was not very harmful to the human body. Before the salt electrolysis device was put into operation, this thing could last for a long time.

In order to prevent typhoons, the entire elevated water tank was firmly anchored to the ground with thick ship cables. The main water transmission pipeline to the main urban area was made of PVC material. Because the construction team's large-scale underground municipal culvert project had not yet started, this water transmission pipeline was temporarily buried in a shallow trench.
