Chen Tianxiong looked at this "labor leader" of ancient times, his face ashen, and felt a surge of contempt. He had originally thought that anyone who could mobilize several hundred workers must be a figure of some consequence, but he turned out to be so spineless. It seemed Xiao Zhanfeng's description of him as "all bark and no bite" was spot on.

"Get up and speak," Chen Tianxiong said with some disgust. "Huanan is aware of the hardships you sugar mill workers are facing. That's why my employer has sent me to make friends with you, so we don't harm our relationship."

Lin Zhuang, hearing that his life wasn't in danger, finally came to his senses. He carefully considered Master Chen's words; it seemed there was room for negotiation. He answered cautiously:

"Your Honor, please understand! We sugar mill workers live from hand to mouth, a precarious existence. Now that our livelihood is cut off, and many of us have families to support, life is truly difficult. We only accepted Third Master Zhu's silver out of desperation to feed ourselves. We have no personal grudge against Huanan..."

He was clever enough not to mention that Huanan had driven the sugar mills out of business and caused the workers to lose their jobs, so as not to provoke the other party.

Chen Tianxiong remained silent, waiting to see what else he would say.

"As for the rumors that the sugar mill workers are going to cause trouble at Huanan, that's absolutely not true. I can swear on my life."

"So, the widespread rumor that the sugar mill masters are going to burn incense and take an oath to attack Huanan is false?"

"There were preparations to burn incense," Lin Zhuang knew he couldn't deny this, so he equivocated on the key point. "But it's not what the rumors say! It was just to get everyone to stick together to get through these hard times, not specifically to target Huanan."

This explanation was barely plausible, but Chen Tianxiong had no intention of arguing with him about right and wrong—this matter was beyond such distinctions.

"Huanan bears some responsibility for the sugar mill workers ending up in this situation. My employer often laments this, saying he has let everyone down! To make amends, he is now willing to hire all of you to work in the factory. Anyone who can work, man or woman, old or young, will be given a wage. Since you are the leader, I will make a decision on his behalf. After this is settled, you will receive a separate reward. What do you think?"

The words were clear, but Lin Zhuang was still taken aback. The meaning, however, was unmistakable. Huanan was willing to hire all the unemployed sugar boilers. This was, of course, a huge boon for everyone. At the very least, the livelihoods of these several hundred people would be secured, and he would have something to show for his efforts.

But while this was good for everyone else, it wasn't necessarily good for him. Once everyone was employed by the factory, what need would there be for him as a leader? He would lose all the benefits he currently enjoyed. Moreover, he had taken over two hundred taels of silver from Third Master Zhu. To go back on his promise and switch sides to Huanan would make him a textbook "traitor." Huanan was not to be trifled with, but neither was Third Master Zhu.

He hesitated, unable to agree.

"What, do you have concerns?" Chen Tianxiong saw the changing expressions on his face and knew what he was thinking. He didn't expose him, letting him voice his own intentions.

"Master Chen, please understand! This is, of course, a great thing for us sugar mill workers. But Third Master Zhu has been very generous, supporting everyone for the past two months. I'm afraid if I go back and say this, they won't listen to me..."

Chen Tianxiong laughed. "Ridiculous. You'd rather eat the Haiyi Guild's moldy, old rice than Huanan's fresh white rice? Are there really such loyal people in this world?"

Lin Zhuang couldn't voice his unspoken difficulties. The silver Third Master Zhu had given him wasn't enough for white rice, but it could have provided white rice porridge. He had embezzled a large portion of it, so he could only afford the cheapest, moldy old rice to fill their bellies. When the workers complained, he blamed it on the Haiyi Guild giving him too little money, just enough to keep them from starving. So, Third Master Zhu's standing among the workers wasn't particularly high.

If he went back and told everyone now, most of the workers would naturally want to go to Huanan. In that case, he would have no way to explain himself to Third Master Zhu. Even if Third Master Zhu didn't harm him, just demanding the silver back would be enough to ruin him.

Lin Zhuang looked at Zhou Shidi, then at Chen Tianxiong, his eyes darting about, unable to answer.

As he hesitated, a bright light flashed before his eyes. Chen Tianxiong placed the small chest he had brought with him on the table and opened the lid, revealing neat stacks of foreign silver coins, all brand new and gleaming. There was also a pile of loose silver and several "medium ingots." He estimated it was about a hundred taels, clearly intended for him.

"This is five hundred 'Spanish dollars'," Chen Tianxiong said, "which is nearly four hundred taels of silver. Consider it a settlement fee from Huanan for the unemployed workers. It will be distributed once the hiring is confirmed. You will also receive a personal gift of one hundred taels."

The number spoken was one thing, but seeing the actual silver laid out before him was another. Chen Tianxiong knew that nothing was more persuasive than the sight of real gold and silver. These several hundred silver coins were prepared specifically for this purpose. He was patient, letting Lin Zhuang think.

"Don't force yourself," Chen Tianxiong said. "If you have difficulties, feel free to speak up."

"Oh... yes, yes..." Lin Zhuang said, as if waking from a dream.

He had been around the block and, in a flash of thought, came up with a new line of reasoning:

"Master Chen!" he said with a look of utmost sincerity. "Please understand! I have been entrusted by the sugar mill workers, and I must find a proper way out for them. I am extremely grateful that Huanan is willing to hire them. On behalf of the workers, I thank your employer!" He bowed deeply, then changed his tone. "But as the middleman, I have many difficulties. To be honest, I need a way to explain this to Third Master Zhu. Otherwise, if he loses face, a lowly fire-stoker like me cannot bear the consequences!"

"What difficulties? Just say it!" Chen Tianxiong guessed he was trying to angle for more personal benefits.

"Yes, I only ask for your employer's understanding," he said. "The incense-burning and oath-taking ceremony at the Zou Heshang Temple tomorrow, I ask that you allow it to proceed..."

"Oh, and then?" Chen Tianxiong was noncommittal.

"The incense-burning is just for show, to placate Third Master Zhu and avoid his meddling. It's a delaying tactic. I will then go and persuade the workers. When the time is right, I will send a message, and your employer can send a couple of capable people to handle the recruitment directly. It's just that—" he lowered his voice, "I won't be able to stay in Xuwen after this. I'll need your employer to provide some travel expenses..."

Lin Zhuang's words sounded comprehensive and reasonable, but they were actually a delaying tactic to play both sides. His plan was to use the incense-burning ceremony to appease the Haiyi Guild, take Huanan's money upfront with an empty promise, and then leak some information to Third Master Zhu that Huanan was trying to "pacify" the unemployed workers through recruitment. Third Master Zhu would naturally have to pay him to keep the situation under control. Although this would eventually be exposed, he could buy some time. If things got too hot, he could just pack up and leave.

This simple scheme didn't fool Chen Tianxiong.

"The incense-burning and oath-taking is out of the question," Chen Tianxiong immediately rejected. Although it was a ceremony, it was a clear declaration by the sugar mill workers that they were enemies of Huanan. After that, any forceful action from Huanan would be seen as bullying, and any soft approach would be a loss of face, putting them in a very passive position.

"If you don't allow it, I really can't explain it to Third Master Zhu. Please, Your Honor, have mercy and give me a way out!"

Chen Tianxiong snorted. "Master Lin! I advise you to think clearly and don't try to play both sides." He sneered. "My employer is taking pity on the unemployed sugar mill workers and wants to give them a chance. Since you're unwilling, and you want to lead them in an oath-taking ceremony, go ahead. Huanan won't stop you."

Lin Zhuang panicked. If Chen Tianxiong really walked away, there would be no turning back. Once the conflict started, he would be a pawn for the Haiyi Guild. Regardless of who won, his fate would depend on Third Master Zhu's conscience.

"Let's... let's discuss this further!"

"There's nothing to discuss." Chen Tianxiong suddenly smiled and closed the silver chest. "I know you're a man of the world, so I'll be frank with you," he said. "I just need one word from you. Yes, or no?"

The gleaming silver coins were as good as gone, seemingly waiting for his answer. To give up such an opportunity felt like a pity. He blurted out, "I'll find a way. I'll definitely get this done."

"Good, that's more like it!" Chen Tianxiong knew he had fallen into the trap. "My employer said: since we are hiring, we need a roster. Once they join the factory, they will receive a settlement fee. You will be in charge of distributing it; we won't interfere. I just need to know if you can provide a list?"

A roster, he certainly had one. It was his meal ticket. Third Master Zhu had only agreed to give him silver after seeing the roster and knowing he had several hundred men at his disposal. This Master Chen was asking for it to calculate the settlement fee, but it was more likely to gauge his strength. This was an opportunity to show off. Besides, there was usually a twenty percent kickback for the person handling such payments. Lin Zhuang knew this and was very excited. He quickly said:

"I have it, but there's only one copy. I'll need to have it transcribed..."

"No problem," Chen Tianxiong answered crisply. "I have a scribe with me."

"Alright then." Lin Zhuang took out a blue cloth bundle from his robes, carefully unwrapped it, and revealed a tattered book cover containing a ledger-like book made of rough paper. On it was written "United in Heart and Virtue."

"This is the roster, originally made for the lawsuit with the county yamen," Lin Zhuang said. "The names were written by a scribe, but each one has a thumbprint next to it."

The book was greasy and stained. Opening it, Chen Tianxiong saw rows of names, each with a dense cluster of red thumbprints and the person's registered household details: district, village. Some names also had notes like "sugar boiler" or "fire-stoker." It was undoubtedly a genuine roster.

"There are one hundred and seventy-four people in total. There are also about twenty apprentices who aren't on the list because they have nowhere to go."

"Wait a moment, I'll have someone copy it." He passed the original to Xiao Zhanfeng in the next room, telling him to copy it immediately.

Xiao Zhanfeng had an ink box with him and started writing at once. To avoid a boring wait, Chen Tianxiong ordered several pots of wine and seven or eight dishes, pulling Lin Zhuang over to drink with him. He kept him occupied, extracting a great deal of information about Third Master Zhu and the Haiyi Guild.

When the wine was finished, the roster was also copied. Chen Tianxiong returned the original.

"Go back and think it over. The day after tomorrow, in the morning, I'll be waiting for your news!" He pushed a fifty-tael ingot in front of him. "Take this fifty taels for now."

Lin Zhuang was overjoyed but still made a token refusal, "This isn't customary!"

"Customs are made by people. This is my custom. Take this fifty taels, and you'll have more energy to work for me."

"Of course, of course," Lin Zhuang was already babbling.

With the matter settled, there was no need to stay. The three of them left Sister-in-law Ai's place and returned to the Dachang Rice Shop. Xiao Zhanfeng asked, "Can we trust what Lin Zhuang said?"

"Of course not," Chen Tianxiong said. "But I have another trick up my sleeve for him. He'll see it as soon as he returns to the Zou Heshang Temple."

"What if he doesn't go back? You gave him fifty taels. He might just squander it here."

"This is a matter of life and death for him. He has to go back and think it over," Chen Tianxiong said confidently. "He's probably lost his appetite for gambling and whoring."

He stopped and said, "Zhanfeng, I don't think you need to go home. Come and stay at Huanan. We're in need of a clerk to handle paperwork. I'll give you a few taels a month, and you'll have a steady income."

"Thank you for your concern." Xiao Zhanfeng politely declined. "But for now, it's better for me to remain independent. It's more convenient for me to say and do things."

Chen Tianxiong thought for a moment and agreed. He was being thorough.

"Take this silver for now," Chen Tianxiong said, seeing his dire situation. Although he had been refused yesterday, he still offered some loose silver. "Consider it a loan from me!"

"No, no." Xiao Zhanfeng still shook his head. "I'm not being difficult! Now is not the time to take your silver! When the time comes for me to speak out, if people say I've taken your money, not only will my words carry no weight, but everything I've said before will be dismissed as nonsense!"

"No one will know about this," Chen Tianxiong said, unconvinced.

"Heaven knows, the earth knows, you know, and I know. How can you say no one knows!" Xiao Zhanfeng said with conviction. "A man of integrity must stand tall and straight. What is, is. What is not, is not."

"Alright, I won't insist." Chen Tianxiong couldn't help but feel a sincere admiration for this old-fashioned intellectual.

"But your current situation, with your food and clothing in jeopardy, you can't just keep bothering Auntie Liu every day."
