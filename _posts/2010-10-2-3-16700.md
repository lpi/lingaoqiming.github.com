"The difference is huge," Wu Nanhai explained. "There are actually many types of landlords. The landlords we are familiar with are mostly those who exploit through a tenancy model. These landlords divide their land into small plots and lease them to tenant farmers. According to the traditional landlord-tenant relationship in China, once the land is leased, what to plant and how to plant it is the tenant's business. As long as the tenant can pay the rent, the landlord has no right to interfere in their production activities. Sometimes, they even lose the right to replace the tenant. Therefore, they are not interested in improving agricultural technology. Their main focus is on dealing with the tenants and ensuring they pay their rent on time and in full."

"In contrast, managerial landlords are more like modern agricultural capitalists. They hire long-term and short-term laborers and pay them wages. Some of them are even tenants themselves, so they have a strong desire to obtain high profits from the land. Since they can't simply increase rent to gain profit, they have to get more output from the land. Their demand for agricultural technology is much stronger."

"A tenant? If they are a tenant, how can they also be a landlord?"

"Heh, you must not know the term 'tenant-rich peasant' from the land reform era. In fact, it's inappropriate to call such people landlords. They are professional land managers, usually with substantial capital or specialized skills, who lease large areas of land directly from landlords and profit by growing high-value cash crops."

"I see," Wan Lihui nodded, a little ashamed. "And I come from a peasant family..."

"Heh, the rural society you came from is long past being like this," Wu Nanhai said. "In this time and space, Guangdong, Fujian, and the Jiangnan region are precisely in an era where managerial landlords are on the rise. However, they mainly focus on growing cash crops; managerial landlords who focus purely on grain are rare. These are the ones we need to support."

"Managerial landlords are quite capitalist-like," Ye Yuming said. "They represent the advanced productive forces of this time, right?"

"Therefore, our agricultural policy is: support managerial landlords, protect independent farmers, and squeeze out tenant-landlords, gradually causing them to disappear or transform into managerial landlords."

"What about the tenants? If we eliminate the tenant-landlords, the tenants will lose their means of survival. The Executive Committee isn't planning land reform, so how do we solve the land issue for this group? Under the tenancy system, they at least have a way to live. If we get rid of all the tenant-landlords, won't they be unable to even eat?"

"Lincheng has a lot of wasteland. We can give them seeds and plow oxen, help them reclaim land, and organize them to build irrigation systems..."

Wu De directly objected: "All that effort will only create a new batch of small independent farmers in Lincheng. We don't need to expand the base of independent farmers here—it's useless to us."

"That's not bad. Small independent farmers will fight desperately to defend their own land and homes."

"The working class will fight just as desperately, and since they have nothing, they won't be thinking about going home to plant in the spring or harvest in the fall," Wu De joked. "Alright, in reality, to defend one's home, the common people don't necessarily need fifty mu of land to farm—as long as this society is prosperous, stable, and happy for you, that's enough."

"As for absorbing surplus labor, there are many solutions. The simplest is through industry," Wu De continued. "Then there's agriculture itself. We don't need farmers; we need agricultural workers. Except for a few crops, everything else will be cultivated intensively on large tracts of land."

Wen Desi coughed, about to speak, when Li Quan from the farm entered carefully, carrying a tray. This little girl, who had been rescued from Gou Family Village with her mother by Zhang Xingjiao, had grown into a rather cute loli after being cared for at the farm for over half a year. She had two black braids, wore a clean, thin silk shirt, and her large eyes twinkled.

"Chief Wen, please have some tea," Li Quan said with a sweet smile. She was young, but she was quite familiar with the main figures in the transmigrator group—these were the "big shots" who often appeared at the farm.

"Good, thank you," Wen Desi picked up the porcelain teacup. The little girl smiled and served the teacups to everyone one by one. Perhaps because they rarely saw such an adorable little girl, the group's greedy gazes fell upon her, making her blush. She quickly retreated.

Wen Desi let out a cold "hmph."

"That child, Li Quan, is studying at the National School now. She's very smart. Xiao Zishan wrote her a letter of recommendation, preparing to send her to the Military and Political Academy..." Wu Nanhai looked around and whispered courageously.

"The Military and Political Academy? Isn't she too young?" Wen Desi was puzzled, not understanding what Wu Nanhai meant.

"She won't be in a few years," Wu Nanhai's face reddened, as if he didn't want to say it. Just then, Ye Yuming started speaking again, so he had to cut himself short. Ye Yuming was now introducing measures aimed at small farmers and small landlords.

For this group, the Heaven and Earth Society would mainly promote livestock farming techniques and engage in contract farming, with the Agriculture Committee buying up all the produce.

This business wasn't as simple as directly giving chickens and ducks to the farmers; instead, it used a micro-loan model.

"I suggest we hand this matter over to Delong Grain Company," Ye Yuming said. "If Delong feels the business is too amateurish, it can be delegated to the Agriculture Committee to handle..."

"No problem, Delong is a financial institution by nature, so handling micro-loans is part of its duty," Yan Ming said. "This is better, it's easier for accounting."

He proposed that during the disbursement process, they should directly issue grain coupons. The borrowers could then use these coupons to purchase a certain number of poultry from the Heaven and Earth Society to raise. The loan amounts would be very small, equivalent to the value of five to ten chickens.

The farmers would buy the chicks from the Heaven and Earth Society, raise them, and then submit 20 eggs to the society as principal and interest for the chicks. Then, the Heaven and Earth Society would purchase all the eggs at a set price per egg in coupons. When the laying hens got old, they could be sold to the food factory to be made into chicken products.

"We can form joint ventures with the local big landlords to open small-scale food processing plants. We provide the technology, they handle the management. The downstream raw materials are controlled by the Heaven and Earth Society, and the upstream sales are controlled by the Commerce Department. Even if the factory belongs to the landlords, they're just a processing plant and can't cause any trouble."

Ye Yuming laid out his plan in one breath.

"There's a process issue here," Wu Nanhai said. "The loan they receive is in coupons, but they repay the farm with eggs. The farm can't use eggs to repay the grain company's loan, can it?"

"I say let's forget it," Wen Desi said. "Let's not even talk about the issue of comparing in-kind loans and monetary loans. Have you seen poverty alleviation in poor areas? First, they gave out cash directly, and the farmers spent it all immediately. Later, they switched to giving out chickens, pigs, sheep, and so on. They'd take them home and slaughter them for food within a few days. Then they'd claim the animals died of illness. What do you do then? Do you try to collect the debt?" No one could guarantee that the peasants of this time would be any more honest and trustworthy than those of another time.

"So, instead of a loan, it would be better to structure it as a futures contract. We provide improved breeds for free upfront, then sign a contract with the farmers to purchase the product at a negotiated price, with a certain down payment. This way, at least they won't just eat the poultry. Besides, poultry farming has its risks. An outbreak of disease can cause mass deaths. This could easily lead to farmers going bankrupt because they can't repay, causing resentment. That would damage the reputation of the transmigrators and affect social stability. Therefore, livestock and poultry farming should be put on the back burner. We should focus on popularizing improved crops first."

"This is a micro-loan. I don't think ten chicks or so will bankrupt anyone, right? If they all die and the farmer can't repay, send them to the labor camp for a month to work off the debt," Ye Yuming said. "If you're still worried, we can have the employees' families raise them first. Besides, if we give them away for free, they'll just get eaten and then claimed to have died of illness anyway."

"If the farmer feels that the benefit of completing the contract is greater than just eating the chicken and drinking the deposit, he'll do a good job," Wen Desi shrugged. "Of course, people in some long-term poverty-stricken areas won't think that way. If the people of Lincheng are relatively enterprising, contract farming should be feasible. My main opposition to micro-loans comes from two concerns: first, the local people may not have the concept of borrowing to run a business; second, loans are always easily associated with negative things like usury, making them difficult to promote."

"Regarding the concept of borrowing, Chief Wen, you're overthinking it. Rural loans not only exist in Lincheng, but their forms are quite diverse," Yan Ming had done his research. Small-scale borrowing was quite common in the local countryside. Farmers often used it to buy fertilizer and tools, and also to survive during lean seasons. The lenders were mainly local landlords and wealthy households, and the loans were primarily in-kind. Interest rates varied widely, from mutual aid loans organized by local gentry and clans with an annual interest rate of less than 1.5%, to usurious loans with a monthly interest rate of 1%.

"Overall, the peasants do have some awareness of borrowing. If our loan interest rates are low, they will be willing to borrow. To further mitigate risk, we can establish standards to evaluate clients and implement risk control." Yan Ming was very interested in agricultural micro-loans—after all, this would be the first loan business he handled. Although the business was small, it was a start.

"If we do that, we won't be able to increase the income of the local farmers and win their hearts. The poor people will get nothing..."

"We need to balance it," Wen Desi said after some thought. "We won't issue loans to the truly destitute, the dirt-poor peasants. Let's start the loans with the small independent farmers. We can lower the standards a bit and make it more widespread to benefit as many people as possible."
