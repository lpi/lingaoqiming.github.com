Although Huang Ping was active, the red team's overall strength was slightly inferior, and the match ended with a victory for the blue team. When the final whistle blew, Dong Yizhi came down from the field to greet the members of the visiting group.

Liu Dalin looked at this Australian gentleman with curiosity: a dark face, a strong body, and the fine beads of sweat on his broad forehead after having just refereed a match and run back and forth with the students.

"Mr. Dong, your people truly have the Midas touch," Liu Dalin said tactfully. "I hear that most of these children are poor orphans gathered from the mainland. I never expected that after your instruction, they would all be so radiant, no longer resembling children from poor and humble households."

"Not at all," Dong Yizhi said modestly. "Didn't Confucius also say: 'In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes'? And didn't Chen Sheng and Wu Guang say: 'Are kings and nobles destined to be so by birth?' Although wealth and poverty cannot be equalized in the world, as long as everyone has the opportunity to study, the children of poor families can also truly rise."

The imperial examination system in ancient China was indeed a relatively fair system, at least in theory, guaranteeing the possibility for children from poor families to change their destiny through study and examinations. However, in reality, those who could achieve this change were few and far between. Studying in ancient society required a considerable economic foundation. The truly bottom-tier common people, unless by some chance, simply could not afford to support their children's education.

Liu Dalin himself understood this very well. He came from an official's family. Among his peers from the provincial examinations and the later Jinshi examinations, very few truly came from poor peasant families. At the very least, their families had a few acres of land or received support from their clans.

The Australians' approach to education, although they did not teach the learning of the sages, could truly be called "education for all without distinction." Although he was not a merchant and usually left his business affairs to his family, he understood that the daily cost of food and supplies for such a large school with several thousand students was an enormous sum. Not to mention the various construction costs for the school buildings themselves. Liu Dalin estimated that even the entire tax revenue of the former Lingao County could not support this school.

"Hehe, this ability to nurture people for a hundred years is also something I can never hope to match," Liu Dalin said from the bottom of his heart. "But I have never understood, your people have already conquered the four seas. If you wished, you could probably gather all the wealth in the world. Why do you still do this painstaking work? Don't you know that life is short? The talents you have spent so much to cultivate will only be useful in ten or twenty years." As he said this, his small but sharp eyes were fixed on Dong Yizhi.

Dong Yizhi was at a loss for words for a moment. He thought to himself, *How can I tell you about our dark secrets like building a harem and a human eugenics museum? I couldn't explain it to you even if I tried.* Liu Dalin watched as Yuanlao Dong's face turned a little red, as if he was struggling to think. Finally, Yuanlao Dong came up with a sentence and immediately held his head high and said:

"We run this school not for wealth, nor for power, nor for fame, but for the day when: Under the whole heaven, there is no land that is not the land of China; and within the sea-girt shore of the land, there is no one who is not a subject of China!"

For a moment, all the surrounding scholars heard this, and they were all dumbfounded. These words were extremely arrogant, far beyond the level of "rebelling and becoming emperor."

Huang Binkun thought to himself: "The height of arrogance!"

He looked at Liu Dalin's expression and saw that it was very complicated. He cursed inwardly: "You are not worthy of mentioning 'Huaxia'!" This group of people were fanatics who were "transforming China with barbarian ways," yet they hung the words "Huaxia" on their lips as a signboard all day long. They were truly shameless to the extreme.

Huang Binkun had originally wanted to take this opportunity to have a good talk with Huang Ping, especially to point out sternly that hugging a female student was "damaging to public morals," and that a girl who would hug him must also be "fickle." He wanted him to reflect on himself and not fall any further. Unexpectedly, this former servant boy showed no sense of hierarchy when he saw him. Before he could even begin his lecture, the boy brazenly said that he had to go take a shower right away and had self-study in the evening, and then he left.

"I have a physics test tomorrow, I have to go back and review," Huang Ping said. "The teacher said that if you master mathematics, physics, and chemistry, you can dominate the world. I have to put in some effort."

This left Huang Binkun feeling very disappointed. Huang Ping had served him since he was a child, and their bond was far deeper than that of an ordinary master and servant. Now that he was studying here, he seemed to have become distant. What was so special about this Australian learning that it could captivate people's hearts so much?

He didn't know if sending Huang Ping to study here had been the right move. Should he just call Huang Ping back and stop his studies? If he did that, the channel he had worked so hard to set up to understand the Australians would be cut off. If he didn't call him back, as the days went by, Huang Ping would inevitably become a "fake髡."

He was in this contradictory mood until dinner time. Dong Yizhi saw him looking a bit dazed in the cafeteria and asked if he had a poor appetite.

Huang Binkun shook his head. He suddenly asked, "I just heard a student from Fangcao say that if you learn 'Shulihua' well, you can dominate the world. Is that true?"

Dong Yizhi was stunned for a moment before he understood. He laughed and said, "It's 'learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry well, and you can go anywhere in the world.'"

Huang Binkun said, "Is this 'Shulihua' really that powerful?"

Dong Yizhi said, "Of course. Building ships and houses, opening roads and bridges, and fighting wars—how can you do without mathematics, physics, and chemistry?"

Huang Binkun thought to himself that this "Shulihua" must be the Australian secret art. He heard Yuanlao Dong continue, "But even if you are good at mathematics, physics, and chemistry, your 'three views' must also be correct." Seeing Huang Binkun's blank expression, Yuanlao Dong explained, "The 'three views' are the world view, the view of life, and the view of values." Only then did he see a look of understanding on Huang Binkun's face.

In fact, what Huang Binkun was thinking was that the髡-haired bandits' secret arts followed the Daoist methods. The "Ten Commandments Temple," the "Human Life Temple," and the "Jiazhi Temple" must be three extremely important Daoist temples of the Australians. He must visit them in the future to find out the truth.

Huang Binkun asked again, "I have also heard that students have to practice the incantations of 'Shulihua' every day, not only reciting them but also repeatedly copying them."

Yuanlao Dong smiled and said, "Those are not incantations, they are formulas. Formulas have universality and can solve all kinds of problems in the world. They are very important."

Huang Binkun's heart leaped with joy. This "formula incantation" must be the key to the髡-haired bandits' secret arts and spell-casting. So he humbly asked for guidance, "I wonder if the Yuanlao could draw... oh, bestow a few formulas?"

Dong Yizhi thought to himself, *What do you want this for? Have you really been enlightened after just one visit?* He took out his notebook and casually wrote down a few mathematical and physical formulas for him. Huang Binkun took the paper and looked at it over and over again. He then asked, "I wonder which one is the most powerful?"

Dong Yizhi casually pointed to one and said, "This one. This one is the most important."

Huang Binkun felt as if he had found a treasure. He carefully hid the formula paper, preparing to take it home to study carefully.

That night, Huang Binkun sat at his desk in the dormitory and painstakingly practiced the Australian "incantations." After copying more than ten pages, he felt that something was wrong. He slapped his head and sighed, "Alas, I completely forgot that the髡-haired bandits need to use an Australian pen to draw their talismans and cast their spells, and they must write from left to right."

So he immediately went to the school's small shop to buy an Australian charcoal pencil and began to copy the formulas in the "Australian calligraphy" style. However, his years of habit of writing from right to left and from top to bottom made him very uncomfortable. He couldn't help but curse as he wrote, "The Analects say 'disheveled hair and robes folding to the left.' These髡-haired bandits have short hair and write from the left. They have truly become barbarians after staying overseas for so long."

But although he wrote the "incantations" well, he still couldn't figure out how to speak this "Shulihua." He would have to wait for Huang Ping to come back and ask him.

The tour group's trip came to its last day. Although they had only stayed for two nights, most of the members were already eager to return home.

In this Australian school, the impression left on them was that they were "uncultured." Even the things that the lowest-level primary school students were learning were often completely incomprehensible to them, which made the scholars feel very hurt. Their worries about their future prospects made them unable to spare any thought for a critical spirit.

Chinese scholars have always regarded "excelling in learning to become an official" as their ultimate life goal. When they discovered that their "bellies full of classics" were not the content for selecting "scholars" by the Australians, they were all panicked.

Although what they had learned met the standards for selecting officials in the Great Ming, these scholars knew very well that, given the literary style of their own county, it was uncertain whether a Jinshi would emerge even in another hundred years. Producing a few Juren would be enough to be recorded in the county gazetteer.

Now, with the Australians, this nouveau riche, whether they wanted to seize the throne or rule Hainan as a separate state, it was a new opportunity for the disillusioned scholars. If they could latch on early, it would not be a problem to get an official position in the new dynasty. There were quite a few people in the tour group who intended to climb the ladder, and their visit to Fangcao was also to probe the Australians' standards for selecting officials.

Now, the Australians' learning was completely different from theirs. Their only advantage over these students was that they knew more characters and could write poetry.

As a result, these few people tried their best to build a relationship with Yuanlao Dong, who often came out to entertain them, to see if they could have a chance to learn "Australian studies."

Yuanlao Dong smiled and expressed his gratitude, but he said that Fangcao currently only taught children and did not have classes for adults. The only class for adults at present was the literacy teacher training class. If they were interested, they could sign up to be literacy teachers in the purification camps, and then they would have the opportunity to participate in specialized training.

When these words were spoken, the enthusiasm of the crowd cooled considerably. It was not that there were no scholars who went to the purification camps to be literacy teachers, but they were all students who could not enter the official schools, out-of-work clerks, and at best, down-and-out poor scholars. For them, who were after all respectable scholars, to be associated with this group was really a loss of face.
