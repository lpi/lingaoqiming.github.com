They stared at each other in silence. Ran Yao's eyes scanned the man, and then he saw itâ€”an inconspicuous red smudge on his cuff. He grabbed the man's arm. Guo Yi, startled, tried to struggle, but was quickly subdued.

Ran Yao scraped the mark with his fingernail, brought it to his nose, and sniffed. A strange smile played on his lips. "A woman," he said. It was lipstick.

"Report to the Executive Committee," he ordered. "We have a stowaway. There is at least one more, a female, on board. They may be armed."

The news sent a ripple of alarm through the command structure. A full search of the camp and the ships was ordered. The two ATF agents were found huddled in a storage compartment deep in the ship's hold. They surrendered without a fight.

The agents, hungry and demoralized, were cooperative. They recounted their investigation, from the gun purchases in North America to their clandestine boarding of the *Fengcheng*. Xue Ziliang, ever the pragmatist, even tried to negotiate, offering a large reward for their release.

Ran Yao just shook his head. "A tempting offer, but no one here has the ability to collect it."

"Are you afraid?" Xue Ziliang asked with a shrug. "The US government can protect you."

"I have no doubt of that," Ran Yao replied. "The problem is, the US government does not yet exist."

Xue Ziliang whistled. "I see. We're in Chinese territory." He gave a sly smile. "Or maybe not."

"Do you know what day it is?"

"October 28th, 2009."

"Wrong," Ran Yao said, a strange pity in his eyes. "Today is the first day of the ninth lunar month in the year 1628. You have arrived in another time."

The two Americans looked at him as if he were insane, then exchanged a mysterious smile.

"I knew it," Ran Yao muttered.

In the ship's conference room, the contents of the stowaways' pockets were spread across a table: passports, IDs, pistols... a collection of artifacts from a lost world.

"So this is the legendary Section X," [Wen Desi][y002] said, picking up Guo Yi's credentials.

"He's a tough one," Ran Yao said with a note of admiration. "Refuses to say a word."

"And the Americans?"

"They sang like canaries. They were here investigating the North American branch."

"Their reasons are irrelevant now," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said. "They can't go back. The question is, what do we do with them?"

"They are useful talents," Dr. Zhong Lishi said, his voice a low drawl. "We should absorb them into our ranks."

"Guo Yi is one of our own. He can be... re-educated. But the Americans?"

"One of them is Chinese," someone pointed out.

"An ABC. He doesn't identify with us."

"Who will he identify with here?" [Wang Luobin][y003] said with a laugh. "The 17th-century English? The Dutch? We are the representatives of advanced civilization. He will have to identify with us, whether he wants to or not."

"New York is just a village right now, isn't it?"

"The Dutch acquired Manhattan two years ago," Yu E'shui, the historian, interjected. "It's called New Amsterdam."

"[Ma Qianzhu][y005]" nodded. "I agree. We can use them. They are trained law enforcement officers. They could strengthen our own security forces."

Ran Yao was in full agreement. He even suggested recruiting the police officer from the family they had accidentally brought with them.

"You all talk a good game," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a sigh. "But they still think we're a cult. Who would be willing to work for a group of lunatics?"

"We need proof," [Wang Luobin][y003] said. "No cell phone signal?"

"There are places in the world with no signal."

"No GPS?"

"Jamming."

"The beacon tower?"

"A fake."

"The Ming Dynasty furniture?"

"A clever reproduction."

"I've tried all of it," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, his hands spread in a gesture of helplessness.

It was Yu E'shui who offered a solution. "Let them go."

"Let them go?" The room was stunned into silence.

"Yes. Let them see for themselves. Hearing is deceptive, seeing is believing. The situation is beyond their comprehension. If it were me, I wouldn't believe it either. Let the facts speak for themselves."

"But what if something happens to them? They're old and young. They haven't been vaccinated."

"Revolution requires sacrifice," Yu E'shui said, a strange glint in his eyes. "If they are unwilling to be our fellow travelers, their fate is their own."

"We can release all seven of them together," Wu De suggested with a chuckle. "They'll stick together at first. But when the reality of their situation sets in, they'll fall apart."

Zhong Lishi objected. "This group is a collection of protagonists from a dozen different transmigration novels. If they stick together, they could become a rival power."

Wu De smiled. "Impossible. What common goal do they share? We came here with a unified purpose. They are a random collection of individuals. At the first sign of hardship, they will turn on each other."

"After they've had their fill of arguing, they will come back to us," he continued. "And then, they will be ours."

"What if they're captured by the Ming? Or killed?"

"Why would they kill such strange and valuable specimens?" Wu De replied. "The Ming officials are not savages. A little suffering will make them more pliable. And if they are truly unlucky... well, that is fate."

"A good idea," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said. "We'll check their belongings, keep what we need, and issue them some basic rations."

"No," Wu De interrupted. "We will be generous. Give them back everything. A show of good faith. Let them see that we are not their enemies."

"And if they leak our secrets?"

"To whom? They think we are lunatics. The Ming officials will think the same."

Guo Yi was given a meal of steamed buns and pickled vegetables. He was then taken to a cabin where Xue Ziliang was ravenously devouring the same meal. Sarlina, pale and haggard, picked at a bun, her appetite gone.

"Guo, what did they ask you?" Xue Ziliang asked, his mouth full.

"They asked. I said nothing."

"Sorry, Guo. We told them everything."

"I know," Guo Yi replied, his voice flat. "Your policy on capture is very humane." He was no longer concerned with interrogation. He was concerned with survival.

"Are you scared?" Xue Ziliang asked.

"A little," Guo Yi admitted. "What do you make of these people?"

Xue Ziliang lit a cigarette, his lighter having been confiscated. He held it under his nose, inhaling the scent of the unlit tobacco. "I don't think they mean us any harm."

"What?"

"The man who interrogated us," he said, his voice low, "he tried to convince us that the year is 1628."

Guo Yi stared at him, dumbfounded.

"Sarlina said he's not crazy. She has a master's in psychology. She can tell."

"Cults," Guo Yi said. "They're not crazy either."

"Exactly. I think this organization has a bit of a cult flavor to it." Xue Ziliang leaned closer. "Have you ever heard of the Church of Survival? An underground organization, preparing for the end of the world. Their leader, a man named Wen-ster, is constantly preaching about the coming apocalypse."

"And the cargo list we saw," he continued. "As trade goods, it's nonsensical. But as the building blocks for a new civilization..."

"Are you saying..."

"Yes," Xue Ziliang said, his eyes wide with a dawning, terrible understanding. "I think we've stumbled into a massive scam. Someone has fabricated a new world."
