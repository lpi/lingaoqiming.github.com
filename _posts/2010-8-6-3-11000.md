"You're worse than an animal!" Zhao Dachong deliberately roared.

By now, there were seven or eight people, men and women, standing in the room. In the chaos, Xin Nachun threw herself into Zhao Dachong's arms, crying desperately, but without tears.

"I can't live anymore!" she cried out, and then began to sob again.

Liu Si struggled to his feet, stunned for a moment, then turned to run. The doorway was blocked, and he couldn't escape.

"Where do you think you're going?" Zhao Dachong grabbed him and slapped him several times across the face. As he hit him, he cursed, "How dare you defile my, Zhao Dachong's, intended wife! And a virgin at that! You raped a virgin! You look like a human, but you have the heart of a beast!"

As the chaos reached its peak, the people in the room parted to the sides. Zhao Haiji had arrived.

Zhao Dachong deliberately said, "Eighth Uncle, this is the fine guest you invited! He actually dared to rape your nephew's wife!"

Xin Nachun sobbed and wailed, "Eighth Uncle, you've ruined me. I have no face to live anymore, boo hoo hoo..."

Zhao Haiji feigned surprise and exclaimed, "Oh!" as if he were greatly shocked.

After a while, Zhao Haiji slowly said to Liu Si, "I treated you as a respectable person, invited you to a banquet, and asked you to speak up for us, to plead for us. It would have been fine if you didn't want to, but how could you be so beastly as to rape a commoner's daughter? In any dynasty, this is a crime against the law! Do you understand?" At this point, he glared and shouted, "Men!"

"Here," a half-grown boy stepped forward.

"Tie him up and take him to the ancestral hall to be handed over to the work team. I want to see how their 'protecting the territory and pacifying the people' is actually 'pacifying the people'!" With that, Zhao Haiji stepped into the inner room. Zhao Dachong followed him.

Liu Si was bound hand and foot and pushed into the inner room. As soon as he entered, someone kicked him in the back of the knees, and he fell to his knees.

"Tell me, what should be done for raping a commoner's daughter?" Zhao Haiji asked deliberately. Zhao Dachong viciously waved a staff in front of Liu Si's eyes and said in a gruff voice, "What should be done? By rights, attempting to rape a woman is punishable by death. But since he's from the work team, we'll hang him up and give him a beating, then send him to the work team to be dealt with! If they don't deal with him, we'll send him to the county yamen!"

Liu Si was sweating all over with fear and quickly begged for mercy. He said he had drunk too much and was overcome by lust. He pleaded for a long time and was finally spared a beating.

When Zhao Haiji saw that the time was right, he said to Zhao Dachong, "Nephew, you go out first. Eighth Uncle will definitely give you an explanation."

Zhao Dachong snorted pretentiously and went out.

After everyone had left, Zhao Haiji called for a scribe. "Get paper and a brush, and write down everything he says."

The scribe had paper, a brush, ink, and an inkstone ready and began to write on the kang table.

"It's written. Read it to him," Zhao Haiji said.

The scribe read, "I, Liu Si, after a banquet, broke into the home of the commoner Zhao Dachong, encountered the commoner's daughter Xin Nachun, and attempted to rape her by force. The woman was unwilling, and I tore her clothes in an attempt to rape her. This is true."

Liu Si argued, "I didn't do it on purpose..."

"You didn't intentionally tear a young girl's clothes?" Zhao Haiji said. Liu Si was speechless. This was not a Hongmen Banquet, but a trap.

Zhao Haiji asked again, "Do you want to settle this privately or publicly?"

"Privately! Privately," Liu Si certainly knew what that meant.

If he chose to settle it publicly, he would be taken to the ancestral hall on the spot. Not only would he lose all face, but the two superiors, Du and Dong, would also be disgraced. His future in the transmigrator group would be completely ruined.

"You're a smart man! Men, untie him!" Zhao Haiji smiled triumphantly. This Miss Xin was really useful. "To settle it privately, put your handprint on this confession."

Liu Si had no choice but to press his handprint on the paper. Zhao Haiji folded the paper and tucked it into his sleeve. His expression immediately changed. "Fourth Master Liu, you've been frightened." He cupped his hands in a salute.

Liu Si said nothing. With his intelligence, he was well aware of the other party's scheme.

Zhao Haiji drank his tea and said slowly, "We're in the same boat now." He paused, looked at Liu Si's face, and shouted, "Men!"

Someone from outside had already brought in a small official's box with red lacquer and copper-bound corners, about the size of a woman's jewelry box. It was heavy in the hand and had a small lock on it.

Zhao Haiji took a key from his sleeve and opened the lock. "Fourth Master Liu, this is a small token of my appreciation. Please accept it as a small apology." He opened the box, and the dim little room was immediately filled with a brilliant light.

Inside the box were all kinds of jewelry, either gold or silver: from hairpins to anklets; from a bride's headdress to a child's locket. There were all sorts of styles, some inlaid with pearls, jadeite, and precious stones. The dazzling display left Liu Si speechless.

He had never seen so many fine things in his life! Liu Si's hands began to tremble. He quickly refused, "I can't accept this, it's too valuable..."

"Don't be ungrateful," Zhao Haiji's face hardened.

Liu Si had no choice but to accept it.

"You can keep the things with the widow Zhou," Zhao Haiji said with a smile. "Don't worry, my men will take good care of her. She's climbed up the social ladder."

Seeing Liu Si's dazed and absent-minded expression, he added, "You don't have to be afraid. Since Fourth Master Liu is so loyal to us, we are not ungrateful people either."

"Yes, yes," Liu Si finally caught his breath.

Zhao Haiji leaned closer and whispered, "If you do something for us... The work team has been whispering about something these days. What are they talking about? You tell us everything. There will be more benefits for you in the future. I give you my word!"

Liu Si had no choice but to say, "Since you gentlemen have taken such good care of me, I will be at your service from now on!"

Zhao Haiji said, "Alright, you go back first. If there's anything in the future, we'll send a message to you at the widow Zhou's house."

A few days later, the whole plan seemed to be going smoothly. Although Old Man Mei was still listless, he could still reveal something when pressed. From Old Man Mei, Zhao Dachong learned that the two female officials were very dissatisfied with the current situation and often quarreled. The red-haired monk was nothing special, just "preaching" all day long and teaching everyone to sing some songs.

Zhao Haiji secretly met with Liu Si at the widow Zhou's house. From him, he indeed got more important news.

"The Australians' bandit suppression is expanding," Liu Si said to the impatient Zhao Haiji after he had eaten and drunk his fill at the widow Zhou's house, dropping a bombshell. "The troops are all moving towards Danzhou."

Zhao Haiji's interest was piqued. "So, this area is about to quiet down?"

"Yes," Liu Si glanced outside and lowered his voice. "The higher-ups are not satisfied with the work of the two women and are going to send a man to take over."

"Yes, yes," Zhao Haiji listened carefully and asked, "What's this man like?"

"I'm not too clear about that," Liu Si said. "The female official surnamed Du has been in a bad mood every night for the past few days, arguing with the one surnamed Dong. The two of them are at odds, probably because of this."

This matched the news from Old Man Mei, and Zhao Haiji was convinced.

"...These few days, the guards are packing their luggage. The new captain will probably arrive in a few days. We'll have to send a few people to escort the two women back. It's really a hassle."

Zhao Haiji's eyelids twitched. That's right, if they were to send the two women back, they certainly wouldn't let them travel alone. They would definitely send some people to escort them. This was a great opportunity—the ancestral hall would be short of troops.

"How many people are going?"

"About six or seven," Liu Si said, seeing the glint in his eyes. "What? Are you—"

"It's nothing, it's nothing!" Zhao Haiji said quickly. He had to discuss this with Zhao Dachong immediately. This was a great opportunity that couldn't be missed.

That night, Zhao Dachong and Zhao Haiji discussed the matter. They decided that Zhao Dachong would go to find Zhao Haixie and Xin Nari himself to discuss the matter and bring the troops back.

"It is indeed a good opportunity! But for this to succeed, we still need Liu Si to put in some effort," Xin Nari said, nodding after hearing the news brought by Zhao Dachong, who had rushed over during the night.

"How so?" Zhao Dachong asked.

"The matter of the gunpowder!" Xin Nari said. "Even if five or six of them leave, there will still be more than a dozen. If they start shooting, we'll still be in trouble." Zhao Haixie had been tormented by the transmigrator army and had a direct understanding of the power of their firearms.

"Let Liu Si cooperate from the inside. I just don't know if this kid has the guts!"

"We have a handle on him, are you afraid he won't do it?" Zhao Haixie said.

"It's useless," Xin Nari shook his head. "Liu Si is only afraid of a piece of paper. It's fine if you ask him to pass on a message, but if you ask him to do something that will get him beheaded, he won't do it. He'll sell us out in a heartbeat!"

"Then what should we do?" Zhao Dachong became anxious.

"Under a great reward, there must be a brave man!" Xin Nari waved his hand. "How much money and property is there still in the village that we can use?"

"We still have to give him money?" Zhao Dachong almost shouted. "We already gave him a box of jewelry last time!" He was reluctant to take out the money for his own reasons. Zhao Haiqing was Dang Namen's "general manager," and he was in charge of the gang's money, grain, and supplies. After the mountain stronghold was broken, the bulk of their savings was gone, but there was still a lot of property hidden in Daolu Village. Although this property was not under Zhao Dachong's control, he had long known the hiding place and the specific amount from his father. He regarded this wealth as his own capital and had been keeping this secret, unwilling to take it out easily. Although Zhao Dachong was arrogant, he was not stupid. Xin Nari now had men and connections in the greenwood. If he wanted to be the leader of the gang, or at least a major leader, he had to hold on to this wealth.

Xin Nari knew his plan all along. But right now, the gang was destitute, and only Zhao Dachong still had some property. He had to try his best to persuade him.
