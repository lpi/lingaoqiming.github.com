If I could secure a supply of these many candies in Italy, opening a shop dedicated to the nobility and high officials would likely make me rich. But here, the price of candy is remarkably low. Mr. Gonzales, out of curiosity, spent a single real and bought a large bag full of assorted candies. The candies were packed in small, waxed paper bags, which were very exquisite. The shop even gave us a woven straw bag to hold them, and this bag alone could be considered a work of art.

The most peculiar of their leisure products is their tobacco—as you surely know, this plant from the New World is currently popular all over the world. People have invented various ways to use it. But in Lingao, there is a new way to enjoy tobacco. They sell it in long paper rolls. White paper is rolled into delicate tubes, as thick as a pen, and filled evenly with shredded tobacco. They call them "tobacco rolls." Smokers often use a hollow tube of bamboo, wood, or cardboard attached to the roll to smoke, to avoid burning their lips when the roll is about to burn out.

The tobacco rolls are sold in paper packs or boxes of ten or twenty, with various colors and patterns. Although each roll looks the same to us, the price varies greatly depending on the color and pattern of the packaging. The most expensive box can buy about ten of the cheapest. Neither Mr. Gonzales nor I could find a reasonable explanation for this. To us, apart from the packaging, there seemed to be no obvious difference between them.

The currency used here is a type of paper money called "circulation coupons." Marco Polo once said that the Tartars used paper money in China. I have always been very skeptical of this—because no one in the world loves silver more than the Chinese—except for a very small number of goods, the Chinese always want the Company to pay in silver. But in Lingao, they do use paper money. The printing is exquisite, with complex and fine patterns. Especially on the background of the pattern, there are extremely fine background patterns drawn with lines. Even as a painter, I feel that I am not capable of such delicate drawing. As for what method they use to print the patterns in layers on the paper, it is even more of a mystery. Apparently, they have very skilled copperplate engravers.

All the shops here accept paper money. Of course, the shopkeepers are also happy to accept our reals, but when giving change, they can only give back paper money. For this reason, we had to buy things worth exactly one real each time, to avoid getting a pile of paper money that would be worthless outside this place. This way of shopping meant we ended up returning laden with goods.

We lingered in every shop. Each one was an eye-opener. I can well understand why the Company is so eager to send commercial agents here. Lingao is also a treasure trove of trade, with many novel goods that we have never seen or heard of.

There are even shops here that sell ready-made clothes—this is truly surprising. Without a tailor to take measurements, how can they make clothes that fit? Although the Australians' clothing is very simple and shabby by our standards. Their clothes are not made of wool, silk, or leather, but only cheap Indian or Chinese cotton and linen. The style of the clothes is only slightly better than that of the natives in Batavia. At the banquet celebrating the trade agreement, the Australian elders in attendance were almost uniformly dressed in these crude and simple clothes—such a custom is truly difficult to understand.

The clothes sold in the ready-to-wear shops have no style to speak of. It is said that this is the standard attire for the Australians and their subjects. Apart from certain details, they are almost completely identical, and even the colors are limited to a few: black, gray, blue, and brown.

Regarding the Australians and their subjects, this is what I have observed.

The Australians have clear requirements for their subjects, which is to dress like them: men cut their hair very short, while women have short hair. Both men and women wear "Australian-style" clothing, which is what I mentioned before—the simple clothing worn by all Australians, high and low, which they call "uniforms."

Whether it's the native troops trained by the Australians, the workers they employ, the farmers who labor for them, the business personnel, or others, they all wear the same style of clothing without distinction. Certain groups, like the army, have slightly different attire. Others use various decorations, markings, and special equipment to distinguish themselves—similar to our heraldry.

Just as we saw special policemen on duty on the streets at night, their clothing was exactly the same as that sold in the ready-made clothing stores. A conical hat, white leggings, a small piece of cloth at the collar, and a cloth badge on the chest distinguished him from others. Of course, he also had a short wooden stick as a weapon.

By adopting such a method, I believe the only advantage is that it facilitates mass production. Apparently, the Australians feel they have an obligation to provide clothing for all their subjects. To provide clothing for tens of thousands of people, the style of the clothing must be simplified as much as possible to facilitate manufacturing.

As for why they provide uniform clothing for their subjects, I have not figured this out. At first, we guessed it might be so that the Australians could distinguish their subjects from the local Chinese at a glance—after all, they all have Chinese faces. However, this was refuted after Mr. Gonzales had no difficulty buying a suit of the same style in a clothing store. Apparently, anyone can buy this ugly and simple clothing. And the people we saw in Dongmen Market still had many wearing traditional Chinese clothing and their hair in topknots.

Putting aside the reasons we cannot understand, the obvious reason should be that the Australians like neatness and uniformity. This can be seen from their regulation of their subjects' attire, and not only that. The various buildings we saw in Dongmen Market also revealed a sense of neatness. Although from the outside, these buildings, which are close together, are well-arranged and of different heights. But from the details, all the buildings are built according to an almost identical pattern. In my opinion, all the buildings in Dongmen Market are constructed from the same structures and dimensions in different forms.

The Australians make extensive use of completely identical building materials. Fired bricks are their most commonly used building material. The main material of all buildings is fired brick. They are mostly red, but also some are grey. The texture is solid and fine, obviously the result of high-temperature firing. I carefully observed several buildings along the street. They generally use three different sizes of bricks. The parts where each type of brick is used are different, but the same principle of use is followed in every building. The windows, doors, steps, and railings they use on the buildings can, according to my observation, be classified into several completely identical types. Apparently, these building accessories are mass-produced in some workshop according to a few fixed sizes and geometric shapes, rather than being made on-site by a craftsman. Using this method should speed up the construction of houses. It must be by using this method that the Australians have been able to build a prosperous city here in just a few years.

Unlike the Chinese or European buildings I have seen, the houses in Dongmen Market have almost no decoration. Whether it's the roof, eaves, or walls, you can't see any trace of carving, sculpture, or murals. The walls are simply painted white or black, and some have exposed brick walls. In Batavia and along the coast of China, I have seen that the Chinese love to carve various detailed bas-reliefs or apply various colorful paintings on the beams and pillars of their houses, but here the wooden structures are only coated with a single, simple layer of lacquer.

There is a peculiar sense of uniformity here. After discovering the characteristics of the buildings, I suddenly realized that many things in Dongmen Market are the same: the streetlights, the trash baskets, the road signs... even the people walking on the street are very similar. It is a feeling I cannot describe.

Our walk was very pleasant. No one bothered us on the street, and the shopkeepers were very friendly. We discovered a holy church in Dongmen Market—which was a delightful surprise. You know, in Batavia, the fanatical Puritans do not allow us to pray and force us to hold their services. Now, in Lingao under the rule of the Australians, there is actually a church of the Holy Church.

This church, from its appearance, is both simple and elegant. More importantly, it is relatively 'non-standard'. Its shape reminds me of the small churches in the small towns back home. The church door was open, and bright light shone from the doors and windows—it was a holy light that warmed us. We immediately went inside.

...

Wu Shimang was yawning endlessly, but he had to maintain a serious expression. He was supervising John Dermot, a novice from Ireland, painting a mural on the wall. The Dongmen Market church had recently been renovated—the Taoist priest Daoquanzi had recently restored an old, abandoned temple in Lingao County, held a grand opening ceremony, and it had become the official headquarters of the New Taoism. This made him feel a sense of competition, so he was paying close attention to both hardware and software improvements. The Dongmen Market church had not been built long ago, so it was impossible to tear it down and rebuild it, but Director Wu felt that the interior of the church was still too simple and lacked appeal. The arrival of Jin Lige and others gave him free decorators. Painting murals, installing stained glass, and using tiles for interior decoration were all put on the agenda. Shortly after arriving in Lingao, Father Jin and his apprentice were put to work painting murals and decorating the interior of the entire monastery.

These two priests were busy from morning to night painting murals, sculpting plaster statues, and even reluctantly participating in the creation of stained glass windows—of course, this was not only for religious service; the Propaganda and Construction departments also needed new art forms to serve their respective purposes.
