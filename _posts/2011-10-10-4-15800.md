Chen Haiyang established three outposts on Lantau Island. One was built on the southern coast of Lantau, directly controlling the "Three Gates"—the fleet would use this as an anchorage for the invasion of the Pearl River.

The second outpost was set up at Kap Shui Mun, in the northeast of Lantau. It faced Ma Wan Island and was the western exit of Victoria Harbour, a crucial channel from the South China Sea to the Pearl River Estuary. Shortly after the task force landed on Hong Kong Island, a secret observation post had been stationed here. Now, Chen Haiyang officially designated it as an outpost to constantly monitor this important location.

The last one was built on Tai O Island.

Tai O was the earliest developed village on Lantau Island. It was not only the main population center but also had salt pans, once being the main salt supplier for Hong Kong. Historically, it was famous for salt production and smuggling.

The island is extremely close to the main island of Lantau, so close that the strait between them could be crossed by a simple ferry. Its maritime geographical position was very advantageous. The Portuguese had once attempted to establish a colony on Tai O Island as a trading port with China. But with their defeat in the Battle of Tuen Mun, this attempt was completely thwarted.

Now, the Aussies had arrived.

Shi Zhiqi and his marines took a motorboat to Tai O Island. Most of the villagers in Tai O were Tanka people. The Tanka were all fishermen and sailors, and many of them were pirates or engaged in piracy on the side. Some of the local villagers were among the pirates who had been killed or captured. Now, hearing that the Kun thieves who had annihilated Zheng Bao's great gang had arrived, they were terrified. But no one dared to resist. After an urgent consultation, they chose several village elders to greet them.

"The houses here look a bit like those of ethnic minorities," Shi Zhiqi commented, looking at the stilt houses built half on land and half in the water.

Le Lin said, "These are stilt houses. It's a local feature. Tai O is called the Venice of Hong Kong. It's a must-visit place when you come to Lantau. The seafood is excellent."

The topic of seafood did not arouse any interest among the Elders. Eating seafood had become a normal part of life for them.

The marines brought the village envoys. The Tanka people's clothing and dialect were quite different from the local Cantonese. Of course, Shi Zhiqi couldn't understand them, but there were quite a few Tanka people in the Lingao regime's navy, so they were soon able to communicate.

The envoys presented gifts: fifty taels of silver and some scattered gold and silver, as a sign of submission. Shi Zhiqi said some polite words and ordered the gifts to be accepted. He stated that they would not disturb the local villages. As long as they obediently followed the orders of the Aussie Song regime, their safety would be protected.

The residents of Lantau Island, whether Cantonese, Hoklo, Hakka, or Tanka, were mostly fishermen, boatmen, and sailors. Chen Haiyang knew that, according to historical research, they had been living a life of half-pirate, half-fisherman in these waters since the 10th century. Generally speaking, pirates were also excellent sailors. Although the local residents had the problem of "communicating with bandits," they were an excellent source of naval recruits. Moreover, he currently lacked the strength to carry out "civil reform" here. Therefore, his guiding policy on local civil matters was lenient. He did not take harsh measures against the villagers of Lantau and the surrounding islands, to avoid excessive hostility. He only demanded that each village hand over the scattered pirates. Of course, they would certainly not hand over their own relatives and fellow villagers, but they would not be so polite to outsiders.

On Shi Zhiqi's orders, the villages on Tai O Island appointed liaisons, who were required to go to Hong Kong Island for meetings every ten days. There was also the so-called "reasonable burden," which included the supply of fish and seafood, as well as the unpaid conscription of labor and boats. This policy was extended to all villages on Lantau Island.

The outpost on Tai O Island was built at a place the villagers called "Fan Kwai Tong" (Foreign Devil's Pond). This was originally where the Portuguese had built a fortress, preparing to open a trading port. Traces of the Portuguese from over a hundred years ago could still be seen: stones and rubble from the fortress and buildings, rusted ironware, and even some shipwrecks among the reefs.

A few days later, [Wen Desi][y002], Chen Haiyang, and others, leading the task force's troops and civil cadres, set up an altar on the beach at Tung Chung and held a grand ceremony facing the sea to worship Emperor Duanzong of the Song Dynasty. During the last stormy days of the Great Song, the small Southern Song court had twice been to Lantau Island and had briefly stayed at Tung Chung. It was said that Emperor Duanzong had also died somewhere on the north shore of Lantau. Since the Lingao regime claimed to be descendants of Yashan, this act helped to display its "legitimacy."

A company of army infantry stood in a square formation. Twelve special service boats were lined up in the harbor. The Elders were all respectful. Although there was no kowtowing, they all bowed three times at a ninety-degree angle. Then, [Wen Desi][y002] read out the sacrificial text. This text was said to have been written by a talented scholar from the Senate, with a bachelor's degree in Chinese from a university and a master's degree in history. It was not only a piece of parallel prose but also contained many obscure characters that required consulting the Kangxi Dictionary. [Wen Desi][y002] stumbled through the reading, and the ceremony was finally completed with great difficulty.

After the ceremony, the entire army fired three volleys, followed by three cannon shots from the special service boats in the bay. For a time, thick smoke billowed, and the scene was impressive.

The Battle of Lantau completely eliminated the觊觎 of other pirate gangs on the Pearl River basin. Since even Liu Xiang avoided the Aussies, and the reckless Zheng Bao had been utterly destroyed, everyone had a further understanding of the strength of the Kun thieves or the Aussies. As a result, the pirates in this area almost completely disappeared.

Geographically, Hong Kong Island, Lantau Island, and the mainland form an almost enclosed inland sea. This inland sea was now completely controlled by the task force. The Ming navy at Tuen Mun and Nantou made no move to challenge the Aussies' sea power. The naval patrols from Nantou garrison were also canceled.

Another result of the Battle of Lantau was that Chen Haiyang had to postpone the full-scale operation into the Pearl River Estuary. He had too many spoils of victory to digest. The prisoners and captured ships filled Base 852, and he needed more food, craftsmen, and soldiers to cope.

So he requested further reinforcements from Lingao; otherwise, the task force's strength would not be sufficient to handle both the construction of Hong Kong Island and the harassment operations in the Pearl River. Just the 2,000 prisoners and several hundred immigrants from Lantau would require at least one company to guard them.

The army volunteered to send two infantry companies. Although the navy was not happy about the army's intervention, Hong Kong Island was unlikely to be a naval monopoly, and the army's reinforcements could at least share their operational pressure.

With the arrival of the army, civil and engineering personnel also arrived in a steady stream with the supply boats. They built a pier, a simple shipyard, warehouses, and barracks. They installed steam engines and expanded the purification camp with prefabricated building kits—once completed, the camp would be able to accommodate 5,000 people.

Chen Haiyang ordered the sailors to step up the repair of the ships captured from the pirates—especially the small, shallow-draft sampans and "long dragons," which would be very useful in landing operations in the inland waterways. With these small boats, soldiers could be transported to almost any location for landing without worrying about water depth.

The entire Hong Kong Island base became a hive of activity, with noisy construction sites and workers everywhere. In the bay near Hong Kong Island, steam-powered motor patrol boats were patrolling menacingly, reminding everyone who was the master of these waters.

Chen Haiyang's naval strength was further increased. Four Type II single-masted patrol boats were allocated to him from Lingao. These were newly launched improved iron-ribbed wooden-hulled ships, a design that balanced Lingao's current industrial production capacity and material supply capabilities. Each ship's tonnage was increased to 150 tons and was equipped with 18 cannons. Although these ships were not very suitable for operations in complex inland waterways like the Pearl River, they were absolute weapons for controlling the Pearl River Estuary. They could effectively monitor the various strategic maritime points around Hong Kong Island, which allowed him to free up enough forces for operations in the Pearl River.

For the operation into the Pearl River Estuary, he designated five squadrons of 20 special service boats, one squadron of single-masted patrol boats, and one squadron of motorboats. There was also a temporarily formed "small boat brigade" using captured pirate sampans and "long dragons." About a dozen of the large ships captured from the pirates, after being fumigated, were put into service. Chen Haiyang equipped them with sailors and marines and made some minor modifications. These ships would mainly serve as transport vessels, used to carry captured supplies and prisoners during the operation.

Chen Haiyang sent out survey ships, escorted by patrol boats, to the Pearl River Estuary in advance to conduct actual measurements of water depth and terrain—the 21st-century nautical charts were obviously very different from the actual conditions of the 17th century. Chen Haiyang did not want any ships to run aground before the battle even started—it would damage his and the navy's reputation.

Everything that was happening at Base 852 was, of course, not hidden from the Ming coastal outposts. Although they did not react in any practical way, the alarm that the Kun thieves were about to launch a large-scale invasion quickly reached Guangzhou and Zhaoqing.

Although the situation in Zhaoqing was in a state of no war, no peace, in the governor's yamen in Guangzhou, the matter of negotiating with the Aussies was in full swing. The one leading the peace talks was the Governor of Guangdong, Li Fengjie. Shortly after receiving the news of the military defeat, he quickly summoned his advisors and trusted officials to secretly discuss countermeasures. Everyone agreed that Guangdong must quickly distance itself from this defeat. Of course, the report to the throne had to be sent quickly.

Li Fengjie's grand sedan chair was carried through the main street, which was almost entirely lined with government offices. There were usually few pedestrians on the street, mostly clerks and yamen runners from the various government offices and the servants of officials. It was summer, and the afternoon was hot, so the street was even more deserted.
