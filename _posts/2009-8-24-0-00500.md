This is the grand finale of "Lingao Qiming" that I hacked from the author Chui Niu Zhe's computer. Everyone can take a look, but by all means, do not spread it around.

**The Grand Finale of "Lingao Qiming":**

So, the transmigrators finally succeeded in founding their nation and bringing harmony to the whole world. On this day, all the transmigrators gathered, a rare occasion, in the Transmigration Palace, designed by Commissar Ma himself in the style of the Palace of the Soviets. The majestic Transmigration Palace was still empty for now. It was said that because they had underestimated Chief Wen's waistline, the bronze statue made of him was front-heavy, wide in the middle, and narrow at the bottom, and had been sent back to be recast.

However, this did not hinder the transmigrators' celebration feast. All non-transmigrators automatically left after setting up the dining tables, leaving only the transmigrators in the vast hall. The tables were laden with all sorts of exquisite foods imaginable, a dazzling array of gorilla lips, panda paws, cheetah penises, and giant turtle skirts. All kinds of expensive wines gushed from a fountain in the center of the hall. It was truly a scene of debauchery with a pool of wine and a forest of meat. The transmigrators sang and danced, cheering for the perfect success of their ten-year transmigration enterprise. Some, however, thought of their comrades who had fallen along the way and could not help but weep aloud. The hall was a lively scene of chaos.

Amidst the laughter and cheers, only Commissar Ma on the main stage seemed preoccupied. He barely touched the food and wine, and kept pressing his chest. The hard object was still there, and his heart slowly relaxed. Commissar Ma couldn't help but think of the task Chief Wen had personally given him three months ago: to come up with a plan for the distribution of benefits among the transmigrators. Although he couldn't guarantee it would pass with 100% approval, Chief Wen's strict order was that at least 80% of the transmigrators had to agree.

For the past few months, Commissar Ma had spent countless sleepless nights, and his already sparse hair was almost all gone. He had no confidence in how many people would approve the painstaking plan in his breast pocket when he presented it later.

While Ma Qianzhu was still lost in thought, with a loud crash, Xi Yazhou, who had jumped onto a dining table to do a Cossack dance, fell headfirst. Before the crowd could laugh, the sound of tables, chairs, dishes, and chopsticks clattering was heard, and countless people fell to the ground. Someone shouted, "The wine is poisoned!" and the whole place instantly descended into chaos!

Commissar Ma's heart trembled violently. He quickly circulated his true qi, activating the Sunflower Manual. But it would have been better if he hadn't. The moment he circulated his power, his five viscera and six bowels, and all his meridians felt as if they were being twisted by knives, and he spat out a mouthful of purple blood. This poison was incredibly potent. In the time it took to breathe, as far as the eye could see, not a single person in the entire hall could remain standing.

But... but...

But to Eunuch Ma's left, there was still one person standing proudly with his hands behind his back!

"How can it be you?"

That person did not answer. He pressed a corner of the table, and with a whirring sound, the floor of the great hall slowly split open from the middle, revealing a bottomless pit below. As the floorboards retracted, the tables, chairs, and the bodies of the transmigrators rolled down into it.

Commissar Ma, with his profound power, managed to suppress the poison from reaching his heart, so he could still sit upright in his chair, though he couldn't move. Thinking that the great cause of transmigration had fallen into this person's hands, he couldn't help but say hatefully, "I planted countless spies around you, Chief Wen, how could you still pull off such a feat? I... I cannot die in peace!"

Chief Wen let out a long laugh, reached for his neck, and pulled. In his hand appeared a thin human-skin mask, revealing a different, rarely seen fat face.

That fat man grinned sinisterly, "Chief Wen and I have never appeared at the same time. Have you high and mighty experts never noticed?"

Ma Qianzhu's face turned ashen. He spat out another mouthful of blood. Seeing the floor retract to his feet, his consciousness blurring, he could only shout, "So be it! So be it! To die in the Pit of the King of Pits is a fitting end!"

Looking at the empty hall, the fat man let out a bloodcurdling, maniacal laugh. He went forward and tore off the last two characters from the "Celebration Feast" (庆功大会) banner, revealing the character "Tower" (楼) behind it, making it read "Qinggong Tower". From outside the door came the unified shout of "A thousand autumns, ten thousand generations, unify the globe!"...

(End of book)

------------------------

The above is the work of "Eagle from the Sky" (SB multitude)

Below is YYYYY's addition to this ending

Too fast.

Let's learn from Emperor Yongzheng.

First, the revolving heart pot with poisoned wine and poisoned pigeons. Xi Yazhou and a group of others were greedy and ate too much, so they were lost.

Among the rest, some were not poisoned, and some were lightly poisoned.

Then the hidden masters, P-ye? and others, with their pair of treasured palms, fought until they vomited blood and injured the female pirate, but they also succumbed to the poison and died.

Leaving the tower, there was poison smoke, and another batch was lost.

Bei Wei and a group of special forces were lost while breaking through the traps.

.........

In total, there were ten deadly plots.

In the end, the escapees, Xiao Zishan and a few others (the author used his golden finger), but the story was far from over, and the grudges were even further from being settled.

The survivors gathered on a mountain to mourn their dead comrades. At this moment, the light of dawn slowly rose from the sea in the distance. It was Meng De, who had been on a mission outside, returning.

"Amsterdam, I will be back," Xiao Zishan said before leaving.
