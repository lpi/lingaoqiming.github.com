As the moon waxed full, the base shifted into a state of frantic, high-speed operation. The finance department liquidated all remaining assets, converting them into a final torrent of supplies. A small reserve of 500,000 RMB was held back for emergencies, along with ten kilograms of gold, cast into small, easily transportable bars.

All personnel were recalled to the base for final preparations. The medical and health group conducted a final review of the colonists' health, focusing on immunizations. Despite repeated warnings, they discovered a number of individuals who had forged their vaccination records. For some, it was too late to complete the full course of shots. The medical team had no choice but to add more vaccines to their already extensive procurement list.

"Are they gambling with their own lives?" He Ma, the head of the medical group, lamented as he reviewed the list of incomplete immunizations. He knew that 17th-century Hainan would be a paradise for microorganisms. Cholera had been a recurring scourge on the island well into the 20th century.

"Many haven't had corrective eye surgery either," Dr. Lan Fangfang added, his voice tinged with frustration. He was now scrambling to find a full set of old-fashioned optometry equipment, a task that was proving nearly impossible in an age of computerized refractometers.

The procurement of medical supplies was a constant headache. Disposable items were out of the question. Glass syringes, infusion sets, and the small sterilizers that went with them were relics of a bygone era, unearthed from the dusty warehouses of pharmaceutical companies and hospitals. Rubber tubing on old equipment had long since deteriorated, forcing them to commission custom-made replacements at exorbitant cost.

The Executive Committee, however, had given the medical group a blank check. The result was a procurement list that could stock a small hospital: diagnostic equipment, surgical tools, a vast pharmacy of emergency drugs and antibiotics, and a host of other miscellaneous items. They had even tried to purchase a full field hospital set, but to no avail. The committee's obsession with medical preparedness had reached such a fever pitch that the doctors themselves had to intervene, vetoing a proposal to purchase a CT scanner as "useful, but not essential."

The personal equipment issued to each colonist was a testament to the committee's "better to have too much than too little" philosophy. The standard A-Level kit included a modular backpack, military-green training uniforms, combat boots, a boonie hat, a helmet with a mosquito net, goggles, a raincoat, and high-top rubber boots. For protection, they were issued an anti-stab vest, gloves, and a Type 80 steel helmet, chosen for its durability and low cost. Each person also received a walkie-talkie, a survival whistle, a multi-tool, a machete, a compass, a headlamp, a friction-powered flashlight, a windproof lighter, and a full set of mess gear.

Higher-level kits, for military personnel and long-range scouts, included camouflage uniforms, GORE-TEX jackets, and a host of specialized equipment.

Each colonist was allowed 200kg of personal belongings. [Ma Qianzhu][y005], inspecting the packed luggage, shook his head in dismay. Laptops, MP3 players, and PSPs were ubiquitous, as if they were heading to a place with an abundance of power outlets. But essential items like underwear, socks, and toiletries were in short supply. The committee intervened, persuading them to part with their non-essential electronics. Most, however, refused to give up their computers. "It will give us more spare parts," sighed Shi Kai, the head of the IT group.

[Wang Luobin][y003] and the procurement team made a final, frantic dash to nearby cities, purchasing a miscellany of items they had overlooked. The packing and re-packing continued late into the night.

The next morning, they gathered on the training ground, a sea of green-clad figures.

"They look like an army," Xi Yazhou remarked, a note of pride in his voice.

"A disorderly mob," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] grumbled, his eyes scanning the chaotic scene.

"Don't be so cynical, Old Ma," Xi Yazhou said, clapping him on the shoulder. "We are about to sweep across all of China."
