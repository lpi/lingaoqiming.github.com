"Please continue."

"One of them, you know. The second one, however, surprised me a little."

"A woman?"

"You're truly impressive," Xin Wuzui nodded. "You should know who she is by now."

"Yes."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] was shocked. He hadn't expected the situation to evolve like this. *How did she know the list of the Four of the Black?*

He immediately thought of Panpan. This woman had been very close to her recently—although Panpan had not been involved in this case, Ding Ding, as a representative of the propaganda department, had participated in and recorded the entire matter.

It was very likely that Panpan had learned the list of the Four of the Black from Ding Ding.

Another possible source was Mu Min. [Wu Nanhai][y009] had reported to him that her interactions with Mu Min at the café had also been quite close recently.

But [Xiao Zishan][y001] trusted Mu Min's professional ethics. And the Ming family as a whole was "sensible." They were well aware that their origins were not "pure and red," yet now they all held high or key positions. Therefore, they generally kept a low profile, not causing trouble or getting involved in things. [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought it was unlikely that Mu Min would leak secrets.

As for the other Elders she had been close to recently, they might not even know about this incident, let alone leak it.

Combined with the series of strange articles in the *Lingao Times* recently, [Xiao Zishan][y001] was now certain that Panpan had been completely won over, which was why she had leaked these inside details she possessed.

"I have also done some data analysis work for the Great Library in the past. So she had a sufficient reason to come to me. But her excuse for coming was this magazine—speaking of which, I'm quite familiar with the fashion industry. It's also very much to my interest."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] said nothing.

"Your woman, she told me about her 'unintentionally.' She even praised her quite a bit, saying she was gentle and considerate, and a rare knowledgeable and intellectual woman, smart and witty. Finally, she also told me that although Elder Li is petite, she has a very good figure..."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] took a deep breath. A strong anger was brewing in his chest. He tried hard to control his emotions to avoid making a wrong judgment after being provoked.

"How do I know you're telling the truth?"

"From your expression, I know you already believe it," Xin Wuzui said. "It's not easy to control your emotions."

"Answer my question."

"First, you will see from next Monday's monitoring report that she came to see me. Second, do you think she came to see me just to talk about work?"

"She shouldn't know that you are..."

"No. She knows, and in great detail. She knows everything—including who the other three are, your woman, and your proposal to abolish the school—by the way, I think it's a good idea, just too risky, not very much like your style."

"Unbelievable," [Xiao Zishan][y001] was now completely convinced.

"You say that with no confidence at all," Xin Wuzui shrugged. "She used my past to threaten me."

"Threaten you?"

"Yes. And tempted me at the same time."

"That's contradictory..."

"She made me a promise. As long as I agree to help her, she will also help me get out of my current predicament. Otherwise, she will use the power of the female Elders to make sure I never rise again."

"That's ridiculous. How is that possible?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] found it hard to believe.

"Alright. She told me she has control of the *Lingao Times* and has great influence in the propaganda department. So she has a way to launch a campaign to clear my name—or at least to lift my current status."

"Tell me, how can an ordinary Elder do that?"

"You've also picked up the habit of an official, thinking you're always right," Xin Wuzui said, taking a piece of paper from the drawer. "This is the defense I wrote down from memory that she prepared to launch for my exoneration—as long as I agree to help her, she will start the action on the internal BBS. Then she will publish a theoretical article in *Morning Star*. She's even thought of the title: 'Reverse Nationalism is the Great Enemy of Our Cause'—what do you think of this title?"

[Xiao Zishan][y001] took it. The title was "Seeking Justice for the Four Persecuted Elders."

"'...Every life in nature has its rightful place. A woman's place is at a man's feet.' Isn't that the meaning of the traditional Chinese cultural concept of 'Heaven is superior, earth is inferior, and the husband is the guide for the wife'?

"Historically, modern feminism is a 20th-century invention. Its correctness has not been tested by time. In contrast, the system of one husband, one wife, and multiple concubines in East Asia, the polygamy in West Asia, and the system of one husband, one wife, and multiple mistresses in Europe have all been tested for at least a thousand years.

"What's the big deal about raping Salina, who wasn't even an Elder at the time? Are we going to convict an Elder for sleeping with a native? And a white-skinned native at that. Have you forgotten the history of white monkeys bullying the Chinese since the Opium War? Is it okay for others to bully the Chinese, but not for the Chinese to fight back?

"A bunch of traitors who kowtow to foreigners!!!

"Next, we need to continue to discuss the suspicious points of the Salina case itself.

"There are many Elders who are more beautiful than Salina, from lolis to mature women. Why didn't they assault them? They didn't even make any flirtatious remarks. Why did they specifically attack Salina at night? Isn't that very suspicious?

"In some aspects, China's legal system is relatively strict, so many people have not only not used certain items, but have never even heard of them. But don't forget, Salina comes from the United States, a country where the sex industry's annual output is hundreds of billions of dollars. And Salina, this Western woman, is a special agent. Isn't it easy for her to get some aphrodisiacs or love potions?

"The Western woman wanted to satisfy her own physiological needs and seduced several Elders, but the blame was put on the Elders. Is there any justice? Is there any law?

"Even if we take a step back and say the four Elders made a mistake, it should have been mainly criticism and education. But they were subjected to 'monitored use.' The Political Security Bureau has to submit a monitoring report every month.

"What the hell kind of method is this! This is the fascist method of Germany, Italy, and Japan! This is the Green Gang method of [Chiang Kai-shek][y010]!!!

"Back then, Premier Zhou explicitly stipulated that the Special Branch was 'not allowed to conduct intra-party reconnaissance' precisely because certain despicable methods cannot be used on comrades.

"But now, for a white-skinned foreign woman who was not an Elder at the time, for an American agent whose loyalty is extremely questionable, they actually used fascist methods! Green Gang hooligan methods! On four Elder comrades who risked their lives to participate in the great cause of transmigration!

"The Political Security Bureau should change its name! Change it to the Kowtow to Foreigners Bureau or the Grovel Before Foreign Women Bureau, or the Lick Both Foreigners and Foreign Women Bureau!

"What we need to discuss now is why certain elements in the Elder Council would rather believe an American agent, a non-Elder, a foreign woman who may be carrying out an ulterior mission for the CIA or the FBI. Based on her testimony alone, they convicted four Elders of attempted rape. And they refuse to believe four comrades who participated in the transmigration cause from the very beginning, Elders who have made contributions to the organization? This can only be explained by reverse racism..."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] could hardly believe this was her work. He was very familiar with this style of writing; it was the typical tone of a forum diatribe.

"Unbelievable." As a woman, wasn't it too strange for her to launch this campaign?

"Who said she's launching it?" Xin Wuzui shook his finger. "The person who launches the campaign will be your namesake."

"Xiao Bailang?!"

"Bingo!" Xin Wuzui smiled reservedly.

[Xiao Zishan][y001]'s hands turned cold. Indeed, if there was anyone most suitable to launch this campaign, it was Xiao Bailang, the leader of the Han chauvinist faction.

"Would Xiao Bailang listen to her?"

"Why not? For the Han chauvinists, the Salina case is absolutely 'politically incorrect.' Now that he knows the details, how could he not jump out and shout for us? Besides, this article is not wrong in many places. Also, she is very cute, very articulate, very smart, bold enough, and full of imagination. She could very well persuade Xiao Bailang and his comrades. To be honest, I really appreciate such a woman—I'm not interested in stupid women," Xin Wuzui said with a toothy grin.

"What does she want you to help with?"

"Do you even need to ask, Director [Xiao][y001]?"

[Xiao Zishan][y001] couldn't help but clench his fists. He quickly relaxed them again. "Why didn't you make a deal with her? You should hate the Executive Committee more."

"You are very suspicious—which is good. Social experience tells us that everything must stand up to the scrutiny of interests. The reason I chose you is simple: because you—" Xin Wuzui flicked his cigar, letting the long ash fall into a blue and white porcelain brush washer "—hold the power. Don't touch the women of the powerful—that's a personal lesson I've learned." Xin Wuzui said with a cynical smile, "If there were a second wormhole, I might consider giving it a try."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] knew that all the cards were on the table. In a sense, this grand gentleman Xin Wuzui had won. He had successfully used his feelings for [Li Xiaolü][y156] to provoke him and force him to change his decision.

"Why did you come to this time and space?" Xin Wuzui said leisurely. "To continue your past life of compromise and swallowing your pride?"

"I think your understanding is first-rate," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said. "Alright, I promise to give you a certain degree of freedom of activity within my authority, and a job you find pleasant where you can interact with more Elders—limited to males only. Other restrictions remain unchanged."

"A bit harsh. But acceptable."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] said finally, "I don't care what the other Elder you saw said. You are not to make a move on any female Elder—remember, any of them. If you violate this, you will definitely need to find another wormhole."

"No problem," Xin Wuzui raised his hands, a pure smile on his face. "You will be satisfied."
