Author: Chui Niu Zhe (The Braggart)

This is a "group transmigration" and "empire building" story.

Since I started working, I've mostly written all sorts of reports. This is my first time writing a web novel, so I'm a bit lacking in confidence. I'm not even sure if I'll be able to finish it without abandoning it. I'll do my best to see it through to the end.

I won't say much about the origin of this book. Those who know will know at a glance that this is a by-product of a role-playing campaign on a certain forum. I was very interested in the event back then, but my participation was low; I was a silent observer.

My biggest feeling from the event was that when everyone's ideals are aligned, the enthusiasm and power that erupt are astonishing. When differences in ideas emerge and conflicts are not resolved in time, the event slowly begins to fall silent.

No wonder some have said that group transmigration is a major taboo in the transmigration genre, a category destined for failure.

However, I still want to give it a try.

PS: I've spent about half a year preparing for this book, including collecting various historical and technical materials. Fortunately, I have some favorable conditions at hand, including libraries and academic networks, which have greatly enriched my resources.

I've tried to make the historical details as reliable as possible. However, because the sources are wide-ranging, there are many contradictions. Sometimes, for the sake of the plot or when specific information is unavailable, the historical materials I choose may have discrepancies. My own historical knowledge is also rather shallow, so problems are inevitable. I welcome your corrections.

This novel is primarily in the "empire building" (种田流) genre. Besides academic papers and professional books, the main source of technical information comes from various pamphlets on simple, indigenous methods from the Great Leap Forward period. Due to limited material conditions at the time, simple manufacturing and local methods were all the rage. There will definitely be "golden fingers" (金手指, cheats or special abilities) in terms of technology, hehe. I'll try to make them somewhat self-justifying.

I'll try to make the plot as reasonable as possible. Of course, sometimes the "protagonist's halo" (主角光环, plot armor) will have to be activated, otherwise, there's no way to get by.

Friends who are willing to provide opinions and suggestions on the plot, characters, or technology, please leave a message in the review section. Thank you for your support.
