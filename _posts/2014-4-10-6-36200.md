None of the people who came to Lingao knew the specifics of the mission. It was clear that Shi Weng had no confidence in their ability to infiltrate Lingao safely. That was why he resolutely refused to reveal the details of the mission beforehand.

According to the plan, they were to meet in three days to discuss the next steps.

However, Sima Qiudao had not yet received any further instructions. Zhuo Yifan and his group had come as immigrants, so there was no need for him to transfer operational funds to them, as they could exchange large amounts of circulation coupons without suspicion.

Sima Qiudao left the train station and walked slowly to the Fourth Post Office in East Gate Market.

He went to the "P.O. Box rental" department. The Native Products Company had a dedicated business mailbox there, and all correspondence from their business partners was sent and received through this mailbox.

At Seventh Master's suggestion, after joining the company, Sima Qiudao had volunteered to collect the mail from the post office every day. This gave him a very reliable and convenient contact address.

After greeting the people at the post office, Sima Qiudao opened the Native Products Company's business mailbox. It was already full of various letters. Sima Qiudao placed the letters on the sorting table, looked them over one by one, and then put them in his satchel.

Suddenly, an ordinary letter caught his eye. On the surface, it was no different from other similar business letters, but the return address and company name were fake, which was the secret sign for a contact letter.

Back at the shop, he gave the letters he had collected to the manager. After work, he went out alone, found a small tavern, and ordered a private room. He ordered a pot of fruit wine, a plate of sprouted beans, a plate of salted whelks, a few skewers of grilled squid, and a large bowl of Lingao noodles, and began to drink by himself, looking like a single man enjoying his simple pleasures.

There were not many customers in the tavern today. The food and wine were served quickly. Sima Qiudao, sprinkled with cumin, listened carefully to the outside and confirmed that there was nothing suspicious. Only then did he take out the letter and tear it open.

Inside were a few thin sheets of paper. The content was innocuous, all about business dealings with the native products company. Of course, this letter could never fall into the hands of the people at the Native Products Company, because they had no such client. Sima Qiudao held the letter over the flame of the gas lamp, and writing gradually appeared in the blank spaces.

After reading only a few lines, Sima Qiudao sucked in a cold breath. *Damn it! This is too difficult.*

The letter contained the mission for this trip: to kidnap one or two true 髡 and find a way to secretly transport them to the mainland.

Sima Qiudao had been in Lingao for a few days and had some knowledge of the local situation. Kidnap a true 髡? It was easier said than done. In this stronghold of the true 髡, finding one was as difficult as reaching the sky!

It wasn't that the Senators were reclusive. Sima Qiudao often saw reports of "Chief So-and-so attending such-and-such event." He also occasionally heard talk in the Native Products Company about which Senator had visited which enterprise under the Ministry of Commerce that day. The problem was that there were too many naturalized citizens in Lingao. The Senators blended in among them, unlike the red-haired foreigners who stood out with their different ethnicity. Moreover, the Senators' social and work circles were basically composed of naturalized citizens. The only people who could get close to the Senators, besides the naturalized citizens, were a small group of upper-class natives from the early days.

A native like Sima Qiudao, who had just entered a "state-owned enterprise" and hadn't even shaved his head, was a peripheral employee in the company. It could be said that he had basically no opportunity to come into contact with the Senators, let alone carry out a kidnapping operation—he rarely even had the chance to see a "chief."

And that wasn't all. Even if they could kidnap a "true 髡," it was even more unimaginable to take them away. Lingao was the 髡's "capital," and it was crawling with overt and covert agents. The police, the garrison, and the National Army were everywhere. Their side had no connections and no inside help. It was difficult enough to get close to a Senator, let alone kidnap one and take them away.

"Which bastard came up with this idea?!" Sima Qiudao cursed inwardly as he lit the paper with the gas lamp.

For now, he could only take it one step at a time. Sima Qiudao secretly calculated that kidnapping a true 髡 was extremely difficult. It might be easier to capture a fake 髡 cadre. But this fake 髡 had to be a high-ranking official. If it was just one of the "cadres" with four pockets that were all over the streets, what was the use of capturing a mere clerk? At this thought, he was troubled again. Although he had heard from Seventh Master that the fake 髡 "cadres" also had different ranks and levels, on the outside, they all just wore four-pocketed jackets. There were no official robes or mandarin squares. On the street, it was impossible to tell which official was high-ranking and which was low-ranking. They needed someone to point them out.

What they lacked now was this "insider." Although Seventh Master could provide a lot of important information, he had always refused to show his face.

*How about we just try to assassinate one or two true 髡?* Sima Qiudao thought. Anyway, there would be a fierce battle, and not many of them would make it back alive. It would be easy to get their stories straight. They could just say that the true 髡 had been captured, but were intercepted on the way and had to be killed to prevent them from being rescued.

As long as they had a few personal effects of the true 髡, there was no doubt that Shi Weng would believe them. And even if he didn't, what could he do? Anyway, Sima Qiudao had already received a promise from a high-ranking official in the court that, regardless of the outcome, as long as he could return safely, he would be recommended to serve under Hong Chengchou.

In that case, he had to focus on the "assassination." Sima Qiudao thought to himself that Huang Zhen would not be a problem. He was the first disciple of the Huashan Sect and had been through a lot. He would naturally understand the stakes and would get the point with a single hint. But this Zhuo Yifan—although he hadn't had much contact with him, he came from a family of officials and was a disciple of the White Stone Daoist. He was a young man who had achieved success early in life. If he insisted on "serving the country with utmost loyalty," it might not be easy to fool him.

Sima Qiudao thought it over and decided to contact Zhuo Yifan first. After all, his group was the main force of this operation. Once they made contact, they should act as soon as possible—every day they stayed in this 髡's territory was a day too long.

Zhuo Yifan received Sima Qiudao's secret letter and, as instructed, went to Nanbao to meet with Huang Zhen and the others.

Nanbao was far less prosperous than East Gate Market and had little industry and commerce. After getting off the carriage, the streets seemed a bit deserted. But it was a refreshing change for Zhuo Yifan, who had been forced to follow the "house-viewing group" everywhere these days and maintain the pretense of being the "head of the family."

This place was close to the Li area, with typical hilly terrain. Although the coal mining had destroyed some of the original landscape, the mining area was limited, and the scenery in most places was still worth seeing. The greening work in the town was also well done.

The weather was gloomy, and it looked like it was about to rain. Worried about the rain, Zhuo Yifan quickened his pace.

As he turned a corner, he suddenly heard a commotion ahead. Zhuo Yifan looked closely and saw a man who looked like a rich young master, with a few fierce servants, harassing and teasing a "fake 髡" woman.

The young master held a fine Xiangfei bamboo fan in his hand, wore a lake-blue silk robe, a square scarf on his head, white cloth socks, and bright red cloth shoes from Chenqiao. He looked like a scholar, but there was a猥琐 (wěisuǒ - lewd) expression in his eyes. Seeing his "prey" surrounded, he was even more triumphant. He covered half of his face with his fan, revealing a smile that he thought was dashing but was actually lecherous and vulgar.

He recognized this person: it was the young master of the Bai family, who lived in the same inn as him—known as Bai Siwen (Bai the Refined).

Looking at the fake 髡 woman, she didn't look like a woman from a respectable family either. She wore a light-colored, front-opening top with sleeves that only reached her elbows. It was form-fitting, accentuating the curves of her chest—which was quite magnificent. And that was not all. The blue skirt she wore was so short it was outrageous. Not only were her calves exposed, but even her knees were clearly visible. As she panicked and retreated, her skirt flew up, revealing a glimpse of her thighs.

Zhuo Yifan was originally disgusted by the young master's harassment of the woman, but seeing the fake 髡 girl so "indecent," his sense of justice diminished somewhat—she had brought it on herself!

However, when a woman was being harassed and molested, one should always lend a helping hand. But he was in a precarious situation, and he was unfamiliar with this place. If he intervened, it could lead to all sorts of trouble and expose his identity...

While he was hesitating, a whistle blew on the street. The crowd of onlookers immediately dispersed. Zhuo Yifan was startled, not knowing what had happened. He saw a policewoman running over, blowing her whistle and shouting, "What are you doing? Stop!"

Seeing that the one who had come forward was just a woman, Zhuo Yifan was secretly worried. He didn't know what kind of medicine these 髡 had taken, but they often used women as public servants. It was one thing if they were burly and fierce like she-devils, but many were just ordinary young girls like this one. Although she was far away, she looked quite pretty.

Women are naturally weaker than men in terms of strength, so women who practice martial arts mostly focus on lightness and agility, and never confront strength with strength. The three fierce servants with Bai Siwen, although they didn't look like they had practiced martial arts, were all strong and had the advantage of numbers. It was not certain that she would be their opponent if she rushed in rashly.

Of course, it was also possible that Bai Siwen's servants would be sensible enough to stop now.

However, things did not develop as Zhuo Yifan had thought. Bai Siwen waved his fan, and the three servants actually pounced on the policewoman at the same time, while he himself turned and ran.

Zhuo Yifan stomped his feet in frustration, cursing Bai Siwen for his absurdity! It was fine to run away, but why send his servants to block her? The delicate policewoman would surely be hurt. He was not feeling pity for her because of her beauty. The 髡 prided themselves on their legal system, unlike the Ming officials, where a major incident could be covered up by throwing a servant under the bus as a scapegoat. If the Bai family had no strong connections here, the 髡 would definitely investigate and punish them severely. Since he lived in the same inn as the Bai family, he would inevitably be implicated.

What happened next was beyond his expectations. The policewoman had a baton in her hand as she ran over. In a few moves, she had knocked down all the servants one by one. Zhuo Yifan couldn't see her martial arts style. Her moves were simple and practical, and her attacks were ruthless, aimed at vital points, without any frills. It was somewhat like the martial arts of the army.
