To the east, about six nautical miles away, a fleet of about ten ships of varying sizes appeared.

Le Lin, the first mate of the *Great Whale*, raised his binoculars and watched the course of the distant ships with intense focus.

The wind gently filled the two hard sails of the *Great Whale*, pushing the ship along at a speed of 2 knots. The first mate checked his watch. It had been two hours since the ship left Haian Port.

The *Great Whale* had entered Haian the previous night and unloaded its cargo of two hundred shi of rice. Afterwards, it loaded two hundred shi of sugar. The original plan did not include loading sugar, as its mission was to act as bait, and in a battle, it would be impossible to protect the cargo's safety. Whether it was damaged by water, fire, or blood, the sugar would be unsellable. Moreover, sugar is an excellent combustible, and a fire in battle would be no laughing matter.

But if they didn't load any sugar, they couldn't act as bait. The enemy had informants in Haian Street.

Xi Yazhou raised his binoculars and watched the ships' course intently. His reputation among the masses had plummeted due to his excessive deletion of posts on the Lingao BBS, and he had been exposed for playing wargames on his computer under the guise of "map-based exercises" during work hours. Now, he was eager for an opportunity to prove himself. This was a naval operation, many of the navy's key personnel were away on long voyages, and the *Great Whale* was tasked with being bait, which basically meant preparing for cannon fire and close-quarters combat. Having an army officer in command was not a problem. Of course, the ship's navigation was still handled by the navy.

"First Mate," he turned to the first mate, "are those the pirates hired by the Haiyi Guild?"

"It's very likely," Le Lin replied, "but it's still unclear. We'll know for sure when they get closer."

"Good," Xi Yazhou said. "Order a high alert. Tell everyone to make the necessary preparations."

The order was immediately relayed throughout the ship. All combat preparations were executed. The number of lookouts was increased to four.

"Signal Detachment A that suspicious ships have appeared 6 nautical miles from our position," Xi Yazhou said, standing on the sterncastle. He felt a bit like a general in a movie, though the deck covered in straw bags was a rather uninspiring sight.

Detachment A, consisting of two fishing trawlers, was responsible for providing direct cover for the *Great Whale* to prevent it from being overwhelmed. They were on standby 10 nautical miles to the south, maintaining their distance. According to the plan, once a battle began, Detachment A would come to their aid. Their mission was to cooperate with the *Great Whale* to eliminate the enemy on the spot if there were fewer than four enemy ships. If there were more than four, they would use their maneuverability and firepower to protect the *Great Whale*, repel the enemy, and force them to flee towards Juhua Yu, where an ambush was set.

The fleet was approaching at a considerable speed. The wind on the sea was not strong, but the enemy's speed was noticeably fast.

"They're using oars," Le Lin said. "They're desperately chasing us."

"They must have been tipped off as soon as we entered the port yesterday, otherwise how could they be so precise," Xi Yazhou said, watching the approaching fleet. The thought of the impending fierce battle excited him. Although he had been a soldier, this was his first time in a real-life engagement.

The fleet closed in another two nautical miles. Le Lin estimated their speed at at least 4 knots. In addition to sails, each ship was being propelled by at least six to eight oars. Now, there could be no misunderstanding the fleet's intentions.

"It's the pirates!" Le Lin lowered his binoculars.

"Indeed," Xi Yazhou replied. "Battle stations!"

The ship's bell on the *Great Whale* was rung rapidly. Sailors emerged from their quarters and ran to their battle stations, interspersed with army artillerymen in gray uniforms with red artillery collar patches. They had come aboard with the four 12-pounder cannons.

The sailors quickly moved the outer layer of sugar bags into the hold. The other straw bags, filled with sand, were left in place. They served as a temporary parapet for the gun positions, disguised as cargo. The four cannons and their ammunition boxes were hidden deep within these parapets, covered with straw mats. The sailors pumped two water pumps, drenching the straw bags and the deck with seawater to guard against incendiary weapons.

It was indeed Gu Dachun's fleet. The ten ships of varying sizes had set out the previous night from an island near Xuwen. Although there were only ten ships, seven of them were independent operators who had temporarily joined him. Gu Dachun had recently gathered these ships. The five thousand taels from Third Master Zhu, plus the sugar he had previously seized, had greatly emboldened him. What excited him even more was that his cheap brother-in-law, who had always looked down on him, had changed his attitude completely since he successfully intercepted the *Guangbing* and seized two hundred shi of sugar. He was now heavily reliant on him, which made Gu Dachun feel vindicated. Naturally, his attitude became more proactive.

Looking at the strange, clumsy ship of Huanan ahead, Gu Dachun felt that victory was within his grasp. He even felt he had gone overboard by bringing in these extra ships—his own three ships would have been enough to surround and solve the problem. This time, Third Master Zhu had sent a clear message through Qiu Han: seizing the sugar was a minor matter; the key was to ensure that, apart from the Haiyi Guild's ships, no one else dared to transport a single shipload of sugar out of Leizhou.

Gu Dachun naturally understood the unspoken meaning. The previous message was just to "teach them a lesson." The meaning now was very different. The best way to make people afraid was to kill and burn. So this time, he was determined not to show any mercy.

Third Master Zhu wanted him to add ships and cannons and expand his fleet, which was not difficult. A trip to Jiangping would allow him to recruit a large number of rough fishermen who were part-time pirates. They lived in this lawless region, neither Vietnamese nor Ming subjects, all dirt-poor, and would jump at any opportunity for piracy at sea. Some could even bring their own boats, providing their own "tools of production." Gu Dachun quickly recruited seven large ships and nearly six hundred men.

However, cannons and gunpowder were not easy to come by. Gu Dachun had not used such things before. He had to pull many strings to find a workshop in the countryside of Qinzhou that privately cast cannons and muskets. He bought more than ten cannons at forty taels each. But gunpowder was hard to get. Third Master Zhu helped him get a few barrels from the Leizhou naval forces, and he managed to buy some more himself. With that, he had armed his three ships. However, they had no qualified gunners. The pirates were not skilled with these things and were very wary of the contraptions that recoiled violently when fired and sometimes exploded. Therefore, the battle would still primarily be fought through boarding and close-quarters combat. The pirates were now gathered on deck, holding various weapons, ready to jump aboard and fight as soon as they got close.

Whether the pirates attacked the *Great Whale* head-on or surrounded it, it was bound to be a battle with a great disparity in numbers. Le Lin lowered his binoculars, feeling a chill run down his neck.

Among the ten enemy ships, three were large, two-masted vessels with three to five cannons each. The other seven ships, some single-masted and some two-masted, were smaller, similar to the common coastal fishing boats, with no signs of cannons. But on their decks, swarms of dark-skinned men stood, and although their expressions were unclear through the binoculars, the glint of their weapons in the sunlight was enough to strike fear into one's heart.

The enemy had eleven to fifteen cannons. The *Great Whale* had only four. The hundred or so sailors on board would have to fight against seven or eight hundred men. It would certainly be a lopsided battle. Of course, the *Great Whale* had a certain advantage in firepower, enough to deliver a heavy blow to a reckless enemy—as long as they didn't get too close and maintained a certain distance. The *Great Whale* could use its accurate cannon fire to gradually eliminate them.

In short, the transmigrators had to do everything in their power to avoid being boarded. In a naval battle, once close-quarters combat begins, numbers become even more important than on land—there is no retreat on a ship; to flee is to die.

Another half hour passed. The fleet had clearly closed the distance, drawing nearer to the *Great Whale*, which continued on its course at the same speed, seemingly oblivious to its fate.

Xi Yazhou constantly observed the pirates' movements. It seemed the enemy did not realize it was a trap. The battle preparations on the ship were quickly completed. Sailors and gunners were all at their posts. The gunners concentrated on measuring the distance to the ships and adjusting the cannons' angles. The naval soldiers, hidden behind the straw bag parapet, followed their officers' commands, hastily biting open their ammunition packets and loading their Minie rifles. Since this was a naval battle and bayonets were impractical, all sailors and soldiers were issued a cutlass.

"Signal Detachment A: Ten enemy ships are continuously approaching our vessel, distance 1.5 nautical miles." The second message was sent.

Around 8 a.m., the pirate fleet had moved to a position one nautical mile upwind of the *Great Whale*. Although the pirates were illiterate and had never studied naval tactics, they understood the strategy of gaining the windward advantage. They used large oars to row their ships closer. The *Great Whale* maintained its southward course. Gu Dachun's fleet formed up and charged: the three large, two-masted ships in the center, with the other seven split to the sides, three on the right and four on the left, attempting to outflank the *Great Whale* and surround it. Their plan was to first use cannon fire to inflict casualties on the deck, then close in to board and capture the ship.

"We must not let them get close to our ship," Xi Yazhou said to Le Lin. "First, concentrate all fire to repel one of the wings." He looked through his binoculars. "All hands, fire to the starboard side."
