Jiang Muzhi and Li Chiqi improved the new gun carriage, solved the locking device problem, and switched to better quality ball bearings. It finally passed the firing range and 50-kilometer march tests. The success of this major improvement led the General Staff to decide that all newly manufactured cannons during the First Five-Year Plan would use metal carriages, and the existing old-style wooden carriages would be gradually modified. The mechanical department urgently manufactured new carriages for the three field artillery companies. Then, even the limber of the gun carriage was improved.

Although they were using "animal-substitute soldiers" instead of enough horses, the limber was still indispensable—not only for loading ammunition, but more importantly, because the gun's center of gravity was high, it was very difficult to maintain balance when pulling it, and a slight carelessness could lead to a fall. The limber could support the tail of the gun carriage during traction, balance the center of gravity, and also distribute the pressure of the heavy gun body, so that the horses or people pulling the gun carriage only needed to provide forward pulling force.

"After the improvement, the artillery moves much more flexibly," Ying Yu inspected the new artillery arranged on the firing range. The artillerymen were constantly running back and forth under the command of the officers, simulating the firing procedure of the artillery. According to the requirements of the artillery training syllabus, the 8 gunners of each gun had to undergo cross-training so that they could continue to fire in the event of casualties. According to the syllabus: a well-trained gun crew should be able to continue firing even if only two men are left. According to Lin Shenhe, there were examples during the Civil War where only one gunner could keep the cannon in action—of course, that was enough to earn a medal.

"If only we had horses," Lin Shenhe said with regret, watching the artillerymen running back and forth, training according to the artillery syllabus he had written. 110 horses for one company! It was like a dream.

"You said you were going to make new shells. Is there any result yet? The gunners still need to familiarize themselves with the loading and firing of the new shells," Zhang Bolin came running in a hurry, wearing a sweaty undershirt.

"Soon. The new shells will only be better to use than the old ones," Lin Shenhe said with a yawn—he would have to hang the red lantern in the laboratory again in the afternoon.

Originally, for the sake of simplifying the process, the army's artillery was only mass-produced with the two simplest types of shells—solid shot and canister shot. A small amount of high-explosive shells were also produced, but only for training purposes and not for stockpiling.

The principle of high-explosive shells fired by smoothbore cannons was largely the same: the gas from the cannon's firing would ignite the time fuse on the shell to detonate it. Therefore, special care must be taken when loading to ensure that the fuse hole is facing the muzzle, otherwise if the gas directly rushes into the fuse hole, the shell will explode in the barrel. To withstand the higher chamber pressure, the shell casing must be made very thick. A 12-pound spherical shell can only be filled with 900 grams of black powder. The fragmentation effect of its explosion on personnel is even worse than that of solid shot. The artillery was equipped with high-explosive shells mainly to deal with buildings and ships, and also to scare people—after all, explosive shells were not very common in this era.

What he was preparing to develop was shrapnel. The structure of shrapnel was more complex than other spherical shells: a number of iron or lead balls and a bursting charge were packed into the shell body, and a time fuse controlled its detonation at a suitable height and distance. After the bursting charge blew open the shell body, the balls inside would maintain their previous speed and fly towards the enemy in front, with a power equivalent to a close-range shot of canister.

The killing effect of shrapnel at medium and long ranges was excellent compared to solid shot and high-explosive shells, especially when attacking dense formations of enemy troops. If the timing of the fuse detonation was well-controlled, it could instantly knock down a large number of enemies. However, early shrapnel was neither accurate nor safe to fire—the balls inside the shrapnel could easily rub against each other during firing and prematurely detonate the powder in the shell.

Lin Shenhe chose the shrapnel improved by British Army Captain Boxer in 1840. It had a greatly improved structure, but was of course more complex. The balls were placed in the front of the shell body, separated from the bursting charge in the rear by an iron partition. The tail was fitted with a cup-shaped tail pad that not only prevented the balls from tumbling in the barrel, but also expanded under the pressure of the firing gas to act as a gas seal. This structure made the entire shell light in the rear and heavy in the front. Combined with the unique shape of the tail pad, the shell was quite stable in flight, and its accuracy was much higher than that of contemporary shrapnel. When the time fuse detonated the bursting charge, the shell body was blown open and the iron partition would push the balls forward, causing them to shoot forward in a cone, rather than scattering randomly like other shrapnel, which further increased its killing power.

When firing shrapnel with a 12-pounder cannon, it could be effective at a distance of 1100 meters, and its power was far superior to that of a high-explosive shell that could only produce twenty large fragments.

With this thing, the Fubo Army could effectively kill fast-moving cavalry formations at medium and long ranges, without having to wait until they were 200 meters away to fire canister shot.

Originally, it was not necessary to mass-produce shrapnel to deal with the Guangdong Ming army, which was mainly composed of infantry. However, since it was only a matter of time before they contended for the mainland, it was better to take the opportunity of the Ming army's suppression campaign to test it in advance.

Finally, he wanted to modify the time fuse used by the artillery. With shrapnel, it became very important to use a safe and reliable fuse.

In the past, Zhang Bolin's smoothbore artillery used the simplest time fuse when training to fire high-explosive shells. It was so simple that everyone thought it was too easy. A hollow wooden tube with open ends—the Transmigrators even saved the trouble of processing the hollow wooden tube and used thin bamboo tubes directly—the tube was filled with slow-burning powder with a very stable burning rate. The fuse was marked with a scale. When using it, the gunner would first estimate the firing distance, look up the flight time corresponding to the distance and shell type in the artillery manual, then cut off the corresponding length according to the scale on the fuse, insert it into the fuse hole of the shell, with one end exposed outside the shell body and the other end in contact with the explosive inside the shell body. Finally, the shell was inserted into the barrel, ensuring that the fuse was facing forward—later, a wooden sabot was directly installed on the spherical shells that used a time fuse to ensure the accuracy of the loading direction.

This fuse was intuitive and convenient to operate, but because the fuse was inserted manually, the depth of insertion would affect the detonation result. Moreover, the fuse hole and the fuse could not be completely sealed, and it was sometimes unsafe to use. Lin Shenhe decided to directly imitate the Bormann fuse. This was the best and most reliable time fuse that could be found on a smoothbore cannon. It was a flat metal cylinder with threads on the outside, which could be screwed into the fuse hole. The surface was engraved with time, and when using it, you just had to punch a hole at the desired time scale and then screw it into the fuse hole of the shell. The maximum time of the Bormann fuse was only 5.5 seconds, which was not suitable for shells with a very slow initial velocity, such as those from a mortar.

After drawing the three-view drawing of the fuse, he gave the drawing to the mechanical department.

"This thing requires a certain degree of precision to manufacture. I have to find an Elder to do it," [Zhan Wuya][y004] said after looking at it. "Brass?"

"Yes."

"The size is still small, so brass won't consume much," [Zhan Wuya][y004] looked at the dimensions. "How about making a thousand first?"

"No problem. I don't think Zhang Bolin's gunners will have a chance to fire a thousand high-explosive and shrapnel shells."

"There's one more thing. Since we are now mass-producing high-explosive and shrapnel shells, we can make fixed ammunition for these two types of shells," Lin Shenhe said. "After all, the rate of fire of fixed ammunition is much faster."

The so-called fixed ammunition was to fix a cloth powder bag under the wooden sabot of the high-explosive and shrapnel shells. In this way, the original steps of loading the powder and loading the shell were combined into one.

The sound of cannons rumbled on the firing range. While the army was stepping up its war preparations, the navy was also busy with the trial production of new equipment. The navy's combat mission was to blockade, and at the same time, it was also responsible for protecting the coastline of Lingao, especially the key ports of Bopu and Maniao.

The navy had to dispatch most of its ships to carry out the maritime blockade mission, and at the same time continue to undertake the task of transporting supplies to Sanya. The ships that could directly protect the port would be greatly reduced. The defense system of Bopu was mainly based on heavy artillery, with strong long-range firepower, but the force directly protecting the port was a bit weak. Maniao only had one blockhouse and one marine platoon, and its defense force was even weaker.

"Our defense force in Maniao is too thin," Chen Haiyang said at the operational meeting. "Maniao is our salt chemical raw material supply base, and there is also a modern salt factory. The defense force is only one platoon and one blockhouse—and the one on top is equipped with a 12-pounder mountain howitzer. If the enemy breaks through the maritime blockade and lands in Maniao—there are steam salt factories, windmills, and boilers there. Just one fire would be a heavy loss."

Maniao had a shallow water port, which was very suitable for the small tonnage ships used by the Ming army for infiltration landing operations.

"Isn't it a bit late to talk about building forts now?"

"No, a month is enough," said Mei Wan, who came to attend the meeting. "Give me enough resources. In a month, I can build a large bastion that can accommodate an infantry company in wartime and is equipped with heavy artillery."

"Is that possible?" The attendees whispered to each other for a while. He Ming nodded: "I'll try to get it. But you have to ensure that it's completed in a month."

"I guarantee it will be completed," Mei Wan said.

"Instead of building a bastion, it's better to make some sea mines to blockade the port and defend against enemy ship infiltration," Li Di, as the port director and fortress commander, was obsessed with the matter of sea mines.

"Sea mines? I'm afraid they'll blow up our own ships," Chen Haiyang was well aware of the effectiveness of sea mines, so he was more hesitant to use them.

The technology of triggered moored mines was very simple, but the navy had no minesweepers. Once minesweeping was needed, it would be very inconvenient. If a mine broke its mooring and drifted, given the width of the Qiongzhou Strait, it would be a weapon of indiscriminate ship-bombing.

In the past, the navy and the weapons design department had considered the manufacture of visually-guided electric mines to be laid in the port channel for defense. But the problems of anti-corrosion and leakage of the electric wires in seawater and the problem of mines breaking their moorings could not be solved well, so the electric mine plan was abandoned.

Another solution was the spar torpedo boat proposed by [Wen Desi][y002]. The initial design of the spar torpedo boat was a rowing boat with an armored covered deck, driven by human oars. The explosive charge was fixed to the side of the boat, and an electric wire was connected to the spar torpedo boat. The spar torpedo boat would then quickly back-paddle to a safe distance and then use an electric detonator to detonate the explosive charge.

Although this design fully considered the safety of the spar torpedo boat, when using a rowing boat for simulation tests, it was found that using oars was not convenient. It was difficult for the sailors to maintain a calm rowing rhythm under enemy fire, and the maneuverability of the human-powered spar torpedo boat was not as good as imagined. And the electric detonator brought back the old problem: the waterproof electric wire could not be solved. So the spar torpedo boat project had been shelved. Now, the inner harbor was guarded by a few transport boats equipped with typewriter machine guns. The firepower was fierce, but it was not powerful enough against large ships.

"We can now mass-produce steam-powered 'Sanfa' boats. We can completely modify the existing equipment," [Wen Desi][y002] was very enthusiastic about this matter and began to promote his spar torpedo boats again.

The so-called 'Sanfa' boats were standardized motorboats manufactured by the shipyard to unify the small transport boats used in coastal and inland rivers. They were divided into large, medium, and small 'Fa' boats according to their size.

[Wen Desi][y002]'s proposal was to use a wooden-hulled medium 'Fa' boat as the base boat. This boat had a full-load displacement of 15.5 tons, a length of 13 meters, a width of 2.9 meters, a molded depth of 1.5 meters, and an average draft of 0.78 meters. It was equipped with a Suichao-type small steam engine. The speed at full load was 4.5 knots. Although the speed was a bit slow, it was more than enough for maneuvering in ports and coastal harbors.

With mobility, the electric ignition that was previously used for safety was no longer necessary.

This new type of spar torpedo boat used a steam-powered medium 'Fa' boat as the prototype. It was covered with a layer of iron plates laid at an angle as armor—the iron plates did not need to be thick, as long as they could withstand matchlock fire. At the bow was a metal long pole that could be retracted into the hull. The front end of the metal pole had a detachable buckle that connected to the spar torpedo body. The spar torpedo itself was a flat cylindrical wooden box containing 30 kg of black powder. Its front end was flat, with many barbed nails on it, in order to be able to fix it to the ship's planking. The tail was a release device, connected to the buckle at the front end of the torpedo pole. Once the fixation was complete, the personnel in the cabin immediately pulled the device to separate the torpedo and the boat. The release device on the torpedo pole was connected to the pull cord of the igniter. Once released, the pull cord was pulled by the force of the separation, and the pull tube ignited the fuse and began to burn until the delay ended and the spar torpedo was detonated.

The detonation device of the spar torpedo used the ignition device of a wooden handle grenade, which was simple and reliable. It was not difficult for the Transmigration Group's industry to manufacture.

After the torpedo and the boat were separated, the spar torpedo boat could retreat to a safe area, retract the torpedo pole into the boat, reload the torpedo, and attack again when the opportunity arose.

Because it used a steam engine, the mobility of the spar torpedo boat was guaranteed. Although its tonnage was small and its speed was slow, it was not very useful in the open sea, but it was very useful in the chaotic battles in narrow inner harbors.

Its mobility and armor could ensure that it would not be attacked or boarded in close-quarters combat, and the spar torpedo could be reloaded multiple times. The cost of this boat was not high, and it could be mass-produced quickly, making it ideal for protecting the harbor.

"Is the connection between the torpedo body and the ship guaranteed? It probably takes a lot of impact force to fix the torpedo body to the hull."

"It might not work with oars, but steam power is enough. We can add something sticky—like tree gum—to increase adhesion."

"With this fully enclosed armor, how do the boat operators observe?"

"Use armored louvers," [Wen Desi][y002] said. "See this round armored turret protruding from the hull? There are six armored observation windows arranged in a circle on the turret body."

The conning tower was for two people. A helmsman was in front steering, and the boat captain sat in a slightly higher position behind the helmsman. His seat could rotate, and he could observe the outside situation through the louvers. The helmsman steered according to his commands, and the boat captain could also command the entire boat through an internal communication tube.

"There are two engineers in charge of the steam engine, and two sailors in charge of operating the spar torpedo. Plus a substitute—he can help add coal. Seven people are enough for the whole boat. In addition to the pre-loaded one, there are four spare torpedoes," [Wen Desi][y002] pointed to his design drawing.

According to [Wen Desi][y002]'s vision, this spar torpedo boat would have no problem protecting the harbor until the Transmigrators could build flywheel torpedoes. It was at least more destructive than a machine gun boat. One spar torpedo was enough to destroy or severely damage a ship of several hundred tons.

"Four in Maniao, ten in Bopu. Half in a state of readiness to fire, and half resting. As long as they can destroy two or three enemy ships, the other side will be scared enough to flee."

It was immediately decided to submit an emergency shipbuilding proposal to the Planning Institute for the construction of sixteen spar torpedo boats and eight machine gun boats.

Wu De immediately approved this shipbuilding proposal. As for whether the spar torpedo boats were that useful, it was not a big problem in his opinion—if they were useless, they could be dismantled and used as transport boats. In any case, it would not be a waste.

[Zhan Wuya][y004] received clear instructions from He Ming to organize militia in all factories. They were to be trained for one hour every day.

"Military training with spears?"

"First, use spears for bayonet and formation techniques. You can use training guns for gun handling for now. And throwing—Hai Lin has already handed over a few hundred training grenades. You can take a hundred to train the workers," He Ming said. "I have already submitted an application to the Planning Institute to urgently expand rifle production. By then, everyone will have a rifle—you need to select the most politically reliable and determined elements from the worker militia as the core militia, ready to be called upon at any time."

"What? You want to drag the workers to fight?" [Zhan Wuya][y004] was shocked. The industrial workers who had been painstakingly trained were a great loss even if one of them died.

"They are to act as reserves and garrison troops. They will not be mobilized to attack and fight," He Ming explained. "In addition to the factories, the communes and local villages also need to be mobilized. But the workers' self-defense force will be the main force."
