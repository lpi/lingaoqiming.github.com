Liang Cunhou nodded. "I am surprised that Second Master Huang possesses such a loyal and patriotic heart. However, a mere warning requires only a messenger. Young Master Huang, with your great talent and familiarity with the ways of the髡, you are a rare asset to the court. I have more important matters for which I must borrow your skills."

Huang Bingkun quickly replied, "As long as it benefits the country and the people, I will follow Young Master Liang's command!"

"The situation in Guangzhou is already lost," Liang Cunhou said, his voice low. "The 髡 bandits' morale is high; they are unstoppable. The government troops have neither the will nor the ability to fight. Now, the only weapon we have left is the hearts of the people!"

"But the 髡 are masters of deception, bewitching the populace with their empty words. Even a sage reborn would be unable to make them see the truth..." Huang Bingkun felt a familiar sense of defeat. Whenever the conversation turned to winning the hearts of the people, the 髡 always seemed to emerge victorious.

"Hehe, that's where you are mistaken," Liang Cunhou said. "The 髡 have just landed and have yet to establish a firm foothold. This is a golden opportunity to raise a righteous army!" A spark of excitement lit his eyes. "This is not Qiongzhou. This land has long been civilized by the Emperor's grace. The gentry and scholars are numerous. As long as we explain the great righteousness of our cause and provide a leader, we need not worry that a righteous army will fail to rise like a swarm of bees!"

Liang Cunhou's plan was for Huang Bingkun to travel to the more remote counties of the Pearl River Delta and raise this army. He estimated that the Australians' forces were small. The officials in the various counties would either be terrified of the enemy or would rush to curry favor with the new power. In the short term, the region would inevitably be "pacified by proclamation." The 髡 forces were not numerous enough to disperse and garrison every county. Thus, the counties would be left with either no garrison at all or only a token force. They were all singing the empty city stratagem.

"I have heard from Young Master Huang that wherever the 髡 occupy, they recruit 'imitation 髡' to 'civilize' the area," Liang Cunhou continued. "The 髡 have achieved what they have today because the ignorant and unruly masses have joined them and become their vanguard. We cannot afford them that same opportunity here."

They had to seize the moment, before the 髡 could recruit their "imitation 髡" on a large scale. They would send agents to organize and mobilize the local gentry and powerful families, who often maintained their own village militias. If they could unite these forces, they could raise an army of thousands in an instant.

Once they eliminated the county magistrate and the small garrison sent by the 髡, the prestige of the righteous army would soar, and the people of the county would not dare to be incited by the enemy. From one county to several, and then from several counties to the entire region, it would instantly become a prairie fire!

"...At that point, the 髡, with only a few thousand troops, will be stretched thin, trapped in Guangzhou at best. Their trade will be cut off, their food and supplies will dwindle. What use then will be their strong ships and powerful cannons? When the Emperor's heavenly soldiers arrive, they will have no choice but to flee back to Qiongzhou."

Huang Bingkun felt the plan was sound. The 髡 army, though formidable, was small. It could not possibly control a region as vast as Guangdong. If they could truly create a situation where "the entire province raises a righteous army," the 髡 would be denied the time to slowly cultivate their own power base.

"The plan is brilliant, but..." Huang Bingkun said with a note of concern. "I am an outsider. When I arrive in these counties, how can I gain the trust of the gentry? How can I persuade them to raise an army?"

"You need not worry about that," Liang Cunhou said. "I have suitable men on the ground, but they are unfamiliar with the ways of the 髡. They will need you, their 'military advisor,' to assist them."

A thrill went through Huang Bingkun. Though he was only a xiucai, a holder of the lowest imperial degree, he had seen his share of battles with his father: they had fought bandits, pirates, and even neighboring villages over water rights. The fire of his youth was not yet extinguished. For the past few years, he had lived a life of submission under the shadow of the 髡, a fire of resentment smoldering in his belly. The prospect of leading a "righteous army" into battle filled him with a heroic spirit. He stood and cupped his hands. "I, Huang, will not spare my life. I will not fail this mission!"

Liang Cunhou nodded with an appreciative expression, raising his wine cup. "Second Master Huang, I toast you!"

Lin Zunxiu quickly added, "I also toast you." A sense of relief washed over him.

The three men drained their cups. Huang Bingkun then said, "I have one more matter, which I ask Young Master Liang to consider."

"Speak freely."

"We raise this righteous army for the good of the country and the people, but we still need a mandate from the court to rally the populace..."

"You need not worry, Second Master Huang. I will send someone to see to it. Among the high officials of the court, there are already those who have seen through the wolfish ambitions of the 髡. And among the local gentry of Guangzhou, there are also high-minded men who despise them."

"Good!" Huang Bingkun said. "This matter must be handled with haste. Please make the arrangements, Young Master. I will set out tomorrow!"

"Do not be so hasty," Liang Cunhou cautioned. "Though the gates of Guangzhou are open to pedestrians, the inspections are strict. You will be carrying my letter. If it is discovered, it will not be good. In a few days, when the gate controls are relaxed, I will have someone escort you. For now, do not return to your lodgings. Rest here. I will send someone to your inn to take care of matters and bring your servant and luggage."

"He is not my family's servant, but a gift from a friend in Guangzhou. The kindness I have shown him is shallow. This journey will be fraught with danger. If he follows me, he may not have the will to fight to the death and will only be a burden. I ask that Young Master Liang send him away for me. Let him return to his original master if he wishes, or find his own way."

"That will not do. Such an arrangement might reveal your whereabouts. I think it best he remain here, in my mansion," Liang Cunhou said. "I will provide you with another, more capable servant for your journey."

"Thank you, Young Master Liang!"

They discussed the plan for a long time, devising countermeasures for after the 髡 entered the city. Liang Cunhou then had someone escort Huang Bingkun to a guest room before continuing his secret discussion with Lin Zunxiu.

"The 髡 will surely summon all the gentry of the city in the coming days. The others are of little concern, but Mr. Qiutao is the most worrying..."

Chen Zizhuang was the most prominent member of the Guangzhou gentry, a man of high repute. His attitude would influence many.

Lin Zunxiu was confused. "Young Master, you worry too much. Though Mr. Qiutao has offended the Emperor, he can still distinguish right from wrong, loyalty from treachery..."

"That is not my concern!" Liang Cunhou interrupted. "How could I doubt Mr. Qiutao's moral character? But he has a family. If he entertains the idea of feigning compliance with the 髡, their goal will be achieved!"

Lin Zunxiu considered this. Chen Zizhuang would not necessarily commit suicide for his country just because Guangzhou had fallen. When the 髡 came to invite him to a meeting, he would likely refuse on the grounds of illness and close his doors. He would not openly oppose them. The 髡 could then use this to their advantage.

"In that case..."

"We must ask him to avoid the limelight for a while," Liang Cunhou said. "The best plan is to notify him immediately to go into hiding. This task... will fall to you."

Lin Zunxiu was taken aback. "But I have no acquaintance with him..."

With Chen Zizhuang's status, a merchant's son with no notable academic achievements like Lin Zunxiu could not even hope to get close.

"Why do you need an acquaintance?" Young Master Liang smiled. "Your family runs a restaurant. You can simply go on the pretext of delivering a banquet. I have another letter here. He will surely see you then."

He lowered his voice. "This matter is of the utmost importance. I dare not entrust it to anyone else. I can only ask you to make the trip in person."

Since he had put it that way, Lin Zunxiu had no choice but to agree. "I will go tomorrow!"

Liang Cunhou nodded, then asked, "Of the members of your Yuyuan Society, how many are reliable, and how many are not?"

The Yuyuan Society was a mixed bag. While most held the attitude of "using the barbarian's skills to control the barbarians," there were more than a few "elite 髡" who admired 髡 studies and prostrated themselves before the Australians.

It was a difficult question. Lin Zunxiu thought for a moment. "Except for a few, most are still reliable. The 髡 are now open rebels. No matter how muddle-headed they are, surely they would not serve the thieves?"

Young Master Liang shook his head. "They are reliable now, but that may not be the case in a few days. Serving the thieves, recognizing the thieves as one's father—these are common occurrences in every dynasty. Even in the armies of the roving bandits, there are many men in official robes." He picked up a piece of roast duck and chewed it slowly. "The society is full of scholars. The 髡 have just entered the city, and a hundred things need to be done. What they lack is talent..."

A shiver went down Lin Zunxiu's spine. "You mean, the 髡 will lure them with official positions?"

"That is certain," Liang Cunhou sneered. "Do not be fooled by the fact that they have not held civil service examinations in Qiongzhou for many years and only run schools—that is because there are not so many scholars in Qiongzhou. Now that they have arrived in Guangzhou, they will inevitably recruit men in official robes in the name of holding examinations and recruiting talent. At that time, how can those poor students resist? It is one thing for ordinary scholars, but the members of the society are all proficient in 髡 studies. Once they accept a false position, the harm will be immense!"

Lin Zunxiu saw the truth in this. "Then... what should we do?" he asked anxiously.

Young Master Liang took out a leather-bound book from a drawer and removed a few Delong's checks and a list.

"These are Delong's checks. Your family runs a restaurant, so a large withdrawal will not attract attention. You will distribute them according to this list. It is a subsidy from the society. Of course, you must also offer them a few words of reminder. Tell them not to be blinded by the desire for fame and fortune! Do not end up with 'the heart to take, but no life to enjoy'," Liang Cunhou said grimly.

"I understand," Lin Zunxiu said with a sense of awe.

Liang Cunhou stroked his forehead. "The hearts of men are not what they used to be. You cannot move an inch without silver. Even this loyalty must be maintained by silver!" He sighed with emotion.

Lin Zunxiu was silent. Suddenly, Young Master Liang asked, "How is Wu Ming?"

Lin Zunxiu was stunned. "Him? He is very interested in 髡 studies and is also very clever. I heard he has dealings with the 髡 of the Grand World."

Liang Cunhou was silent for a long time. "I will think on it," he said finally.

"I'm afraid this person is not very reliable," Lin Zunxiu said. "He has always been disrespectful to the court, and his words are frivolous."

"That is not surprising. He is conceited and thinks himself smarter than ordinary men. He writes a very flowery eight-legged essay, but he has failed the examinations repeatedly and has not even obtained the title of a supplementary student," Liang Cunhou sighed. "Don't you know that essays have their own fate? He cannot see through this, and so a knot has formed in his chest. I had originally intended to help him in this examination, but heaven did not grant my wish!"

"That is also his bad luck," Lin Zunxiu said.

"Whether he is lucky or not is not the point. We cannot use him at this moment. What a pity!" Liang Cunhou felt it was a great loss. If he had helped him enter the official path this time, he would have obtained a title from the court and been indebted to him. Then he would not have been bewitched by the 髡. "This person is both proficient in 髡 studies and clever. He would have been a great help to us."
