"The choice of what kind of weapon to use depends first on the environment we are in and the enemies we face." Xi Yazhou paused for a moment, probably to organize his thoughts. "We have three main opponents: Han Chinese armed forces, which are mainly composed of infantry with a large number of simple firearms mixed with cold weapons, represented by the Ming army, and also including late Ming roving bandits like Li Zicheng. Their main forces basically come from the rebellious soldiers and deserters of the Ming army, and their equipment and tactics are basically the same; the Manchu Qing army, which is mainly composed of cavalry and equipped with a small number of firearms; and the various Chinese and foreign pirates who are extremely active along the coast of China, mainly using various firearms.

"Not only are we few in number, but we are also basically people with no actual combat experience. In terms of psychological quality, we may not be as strong as these ancients. Therefore, our weapons must adhere to two points:

"A sufficiently long range, so that we can open fire to suppress the enemy's charge at the farthest possible range, and also be used to strike the enemy's artillery gunners and commanders. The 8-pounder and 12-pounder field guns of the Napoleonic era had an effective range of only 900 meters. The level of the 17th century was even lower, estimated to be at most 400 meters. The rifle should at least have this range.

"Our first two opponents will both use cavalry as a shock force in combat, so our weapons must have the ability to project a large amount of ammunition in an instant to suppress the impact of the cavalry. It would be best to use machine guns, but for now, it seems impossible. After listening to the introduction just now, I'm afraid the North American branch can't get machine guns or automatic rifles either."

"Then why doesn't the SKS meet the requirements? I think it meets them all: 400-meter effective range, 10-round magazine, maximum rate of fire of 40 rounds per minute. The performance is not outstanding, but the good thing is that its structure is simple, and everyone has basically handled it before."

"I don't have a good feeling about the 7.62x39mm M43 cartridge," Xi Yazhou chuckled. "This rifle cartridge uses a corrosive primer, which is very corrosive to the barrel and requires frequent wiping and maintenance. The environment in Hainan is harsh in itself. Most of the people here have no military experience and don't know much about firearms. It's very likely that they will let their guns rust into a block because they don't clean them often. They will be scrapped in no time."

"Can a good-for-nothing who doesn't even clean his gun still be a soldier? This reason is too weak, isn't it?"

Xi Yazhou ignored the dissenting voice: "Corrosive primers are also very corrosive to the cartridge case. This has a great impact on reloading ammunition."

"That is something to consider. Reloading ammunition is our only way to replenish ammunition in the early stages."

"The weapons of the Warsaw Pact system are based on the principle of being easy to use and sufficient. In other words, they have the ability to make the weapons better, but they first consider the cost issue. From this perspective, a durable weapon that consumes too many resources does not conform to their military principles."

"In this time and space, of course, it doesn't matter. If a gun breaks, just replace it. But we have no way to supplement new modern weapons, so the full service life of the weapon must be considered."

"Are you saying that the service life of the SKS is too short?"

"That's right, not only the SKS, but also weapons like the AK." He stretched his numb legs and feet. "In addition, the SKS is a standard semi-automatic rifle. It is a standard semi-automatic." Xi Yazhou emphasized this word. "That is to say, it cannot be converted into an automatic rifle."

The people in the meeting were stunned for a moment, then suddenly understood. Even those who had been dismissive of his speech now relaxed their brows.

That's right, there are no automatic weapons on the US civilian gun market, but those semi-automatic rifles based on military automatic rifles, such as the civilian AK/AR, can actually be converted into fully automatic weapons. Of course, US law strictly prohibits this, and offenders are guilty of a felony. But the FBI has no jurisdiction in the Great Ming!

AK-47, M-16, these words that everyone was all too familiar with suddenly flew around the conference room. Everyone fantasized about the heroic posture of themselves wielding an AK or an M-16.

"Then let's buy a large number of civilian AKs!" Shi Niaoren also became excited. "There have been many of these guns on the market since 2004, and the stock is quite sufficient. With our mechanical capabilities, converting the guns is not a problem."

"Why an AK? I want an M-16!"

"What do you know, that's called an AR-15."

"If you convert it, won't it become an M-16?"

"Hehe, I still say the same thing: I'm not optimistic about the M43 cartridge." Xi Yazhou was very satisfied with the effect of his words. "Similarly, I don't recommend using small-caliber rifles like the M-16. It's not just a matter of stopping power, but also involves the power at maximum range. In addition, small-caliber rifle ammunition also has higher production technology requirements. I recommend using a semi-automatic rifle that uses the 7.62mm NATO round, such as the civilian versions of rifles like the M-14 and FN-FAL. If we convert them directly into automatic rifles, there will be no urgent need to equip machine guns."

"M-14? I heard the accuracy is very good, but the power is excessive, and it's also heavy."

"Isn't this gun a bit complicated? It seems that American guns are all complex in structure and difficult to maintain."

The dispute over firearms lasted for half an hour, which bored Shi Niaoren. Seeing that such a debate would have no result, he proposed to talk directly to Little Rui on the internet. After all, Little Rui was more familiar with the US gun market and had seen more strange things in civilian guns, unlike people in China who at most knew that the AR-15 was the semi-automatic civilian version of the M-16.

As a result, Little Rui proposed another type of gun on the internet: the Saiga-308 rifle, which no one had ever heard of. This was a Russian-made civilian semi-automatic rifle that used the 7.62mm NATO round.

An AK that can fire 5.56mm bullets is not uncommon. Even Norinco has exported a Type 56 that uses 5.56mm ammunition. But this kind of semi-automatic rifle with an AK pedigree that uses the full-power rifle cartridge of the American empire is relatively rare.

The Saiga-308 is a civilian sport and hunting rifle specially developed by the Izhevsk factory, the main manufacturer of Kalashnikov firearms, for AK rifle enthusiasts around the world. In appearance, it retains almost all the features of the AK rifle, and its internal parts are basically from the AKM and AK-74. The muzzle adopts the muzzle flash hider specially designed for the SVDS sniper rifle, and the side rail can be mounted with various Soviet and Russian optical sights. The Saiga-308 has good shooting accuracy: when shooting 10 rounds at a distance of 100m, the dispersion circle radius is only 40-45mm. The reliability of the weapon is also higher than that of an ordinary AK. To address the problem of the excessive energy of the 7.62mm NATO round, a special buffer pad is installed at the back of the stock, which is quite effective. An ordinary adult male shooting a long gun for the first time has no problem.

"This gun has good performance, sufficient power, and a long effective range. The empty gun weighs 3.6kg. The standard is an 8-round magazine, but it can also be equipped with a 20-round magazine and a large-capacity drum magazine." Shi Niaoren relayed Little Rui's proposal. "The price is not expensive, the unit price is $500. If we buy in large quantities, we can get a discount. Of course, we can also buy the M1A—that is, the civilian version of the M-14, which is much more expensive, with a market price of over $1000."

"So Little Rui is suggesting we choose the Saiga-308?"

"He didn't say that," Shi Niaoren was a shrewd person, a slippery workplace elite. This kind of matter of choosing weapons was a major national affair. If the choice was appropriate, it was just a reasonable suggestion. If the choice was bad and caused trouble later, the mistake would be all yours. Even if the leadership could forgive you, the masses would not understand. "It's just a suggestion for everyone. The specific decision still depends on the Executive Committee."

This was equivalent to kicking the ball back to the Executive Committee. Everyone was discussing animatedly, unable to make a decision. Compared with the passionate discussion of the amateurs, no one in the Sports Group, except for Xi Yazhou, was interested in this issue at all. In their view, the Type 56 carbine was good enough. Why bring up so many inexplicable things?

"Are bolt-action rifles not an option?" [Chief Wen][y002] remembered seeing a gun show when he was traveling in the United States in the past. There were as many antique rifles of all kinds as ox hair: Mausers, Springfields, Mosin-Nagants... everything you could think of. And the prices were very cheap. Such rifles, with long bayonets, and soldiers in black high hats and red and yellow wool uniforms marching slowly in ranks, that would be a magnificent sight.

However, he knew that it was impossible for the transmigrators to do this, so he didn't mention this little hobby.

The 7.62 NATO vs. 7.62 Warsaw Pact debate still had no result in this meeting. In the end, six different plans were summarized:

1.  Adopt the SKS semi-automatic.
2.  Adopt the M1A (M-14) semi-automatic.
3.  Adopt the Saiga-308.
4.  Adopt the civilian semi-automatic versions of the AK-47/74 or M-16, to be converted to full-auto later. There were different opinions on whether to choose the AK or the M-16.
5.  Simultaneously adopt a high-power long-range rifle and an intermediate-power rifle or a small-caliber rifle.
6.  Adopt a bolt-action rifle.

Obviously, each plan had its supporters, and each plan had its pros and cons. Just as the discussion was beginning to turn unfriendly, [Wen Desi][y002] timely shifted the topic to personal self-defense weapons.

The Sports Group had originally prepared daggers as the personal self-defense solution for everyone, but now with the golden finger of the North American Branch, they couldn't help but want to be extravagant. Handguns are very popular in the US civilian market, and there are many models to choose from. However, for the sake of simplifying equipment and facilitating repairs and parts interchangeability, only one type of handgun could be chosen.

There was no objection to using the 9mm Parabellum round. After all, it was a mainstream handgun ammunition. As for the handgun itself, most people leaned towards the M9—the reason being that it looked cool and was well-known. The heroic image of Brother Mark was unforgettable for this generation. The M1911 also had supporters, but it was slightly heavier and not liked by most of the petty bourgeoisie. As for the PPK, S&W revolvers, and Glocks, they all had their fans.

For the sake of being easy to use, light, and easy to maintain, the Executive Committee had originally intended to choose the S&W 9mm revolver. It had all the disadvantages of a revolver: gas leakage, short range, low ammunition capacity, and slow reloading. However, from the Executive Committee's point of view, this thing was only for self-defense within twenty or thirty meters anyway, and did not require outstanding performance. The key was to be simple and durable.

The problem was that the Sports Group clearly did not like this weapon. The PLA had never had a tradition of using revolvers, and everyone was not confident enough in this thing. Moreover, the shape of the revolver was obviously not cool enough. The sight of this gun reminded most transmigrators of the under-powered Royal Hong Kong Police. In the end, the compromise was that both the M9 and the S&W M337 were included in the procurement list.
