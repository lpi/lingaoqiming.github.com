*One year later.*

*A sprawling city in Southern China.*

Guo Yi arrived at his office late. He was a civil servant of the Republic, a cog in the vast machine of state, and his tardiness was a small, private rebellion. A reunion with old classmates the night before had stretched into the early hours, fueled by more alcohol than camaraderie.

Such gatherings were a peculiar ritual of middle age. The successful held court, their boasts echoing in the stale air. The failures simply stayed away. It was for those like him, caught in the stagnant middle, that the evenings were most trying. The successful pitied him for his comfortable, ambitionless life; the unsuccessful scorned him as a parasite on the public purse.

On his desk sat the day's harvest of social anxieties: reports and bulletins on the latest trends in public sentiment. Guo Yi's department was tasked with the Sisyphean chore of maintaining stability, unity, and harmony. He sifted through the usual litany of petty grievances and local squabbles until he found a file flagged for his attention. It was a bulletin from a coastal city in Guangdong.

For nearly a year, it read, a peculiar group had occupied a disused maritime militia base. They drilled day and night—marching, running, chanting slogans into the late hours. A pyramid scheme, the initial report had suggested, but the Administration for Industry and Commerce had found no evidence. The local police had paid a visit and found nothing illegal. The man in charge, one [Wen Desi][y002], had produced a valid business license for a company established over a year ago. The base, he explained, was leased for pre-employment training.

Still, the file radiated a low hum of suspicion. It had percolated up through the bureaucratic channels until it landed on his superior's desk, who had scrawled a simple directive: "Look into it."

Guo Yi pulled [Wen Desi][y002]'s file. The man was unremarkable. An engineer in his thirties with a solid income, a passion for travel, history, and military paraphernalia. A self-proclaimed "survivalist," the kind who probably had a cellar full of canned goods for the inevitable nuclear winter. His record was clean, not so much as a parking ticket.

His company, "Transmigration Trading," was registered with a capital of one million yuan. A check of his bank records confirmed it was his own money. The company's transactions were a flurry of normal, if bizarre, activity. The expenses were mundane: salaries, utilities, office supplies. But the purchases...

Guo Yi spent the afternoon chasing ghosts through a labyrinth of databases. He couldn't shake the feeling of an itch he couldn't scratch. This was his peculiar talent, his curse. He loved the archives, the dusty scent of old paper and forgotten secrets. It had made him enemies, cost him promotions, and left him a permanent fixture in the department's backwaters while others rose on waves of manufactured merit.

He started with the company's call logs. The phone lines were constantly busy, a web of connections spreading across the country. He traced the landline numbers first. They led him to a bewildering array of small and medium-sized enterprises, research institutes, design academies, and trading firms. The sheer breadth of it was staggering.

They bought generators, small hydropower systems, and substation equipment. Normal enough. But they also purchased multiple wind power systems with a massive inventory of spare parts. They showed an insatiable appetite for blueprints and technical data, everything from industrial machinery to the manufacturing processes for condoms and sanitary napkins. But it was never the high-tech, cutting-edge stuff. They were obsessed with simple, outdated, even primitive technologies.

*Was this some new form of industrial espionage? Money laundering?* The pieces refused to fit. It was as if they were building something, but the blueprint was written in a language he couldn't comprehend. What grand secret could this elaborate, nonsensical smokescreen be hiding?

He decided to go see for himself. A business trip. A change of scenery.

***

The county town was a microcosm of modern China, a chaotic blend of prosperity and desperation. The bus station square was a river of humanity, a tide of migrant workers and dreamers carrying their lives in dusty bags. Among them, for the past six months, had been other, stranger visitors—men and women with hushed voices and furtive glances, clutching maps and scraps of paper.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] stood at the station exit, holding a piece of a cardboard fruit box. On it, scrawled in clumsy brushstrokes, were two words: "Transmigration Trading." His once-plump face was leaner now, tanned by the relentless sun. He wore a sweat-stained promotional T-shirt and a frayed straw hat. A former white-collar drone, now an unemployed recruiter for a dream. Was he mad? Or was he living in the most elaborate, absurd fantasy of all time? He knew only that more and more people were coming to share it.

Guo Yi emerged from the station into the searing September heat. His eyes scanned the crowd and landed on the cardboard sign. "Transmigration Trading." He locked eyes with the man holding it. In that fleeting instant, a current passed between them, a silent acknowledgment. Guo Yi was not here to join their dream.

Years in sales had honed [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s instincts. The man's gaze was sharp, his posture calm and assured. His clothes were understated but neat, his luggage minimal. This was a man from the government, a man with authority. And he was watching.

Before the thought could fully form, a tall, overweight young man, laden with bags, lumbered toward him.

"Transmigration Company?"

"Yes. You are?"

"I'm here to transmigrate..." the young man blurted out.

A cold sweat broke out on [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s brow. *Idiot! You don't have to announce it to the whole province!* "Right... uh... where has the People's Liberation Army swept through?" The countersign was a ridiculous piece of theater, some founder's obsession with spy movie tropes.

"Asia, Asia!" the young man boomed, caught up in the thrill of arrival. "I'm Meng Xian!"

"I know, I know..." [Xiao Zishan][y001] hissed, his voice low. "The parking lot. Minibus, license plate XXXXXX."

"Where's [Director Wen][y002]..."

"You'll see him. I have to wait for the others." He glanced around nervously. The crowd swirled around them, indifferent. The man from the government was gone. But a knot of unease remained. He would have to report this.

From a discreet distance, Guo Yi watched them. He couldn't hear their words, but the dynamic was clear: a clandestine meeting, a secret shared. He followed the enthusiastic Meng Xian to the parking lot and noted the minibus's license plate. The bus didn't leave. More were coming.

That night, in his sterile hotel room, Guo Yi lay exhausted, his mind a maelstrom of conflicting data. He ignored the calls offering "stress-relieving massages" and "newly arrived little sisters." He was adrift in a sea of facts that refused to form a coherent narrative.

He drifted into a fitful sleep and dreamed. He saw [Wen Desi][y002], dressed in a strange, flowing robe, standing on the deck of a great ship as it cut through stormy seas. In the distance, a lush green island rose from the waves—a vision of blue sky, white clouds, turquoise water, and silver sand. A promised land.
