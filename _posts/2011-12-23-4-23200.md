Yang Shixiang's mouth was agape with surprise. Opening a pharmacy in Jiangnan was something his ancestors had never dared to dream of, even at the height of their prosperity. Not to mention that his family had no connections in Jiangnan, there was also the competition in the industry: old, established pharmacies in Jiangnan were as numerous as ox hair, each with their own secret ointments, pills, and powders passed down for many years, and they were all well-funded. Although Liu San's several patent medicines had brought a steady stream of profits to the Runshitang, he really didn't have the courage to wade into this muddy water.

Seeing his sworn brother's indecision, Liu San encouraged him, "Big brother, with us backing you, what are you afraid of? We'll stick to the same path: only sell patent medicines, not raw herbs. That way, we won't have much to do with the local pharmaceutical tycoons."

The construction of the Runshitang's pharmaceutical factory in the Bairen Development Zone had been halted for several months due to the war. After the great victory at Chengmai, the construction resumed. The various specialized equipment manufactured by the machinery factory had been basically installed and was undergoing debugging and trial production. Once completed, the production capacity of the Runshitang pharmaceutical factory would be 20 to 30 times higher than the current manual production. This terrifying projected output made Yang Shixiang hesitant. The terrifying monster of the capital chain was now right in front of him.

Huge production capacity meant a large amount of capital was needed to pay for raw materials, a large amount of freight to transport goods to various places for sale, and the need to open stores or find agents in various places, and to stock a large amount of inventory in the stores... If there was a problem in any link, it would be a disaster. This was not like the current business with his cousin, where he only sold goods in two or three cities. Yang Shixiang had been ambitious when he was down and out, but now that he had become the richest man in Lin'gao, he had become a little timid.

At the dinner table, Li Mei had already proposed that she could arrange for help in obtaining a loan. Wu Di from the Delong Bank's credit department had reached an agreement with Li Mei to act as a loan intermediary, with the Ministry of Commerce and the East Gate Market Management Office selecting and recommending high-quality customers for loans.

Yang Shixiang was a little hesitant because the construction of the Runshitang pharmaceutical factory itself had already incurred a loan from the Australians: for the purchase of land, machinery and equipment, and construction costs. It was agreed that this loan would be secured by the pharmaceutical factory itself, with an annual interest rate of 17%. Now, to expand the business, he would have to take out another loan, which could only be secured by the assets of the Runshitang itself. This made him somewhat uneasy.

It was Li Mei who understood his meaning. She said slowly, "You don't have to be in such a hurry. We'll do it step by step, steadily. Doesn't your brother own half of the Runshitang? Your brother is an Elder, an Elder of our Council of Elders. We are all like brothers and sisters. If you have difficulties, the Council of Elders will definitely help..."

Business is best discussed at the dinner table. The three of them took turns, and Yang Shixiang finally agreed to fully cooperate with the Elders' business expansion plan. However, he felt a little overwhelmed by such a complex business plan. He complained to Liu San that he had a headache just thinking about how to manage and operate the business after it expanded. He hoped that Liu San could personally become the general manager of the Runshitang to help him share the burden, and he was even willing to give Liu San a few more shares of the company.

Liu San thought to himself, it's useless no matter how much you give me—this is all state-owned property. Besides, he didn't want to leave his position in the Ministry of Health to go to a private enterprise, not to mention that the Organization Department would not agree. He immediately declined tactfully. However, he then seized the opportunity to persuade Yang Shixiang to send the young servants and clerks in his family to Fangcaodi to attend short-term training classes. These training classes specialized in teaching practical skills, including accounting, business management, and agricultural technology. Illiterate natives had to first attend a class for the Class C diploma. According to the requirements, naturalized citizens who wanted to attend these classes were free of charge, while ordinary natives had to pay a certain amount of tuition.

"A few young children, even if they learn, they can't become managers right away," Yang Shixiang sighed. "Although there are a few clerks who are quite mature and reliable, they are still a bit lacking in experience. I'm not at ease sending them out to work independently."

"We will naturally help with this matter," Li Mei immediately said. If needed, the Ministry of Commerce was willing to "second" several managers to serve the Runshitang—the Runshitang would just have to pay their salaries.

They ate, drank, chatted, and discussed matters at the dinner table. The banquet did not end until the afternoon. The matter was more or less settled, and they were just waiting to sign the contract the next day. Li Mei also formally sent Yang Shixiang an invitation, inviting him to attend the New Year's reception at the end of the year. Liu San used the excuse of being drunk and wanting to take a nap to stay at the Runshitang. Li Mei and Jiang Shan tactfully took their leave.

How could Yang Shixiang not know his sworn brother's intentions? He immediately sent someone to take him to Liu San's private courtyard and had Xuan Chun go to serve him.

Having received the Elders' assurance, Yang Shixiang's worries were all settled, and his heart was greatly relieved. Just as he was about to go to the study to take a nap and sober up, a maid came to ask him to go to the main house.

"It's broad daylight, what's the matter?" Like the large households of this time and place, Yang Shixiang's family did not see each other during the day unless there was a specific matter. After waking up and washing, Yang Shixiang would go to the front study, have breakfast with the accountant and manager, and handle business. His wife managed the household in the inner courtyard. They would only meet in the evening for dinner, and then eat and sleep together. Even the children, after they grew up a little, would not live with their mother but would have their own residences. They would only see each other for morning and evening greetings. This was the "norm" for large households, and the Yang family was no exception.

"The mistress said there is an urgent matter that needs to be discussed with you, master."

"Alright, I'll go right away," Yang Shixiang replied and followed the maid to the main house in the inner courtyard.

Before he could even sit down, his wife bombarded him with questions, "Master, do you know about Xuan Chun's matter?"

"Know what?" Yang Shixiang was taken aback, not knowing what his wife meant by this sudden question.

"So you still don't know!" his wife said in a scolding tone.

"She is a woman, and not our family's maid. What does her business have to do with me?" Xuan Chun was the maid of his wife's maternal cousin's family, a true "guest." According to family law, she indeed had nothing to do with the Yang family.

"Today, Third Sister's family sent someone to tell me that Xuan Chun—is with child..." his wife lowered her voice and said secretively.

"With child? With what child?" Yang Shixiang said carelessly, then suddenly understood. "You mean, she's pregnant?"

"Yes!" his wife nodded. "Third Sister wants us to make a decision—what should we do with Xuan Chun? It was your idea to have her serve Uncle. Now that she's pregnant, she can't just continue like this without a clear status."

"Hmm, hmm." Yang Shixiang had only thought of winning over his sworn brother and had not considered the possibility of Xuan Chun getting pregnant. He had the temperament of a young master, never in a hurry about anything. After a few "hmms," he finally said, "Is this matter true? Have you checked her pulse?"

"She has missed her period for two months. What's the point of checking her pulse?"

"Otherwise... a woman's missed period is not necessarily pregnancy. The so-called qi and blood..."

"Alright, stop reciting your medical books. If you don't believe it, go and check her pulse yourself," his wife said angrily.

"I'll check her pulse tonight," Yang Shixiang nodded. "But my sworn brother's medical skills are superior to mine. He probably already knows."

"It's a matter between a man and a woman. It was bound to happen sooner or later. Now that it's out, you should discuss with Uncle as soon as possible how to deal with Xuan Chun."

"Are the dates right?" Yang Shixiang suddenly became alarmed. This was no small matter!

"Yes, your humble wife has checked the guest book and calculated the dates. Uncle did indeed stay over on those days."

"Hmm, that's good!"

"What are you worried about? Is the inner courtyard a place where any man can just walk in?" his wife complained. "Third Sister's young master is only nine years old. You wouldn't suspect him, would you?"

"My dear wife, we can't be careless about such matters!" Yang Shixiang said in a low voice. "If there's a mistake, it's not just a joke. It could lead to a major incident."

The Australians were now the local emperors of Lin'gao—and it seemed that they would soon be the local emperors of the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture. They held the power of life and death.

His wife's expression became tense. "Your humble wife understands! I have already investigated secretly, and there are no accidents."

Yang Shixiang thought it over. The most ideal solution, of course, was to have his sworn brother take Xuan Chun into his home. It was not a long-term solution to have another man's woman in his own house—especially with a child! But Liu San's wife was an Elder, and he had heard that she was a fierce and jealous woman. Liu San might not dare to do it. If the matter got out, it was not impossible that his own family would also be implicated. Yang Shixiang felt a wave of nervousness, but then he thought that there were few female Elders, and he had heard from Liu San that his wife was an "idle person" and not someone in power. He was a "close partner" of the Council of Elders, so they probably wouldn't do anything to him.

Since he had already offended Liu San's wife, he had to curry favor with Liu San to not lose out! Yang Shixiang made up his mind. "I think the proper way is to let her stay in our house, have the child, and it will be like his brother's second home..."

His wife complained, "You are so muddle-headed. How can a second home be set up in someone else's house? This mother and child living in our house, with no name and no status, how will they face people in the future?"

Yang Shixiang thought for a moment. "In that case, we'll buy another house in the city. We'll move Xuan Chun there first, and then find a few mature and reliable servants to accompany her. We'll cover all the expenses! As for what happens after that, it's my brother's own family matter."

His wife nodded. "That's the only way. But we also have to give Third Sister an explanation. Xuan Chun is, after all, from her family."

Xuan Chun's master's family was so down and out that they relied on the Yang family to get by. They couldn't question any of the Yang family's decisions. Even so, the face between relatives had to be maintained. Yang Shixiang thought for a moment and said carelessly, "We'll just buy Xuan Chun—change her indenture, to save them the trouble."
