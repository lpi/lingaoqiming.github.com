The seventh year of Tianqi, 1627 AD.

This month, the Later Jin attacked Korea, forcing it to submit. The Great Ming's vassal state to the east of the sea fell into the hands of the Jurchens.

In the fifth month, Huang Taiji attacked Ningyuan and Jinzhou but was repelled by the Ming army, a victory known at the time as the Great Victory of Ning-Jin. This led Huang Taiji to change his strategy, deciding to bypass the Ning-Jin-Shanhai Pass defense line and directly invade and plunder within the pass. In the subsequent seventeen years of the Chongzhen reign, he would invade through the pass five times, bringing devastation to the Central Plains and adding frost to the snow for the already precarious Ming Dynasty.

In the seventh month, the Tianqi Emperor fell gravely ill, and the once all-powerful Nine-Thousand-Year-Old began his final journey. In the eleventh month of that year, Wei Zhongxian's property was confiscated, and he committed suicide. The fall of the eunuch faction brought a fleeting moment of hope to the political sky of the late Ming, only to disappear like a shooting star. Cutting out a rotten sore could not bring a patient already riddled with decay back to life. The Great Ming—this last Han Chinese dynasty of the Central Plains—was powerless to turn the tide and embarked on the road to destruction.

The three transmigrators were speechless for a moment, the atmosphere somewhat heavy.

Master Gao coughed lightly, stroked his beard, and slowly asked, "Since you esteemed guests are sea merchants, do you have any goods to sell?"

[Wen Desi][y002] and [Xiao Zishan][y001] exchanged a glance—they were getting to the point. This glance was keenly caught by Master Gao.

"We do indeed have some goods we would like to sell, but we are new here and do not know the channels..." [Wen Desi][y002] feigned difficulty.

"Haha, that's easy to say," Master Gao laughed. "I have been in the business of foreign goods in this city of Guangzhou for many years. If you, sir, can trust me, I can be of service in this matter."

"Then I shall trouble you, Master Gao," [Wen Desi][y002] said with great joy.

"These are our samples," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said softly, taking out the items from his backpack one by one.

Having seen the powder box, Master Gao was extremely interested in these people's goods. First was the kind of powder box he had seen before, only this one was a sickly pale green. Then there were completely transparent glass cups with some nice patterns on them. Although the transparency of these cups was far superior to any cup Master Gao had ever seen, it did not exceed his scope of cognition, so he was a little disappointed. Next were a few miscellaneous porcelain items. The appearance and glaze were not outstanding. Picking one up, he felt it was very light, and the feel was not the coldness of porcelain, so he knew it was not the same thing. Just as he was thinking that this item was not very valuable, [Xiao Zishan][y001] seemed to know his thoughts and pushed the several bowls and dishes to the ground. Master Gao was startled, but he saw that these things did not shatter into pieces on his tiled floor, but just rolled around a few times, completely unscathed.

A nearby servant quickly picked up the items. Master Gao snatched them over and examined them carefully for a long time. There was not a single crack or chip. He thought to himself that these people's things were truly strange.

Next were some transparent boxes, both square and round, all with tight-fitting lids. Although they were very similar to the glassware Master Gao had bought from the Franks, they were much lighter and not afraid of being dropped.

There were also some shiny little knives, and a hooded cloak made of a material that looked a bit like glass but was waterproof like oilcloth... all sorts of strange things. Gao Ju looked at the dazzling array of things on the table, his heart filled with both surprise and joy. He was happy that the goods brought out were all rare and strange things that could be sold for a good price with a quick turnover. He was afraid that this group of people behaved furtively and their background was unclear. After a moment of hesitation, the desire to make a big profit overcame his misgivings. On second thought, he himself was in the business of smuggling foreign goods. Whether they were Franks or Australians, what difference did it make? Since these people had come to his mansion, there was no reason to push away a windfall.

"I wonder how much silver you wish to sell these strange goods for?" Having made up his mind, Master Gao asked cautiously.

[Wen Desi][y002] pointed to the commonly used wonder-product in transmigration novels: the glass cup, and said, "This cup, one thousand taels each."

According to the three men's thinking, this fair-skinned Ming Dynasty master should have bought this rare treasure without hesitation. Unexpectedly, they saw his face full of astonishment, looking at them as if they were a few madmen.

"This is truly expensive," Master Gao shook his head repeatedly. "This kind of glassware, the Franks in Macau also sell. A large glass bowl or bottle is no more than three taels each. A small one is no more than one tael. This cup..." he shook his head repeatedly, the implication being that it was worth three taels at most.

The few of them were instantly as if doused with ice water, looking at each other in dismay. It turned out that the ultimate transmigration product—the glass cup—was not valuable...

[Xiao Zishan][y001] saw that the deal was about to fall through. He figured that their own estimate was wrong, so he cupped his hands and said, "We have lived overseas for a long time and do not know the market conditions here. We ask Master Gao to enlighten us."

Gao Ju thought this meant they wanted him to name his own price. He pondered for a moment and gave his prices:

Powder box, ten taels of silver each.

Glass cup, one tael each.

Melamine bowls and dishes, five qian for large, two qian for small, spoons and the like, one qian.

Plastic lunch box, three taels each.

Plastic raincoat, one qian each.

Small knife, five qian each.

The traditional transmigration profit-making artifact, the glass cup, had suffered a crushing defeat! One thousand taels had become one tael. The drop was too great. A diamond had turned into glass.

On the other hand, the inconspicuous little plastic powder box was what appealed to the Ming Dynasty merchant. It was clear that one could not make assumptions in business at any time. [Xiao Zishan][y001] then asked about the maritime trade in Guangzhou, and at the same time tried to gauge the other party's opinion of his own goods.

It turned out that the overseas trade in Guangzhou was monopolized by the Franks. No matter where the foreign merchants came from, their ships could only anchor in Macau, wait to be measured and taxed, and then they could sell their goods. Only Frankish merchants could enter Guangzhou city to trade. In the city, there were thirty-six guilds specializing in exports that did business with them, ordering large quantities of porcelain, raw silk, white sugar, and other various goods every year.

However, merchants like Master Gao on Haopan Street had another way. Although Master Gao did not say it explicitly, [Xiao Zishan][y001] had read about it in later documents.

Master Gao was most interested in the mirror in the powder box. He said that occasionally Franks would also sell these things. A large mirror could fetch a price of several hundred taels. Although their small mirror was a bit smaller, it was much clearer and brighter than the mirrors from the West. If there were larger sizes, the price would be negotiable. As for the "soft porcelain"—the melamine bowls and dishes—in terms of texture, feel, and pattern, there was nothing special about them, but they were good for being light and unbreakable. The "soft glass bowls," that is, the plastic lunch boxes, although unbreakable, were not as crystal clear as glass bowls. As for the plastic raincoats and small knives, in Master Gao's eyes, they were just some toys.

The group was ashamed: even with our proud hundreds of years of advanced knowledge, we may not be better than others.

In the conversation, Master Gao also tried to probe in many ways, asking about the customs and conditions of Australia. [Xiao Zishan][y001] was just perfunctory, only saying that their country favored the color blue, that there were many skilled craftsmen in the country who were good at making strange and ingenious goods, that it was a nation founded on industry and commerce, and that the people were fond of empty talk, often forming their own factions under various names and promoting their own opinions. But they were a disorderly mob, and would dissolve on their own after a short time. When asked who the ruler of the country was, he said that the country had a ruler, called "Bachi" (Eight Chi), and under him was a powerful prime minister who was in charge of military and civil affairs, called "Xiaomi" (Little Millet). And that everyone in the country, regardless of their status, all bowed down to a divine messenger named "A-Da-Mi" (Ah, Big Rice). Master Gao listened with clicks of his tongue in amazement.

As they talked, the three of them had long since forgotten their vigilance about not drinking the tea. When they got up to leave, they had even drunk the tea dregs. This made Master Gao despise them in his heart. Before they left, they had settled the deal. The "Australian sea merchants" would supply the first batch of goods in three days, and also promised to bring more novelties.

Only, the departure of the three made Master Gao very suspicious again: these three people refused to go out the main gate, insisting on going to a secluded place in the backyard, and also wanted everyone to leave. Master Gao was not at ease and sent a bold and meticulous servant to watch from a distance: he saw the three people look around furtively for a while, then suddenly turn into a corner behind a wall. By the time the servant rushed up to check, they were gone without a trace.

[Note: The price of glassware comes from Wang Shizhen's "Miscellaneous Records of Fengzhou." The original price unit was the guan. This was the price in the Jiajing era, but I could not find the price for the 17th century, so I am using it as a substitute for now. Please do not delve too deeply into it. If you know, please enlighten me.]
