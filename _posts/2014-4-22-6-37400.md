Huang Ande listened patiently to his brothers' complaints without saying a word. In general, his brothers were not doing very well in Lingao. Since most of them had no special skills, they were either soldiers or laborers. The only one who was doing well was Old Lü. Although Huang Ande felt that the chiefs must have their reasons for arranging things this way, his brothers who had gone through life and death with Old Huang felt that they had been wronged.

Cao Qing said, "Brother Huang, we should all come and be your personal soldiers. We are all brothers who have crawled out of a pile of dead bodies with Brother Huang, and we can all be trusted. It's better to be a soldier for the Australians than to suffer in a factory."

Huang Ande knew that the chiefs were most wary of forming cliques in private. He quickly said that there was no such thing as personal soldiers or family retainers in the Australian army. If they really wanted to be soldiers, they could sign up during the next recruitment drive. But he didn't know where they would be assigned.

He felt that what Huang Xiong had said was a bad sign, so he decided to take this opportunity to persuade everyone.

"Brother! Although you've had bad luck and your career has been delayed, the chiefs haven't forgotten your merits. Didn't they still recruit you into the training class? If they had really forgotten, they would have left you to grow moldy in the White Horse Team. Do you still remember Gao Sanleng, old brother?"

"How could I not remember? He was a sergeant in the security regiment back then, and also a deserter from North Zhili. I even fought with him at Baitu Village," Huang Xiong still had an impression of this fellow countryman. "I heard he was discharged after being injured in the Battle of Chengmai."

"I saw him last month. He's missing an arm, and his leg is a bit lame. The chiefs have arranged for him to be a gatekeeper at a factory," Huang Ande poured Huang Xiong a glass of wine. "Brother, although you're not doing very well, at least you're in one piece. You're an officer, and now you have a wife. You'll have a son soon. What does Gao Sanleng have? He'll probably be a gatekeeper for the rest of his life, and it's hard to say if he'll ever get married. Not to mention the brothers who died in battle. In terms of hard work, is yours greater than his?"

Huang Xiong drank his wine silently. He seemed to be a little moved. Huang Ande continued, "I'm not from the old security regiment, but many from the old security regiment have died or been maimed. Last time, our company went to Cuigang to sweep the graves. The whole slope was covered with tombstones, row after row. When a person dies, they just occupy such a small piece of land. To be honest, we are much better off than them, aren't we?"

Huang Xiong nodded. "That's right! You can't compare."

Huang Ande slapped his thigh. "That's it." He glanced at everyone. "Most of us brothers came from Penglai. As Brother Cao said, we crawled out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood... Think about the common people who died, and the family, relatives, friends, and neighbors who were trapped in Dengzhou Town... Now we are still alive, we have food to eat, and a safe place to sleep... We should be grateful and content."

His words calmed everyone down a lot. Huang Ande then said a few more words to comfort everyone. The chiefs' enterprise was just starting out, and it was clear that the Great Ming was on its last legs. If they worked hard, they would all have a bright future.

Just as everyone was chatting idly at the dinner table, there was a knock on the door. Cao Qing slapped his thigh. "It's that coward Old Lü."

Huang Ande opened the door and saw Old Lü standing outside, holding a large food box in his left hand and a jar of wine in his right. He had a silly smile on his face. "Brother Huang, Brother Cao, Fourth Brother Zhu, sister-in-law—" Old Lü came into the room and greeted everyone one by one, even Huang Xiong and Wang Bao'er, whom he didn't know. He bowed in the manner of the chiefs.

"Old Lü, why are you always the coward! You're a real old coward," Cao Qing was the first to question him.

"Hey, Brother Cao, it's not that I wanted to be late. The closing time today was just that late. I rushed over as soon as I got off work. Fortunately, the road here is flat and wide, so I got here so quickly."

"Tsk, you're just enjoying yourself and forgetting about your brothers. We all fought our way out of Dengzhou together. Now you're the one who's doing the best. You were the first to arrive in Lingao, and you became a full-time employee. Tell me, did you bribe some chief?"

"Hey, hey, hey, don't talk nonsense. All the brothers know that Old Lü never flatters. Besides, the chiefs don't like flatterers," Huang Ande quickly came to mediate.

"Brother Li, you've wronged me, Old Lü. That day on that Korean island, a large group of people were squatting and sitting. The chief asked who could read and who was a craftsman. I thought that my old mother had taught me to read a few words, and my family had also been blacksmiths, so I stood up. The chief then brought me to Lingao first, shaved my head, and made me a full-time employee, working in the big iron factory."

"Then you shouldn't be eating alone," the crowd accused Old Lü. Old Lü just sat at the table with a silly smile, not answering.

"Old Lü, have a drink to wet your throat," a gentle voice said from beside him.

"Yue'e, oh no, sister-in-law, thank you," he took the glass awkwardly, took a small sip, and quickly put it on the table, not daring to look at Zhu Si's fiery eyes.

Back in the Dengzhou camp, Old Lü, because he had some skills, was often asked by Zheng Yue'e to do some repairs. Her attitude towards him was better than towards ordinary men, which left a lasting impression on Zhu Si.

The crowd clamored that Old Lü was late and, according to the chiefs' rules here, had to be punished with three glasses of wine. So Old Lü was immediately forced to drink three full glasses of jackfruit spirits—Xue Ziliang boasted that it was jackfruit brandy. After the wine went down, Old Lü also became bolder and said, "Brothers, Brother Huang, it's not that I wanted to be late. I'm busy from morning to night. Except for lunch and dinner when I can eat and rest, I have no free time."

With that, Old Lü seemed to relax. He took the chopsticks handed to him by Wang Bao'er, chewed on a piece of roast duck, and continued, "And the chiefs are very strict. They hate it when people are late or leave early. If you're late for half an incense stick's time, you'll be fined. You all know that I also have a large family to support. If I'm fined, my family will have to go hungry for a meal." He smacked his lips and picked up another piece of sausage to chew on. The crowd knew he was telling the truth, and their desire to tease him faded.

After drinking, Old Lü became more talkative. "They say the pay is good at the big iron factory, but you have to be alive to spend the money. People die in that factory every month, and they die in all sorts of strange ways! Yesterday, Old Chou, a loader on our side, was pushing a cart on the road when he clutched his chest and squatted down. By the time someone saw him and went to help, he was already dead! He was usually as strong as an ox. If it weren't for my family, I would have quit..."

He held up his glass. "Speaking of pleasant work, it was better to be a blacksmith in the Penglai camp. Although it was busy, it wasn't so tense. We worked for a while and then rested for a few days. When there was no work, we could just lie at home and sleep, and no one would care..."

Cao Qing said, "Cut it out. You talk so freely now. Did you forget how you almost fainted from hunger and fell into the furnace when you were forced by the officials to make cannonballs?"

"I haven't forgotten, I haven't forgotten," Old Lü said quickly. "If only the Great Ming had a few decent officials to govern properly. It would be so good if everyone had food to eat and could serve peacefully!"

This remark once again resonated with everyone.

"That's right, who wants to leave their hometown? The weather here is also particularly hot and humid. I'm still not used to it."

"I think the emperor is quite wise. He arrested the great traitor Wei Zhongxian as soon as he ascended the throne. But the officials below are too outrageous. They don't treat us soldiers like human beings..."

"What does it matter to you whether Wei Zhongxian was a great traitor or not? After Wei Zhongxian was killed, we were still the same poor soldiers. The general is still the general, and we are still owed our pay. What good does it do you?"

"Why else would you say the Great Ming is finished?" Huang Ande said. "We common people just want to have enough to eat and wear, a safe place to sleep, and to get married and have children. But under the rule of the Zhu emperor, even this is impossible!"

Huang Xiong nodded. "Brother is right. Why else would I, a good military officer, come to Lingao? It's not because I wanted to."

Wang Qisuo asked curiously, "Brother Huang was also a military officer of the court? Tell us quickly."

Huang Xiong was a little proud. Among them, he had the highest rank in the Great Ming. When he fled after killing someone, he was already a Bazong. Although he was a minor military officer, he was still someone who could lead a few personal soldiers into battle, wear armor, and have a warhorse.

However, he shook his head. "A mere Bazong, what kind of official is that? I couldn't even get my pay, and I even killed someone by mistake!" He sighed. "It's really not worth it to risk your life for the court..."

"No matter how worthless it is, you were still a court official. What are you now? Wearing a two-and-a-half-foot cloth jacket..." Wang Bao'er muttered in the kitchen.

Huang Xiong's face changed drastically. He cursed, "You won't starve, you damn woman! After a few full meals, you don't even know your own surname! What are you blabbering about?!"

After his curse, the kitchen suddenly fell silent. After a while, he could hear someone sobbing softly, and Zheng Yue'e was comforting her in a low voice. The atmosphere at the dinner table became a little cold.

Huang Ande patted Huang Xiong's shoulder meaningfully. "Old brother, your wife's thinking..."

Huang Xiong smiled wryly and nodded. He took out a cigarette and lit it, took a deep drag, and after a long time, he said in a low voice, "Brother, getting a wife is something you have to be careful about. Look at me now..." He sighed heavily. "Forget it, she's a good girl. Although she didn't really want to be with me, she's about to be the mother of my child. We men should be more tolerant."

"As the saying goes, a virtuous wife brings few misfortunes to her husband. With your wife's unguarded mouth, you have to be careful that disaster doesn't come from it," Huang Ande also said in a low voice. "We are all our own brothers here. But outside, you can't be sure..."
