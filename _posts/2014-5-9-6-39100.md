"The information I'm about to report is extremely important," Dongfang's expression became very serious. "You'd better have a recording on file."

"Alright." Wu Mu was a little surprised, but he still took out a recording pen from his drawer.

"What I have to say cannot be discussed over the phone, nor can the materials be seen by naturalized citizen clerks, so I've come to bother you. My apologies." Dongfang Ke spoke with exceptional gravity.

"Not at all. We serve the status of the Senate and the long-term peace and stability of Lingao. Please, speak."

"Okay, have you started recording? It's like this..."

In a completely emotionless tone, Dongfang Ke recounted his experiences from that morning, starting from oversleeping and almost missing rehearsal, to forcing his way through the queue into the stadium, and finally to his observations while hiding in a corner of the stands.

"So, you saw suspicious individuals during the art troupe's rehearsal?"

"Not suspicious, but definitely problematic. I said: a person about fifteen centimeters shorter than me didn't move an inch when I bumped into them. It's impossible that they are not a practitioner of traditional martial arts."

"A native spectator skilled in martial arts, and you said he had two women with him?"

"Yes, naturalized citizen women. At least they were wearing the clothes of naturalized citizens. Ah no, one is definitely a naturalized citizen, I've seen her. The other one I don't recognize."

"Are you sure?"

"I don't know. Oh, I have face blindness. But I know where she works."

"Alright, where?"

"She should be an amateur actress from some Grid Skirt Club. At least she was wearing the uniform of that idol group. Her dancing skills are abysmal..." Dongfang began to complain.

"We're not concerned with that—I mean. Are you sure she is a naturalized citizen arts enthusiast? Can you provide her name? Or should I have someone from the technical department create a sketch?" Wu Mu had already placed his hand on the handle of the internal telephone.

"How would I know? Those young girls all look more or less the same. Their skills are about the same too. Forget the sketch. I didn't get a clear look at her face, it's hard to remember. What I can tell you is that this woman is about 158 centimeters tall, her companion is about 162 centimeters, and both are very slender. The man is about 171 centimeters, his hair is neatly combed, he's wearing a long robe of high-quality silk, and he's holding a delicate ivory fan. And..."

"And what?" Wu Mu's interest was piqued.

"The woman I hadn't seen before and the suspicious man who practices martial arts entered the stadium together. After our rehearsal ended, the three of them went to some training hall together. I don't know when they left. It would have been too conspicuous for me to stay behind alone after the rehearsal, and it wasn't convenient to use the public phone there to call you. I originally wanted to have the garrison soldier Wang Qisuo go back to the barracks and bring troops, but then I thought it would be better to investigate first and cast a long line." —Dongfang Ke spoke extremely quickly but his content was clear and logical. Wu Mu couldn't help but marvel at this "soy-sauce" Elder who had never shown his true colors.

"Alright, so they didn't come to watch your rehearsal, but just happened to run into it?"

"Director Wu, do you think the point is whether they came to watch the rehearsal or to train?" Dongfang Ke's tone rose.

"Oh. You mean..."

"Obviously, that suspicious man has some skills. Although I didn't see his face clearly, it's clear that the female naturalized citizen was following him closely. Hehe." Dongfang grinned.

"Okay, I've noted it down. Could you please sign this recording transcript?"

"Yes, I can. I believe I have fulfilled my duty as a member of the Senate. If there's nothing else, I'll be going."

"Thank you for your timely report. You certainly understand the need for confidentiality regarding today's conversation. My apologies, it's not convenient to see you out. Please go back and rest."

"No need. Goodbye, Director Wu."

After Dongfang Ke left the office, Wu Mu picked up the phone: "I want to requisition all the surveillance reports for the stadium from yesterday. Yes, all of them."

He put down the phone, considered for a few minutes, then picked it up again and got through to the confidential office: "Send a stenographer over, immediately."

In the office of the Lingao Garrison Command, Li Yiyang looked suspiciously at his visitor: an Elder he had just met—the deputy director of the Art Troupe, Dongfang Ke.

This Elder Dongfang had urgently registered to see him ten minutes ago. Normally, as the highest garrison commander of Lingao, his time was very precious, especially with the cultural festival, which had suddenly increased the security pressure. Elders with no business with him had to make an appointment in advance. However, this Elder Dongfang had told the secretary that the matter was very serious, so Li Yiyang, out of caution, decided to see him.

Since the "Maid Revolution," Li Yiyang had been the commander of the Garrison Battalion. As the city of Lingao expanded, he became the commander of the Lingao Garrison Command. Although his rank was only a mere lieutenant colonel, he was the Elder officer closest to the core of power.

Remembering his grandfather's words, "the Party commands the gun" and "obey orders and follow commands," had allowed Li Yiyang, then a young man during the Maid Revolution, to avoid capsizing in the first line struggle. Consequently, although he was never promoted, the power he wielded grew day by day, from simply protecting Bairen City and maintaining local order in Lingao to now being responsible for the security of the Senate's access points.

If Li Yiyang's initial actions were merely based on remembering his grandfather's words, he now understood some of the mysteries of politics. Every time he thought about his decision back then, he secretly rejoiced that he hadn't made a fatal mistake. Otherwise, he would now be an inspector for the Agricultural Committee in either Vietnam or Taiwan.

This experience made him very cautious when dealing with every Elder. However, after hearing Dongfang Ke's request, he couldn't help but suspect that his visitor might have mental problems, especially with his long hair and flowing silk shirt, which deepened his suspicion.

"Comrade Dongfang, you're requesting to strengthen the security for the cultural festival. Do you have a specific reason?" he asked.

"Yes, but it's difficult for me to explain simply. I understand your forces are stretched thin. I don't need many people. Just assign two armed soldiers to follow Wang Qisuo, who's on loan as a musician, or just let Wang Qisuo himself carry a weapon to rehearsal."

"You must understand. Coming to me like this is inappropriate in itself—it's against procedure. The garrison deployment in Lingao is a top secret of the Senate. Even mobilizing a single squad requires an order from the General Office," Li Yiyang said. "Besides, weapon discipline is very strict. You're asking to have Wang Qisuo carry a firearm in plain clothes while on duty in a Class A situation. This is a very serious matter. I can't make this decision on my own. I have to report it to the Executive Committee for instructions."

A so-called Class A situation was one where multiple Elders were present, which had the highest level of security.

"Alright, please hurry. No matter who you ask for instructions, please do it as soon as possible. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave." Having been rebuffed, Dongfang Ke didn't say much more, stood up, and left.

Li Yiyang stood up speechlessly and watched the long-haired artsy man leave. He hesitated for a moment, then picked up the telephone: "Connect me to the Political Security Bureau, Director Wu!"

**Surveillance Division Q12 routine report to Liu Fuqing.**

**SECRET**

The subject left her dormitory at 0700 today. After breakfast at the canteen, she left the dormitory area. She followed the route of Jing 12 Branch 7 Road - Jing 12 Road, arrived at the Lingao Police Department bus stop, and boarded the 0740 No. 3 public horse-drawn carriage.

Following your instructions, our surveillance officer did not follow her onto the carriage. Based on her movements in the previous stage, we knew she would likely get off at the Stadium bus stop. Therefore, we had already deployed a surveillance team at that stop in advance.

To prevent her from getting off midway, we made temporary arrangements at all stops along the route.

The subject got off at the Stadium stop at 0803. As it was known that the subject has received special training, I decided not to send surveillance personnel into the rehearsal site at the stadium. The photography club of the College of Arts and Sciences was active in the venue that day, so I instructed Lin Aili to lead her photography club to monitor the subject. According to the surveillance report written by Lin Aili, the subject met with a man and a woman. Lin Aili took their photographs. One of the women has been identified as Lian Nishang, a Senior Associate of the National Police from the Dongmen Market Police Station. The man is currently being identified; based on his appearance, he is a native.

The subject watched the folk orchestra's rehearsal with them, and then participated in the rehearsal herself. A list of people she came into contact with during this period is attached.

Also attached is a floor plan drawn by Lin Aili, indicating the locations where the subject lingered in the venue. The subject left the stadium at 1830 through the emergency exit normally used by staff.

*Interesting,* Liu Fuqing thought. The surveillance on Li Yongxun's associates had not yielded any major breakthroughs, but today's discovery was truly unexpected: another police officer, and a native!

He had a vague premonition: there was a big story here.

Liu Fuqing opened the photo envelope in the file and took out the black and white photographs inside.

*The chiefs' new toy is amazing!* Liu Fuqing never showed the usual naturalized citizen's awe for the Elders, but in his heart, he always secretly admired their wisdom, feeling that he and everyone else were so insignificant before them. The saying "wisdom bordering on the demonic" was probably the most fitting description for the Elders. And this new camera was one of the products of their indescribable wisdom.

Liu Fuqing was a veteran clerk who had worked within the Ming system and knew the importance of identity confirmation. With photography, anyone who opposed the Great Song was doomed. These lifelike photos were not like the vague portraits where everyone looked alike and no one looked alike. Wherever the government's reach extended, once these photos were posted, no disguise could help you escape. Problems like forged travel permits and household registrations would be solved effortlessly.
