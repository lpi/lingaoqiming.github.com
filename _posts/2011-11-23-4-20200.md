The rolling mill had two cold-drawing seamless steel tube machines and two cold-rolling seamless steel tube machines. Of course, even without these machines brought from another timeline, it would not be a problem for Lingao's industrial level to self-produce a few cold-drawing seamless steel tube machines.

The rolling mill already had sufficient experience in manufacturing cold-drawn seamless steel tubes—all the gun barrels produced in Lingao so far were cold-drawn seamless tubes. With sufficient production experience, producing another specification of steel tubes was not a problem.

The new boiler still used riveting technology, and all materials were low-carbon steel. The equipment on a ship was not like that on land; if a problem occurred, the consequences would be much more serious. Early marine boiler explosions had never failed to cause major accidents—safety was paramount.

Sun Li and Zhou Bili, with their previous experience in building Lancashire boilers, consulted many materials, compared the advantages and disadvantages of various boilers, and, with the help of computer design and selection, finally designed and manufactured a "Zhurong II" fire-tube boiler. Its overall structural strength far surpassed that of the Lancashire boiler they had previously replicated.

The finally manufactured boiler easily reached the expected output pressure during the pilot run: an output pressure of 3.5 kg/cm², which was already twice that of the boilers used on the *Great Eastern* in the 1850s. The *Great Eastern* used the old-fashioned box-type boiler, with an output pressure of less than 1.8 kg/cm². To power its 4800-horsepower marine engine, it had to use six of these large box-type boilers.

The only thing that worried Sun Li was that the pressure gauge on this boiler had some problems. He was very worried that one day, an incorrect pressure reading would cause a tragedy.

With such a high-pressure boiler, not only could they save cabin space, but it also laid the foundation for the future development of triple-expansion and even quadruple-expansion steam engines.

According to the rated 500-horsepower steam engine output, only one such boiler was needed to meet the steam engine's demand. However, there were many other places on the ship that used steam. The excess steam could be used for cooking, providing distilled water for the crew... It was finally decided to install two of these boilers in the hull of the 854-modified.

The 854-modified project team still cautiously decided to start with the relatively simple 500-horsepower steam engine as the power source. Marine steam engines have special requirements for size and operation, so the various standard steam engines widely used in Lingao's industry could not be directly installed on ships. A dedicated marine steam engine had to be redeveloped. Zhan Wuya's opinion was that this steam engine should be a standardized piece of equipment. Without special requirements, it would be universally installed on all ships requiring 500 horsepower.

In the end, Sun Li and the others in charge of steam engine development decided to use the reciprocating inverted vertical steam engine, which was widely used and technologically mature in the mid-to-late 19th century. It occupied the smallest footprint in the hull, and if necessary, two engines could be installed in the ship, laying the foundation for the future use of twin propellers. The steam engine presided over by Sun Li was a more efficient compound-expansion type than the previous ones, which could be further improved to triple-expansion and quadruple-expansion in the future. The Manufacturing Directorate decided to start by replicating the compound-expansion type and gradually improve it.

In addition to the 500-horsepower main engine, two existing 12-horsepower small steam engines would be installed for auxiliary operations, including raising and lowering sails, driving the cannons, and launching and retrieving small boats.

With the power plan resolved, the biggest technical bottleneck of the 854-modified shipbuilding project no longer existed. The last major technical problem was the paint used for the hull. Although the bottom of the ship was sheathed in copper and no longer needed special bottom paint, the entire hull also needed paint for protection.

In this era, there was no modern paint. And all the plant-based oil substitutes, such as raw lacquer, soybean oil, and hemp oil, were in short supply. In the end, the ship's coating used asphalt paint extracted from coal tar. Asphalt paint has a strong anti-corrosion effect and was the most widely used marine coating in the European shipbuilding industry before the large-scale use of paint. This foul-smelling substance, when applied to the hull, gave the entire ship an unsightly light black color, so much so that the first batch of modernized ships produced in Lingao was called "black ships."

Of course, to truly build a ship, launch it, and put it into operation, it was not enough to just build the hull and install the engine. With every step forward in the 854-modified project, the Manufacturing Directorate and the Planning Commission would discover countless new problems that needed to be solved. Some required the Planning Commission to find new raw materials from various channels, some required the industrial departments to manufacture new equipment, and more problems were that they only had technical data but no truly knowledgeable professionals. Everything had to be explored, understood, and tested by the transmigrators themselves.

"...The construction of the 854-modified project has effectively promoted the配套化 (matching and integration) and systematization of the new industrial system, and has enhanced the overall coordination capabilities and awareness among the industrial departments. The industrial departments have established 2 new industrial departments for this project, built 297 sets of new equipment, including 46 sets of large-scale equipment, manufactured 2515 sets of process equipment and molds, and trained 3490 technical personnel and workers..." (Excerpt from *Contemporary Industrial History: Shipbuilding Industry Volume*, first edition, for internal circulation, no unauthorized quotation)

This stumbling progress was full of adventure, waste, frustration, disappointment, and surprise. So much so that Zhou Ke once said in a drunken slip of the tongue that, given the various difficulties he had experienced in the 854-modified project, the hasty launch of the 854 project in the first place was an unrealistic "Great Leap Forward."

Compared to the 854-modified project, the construction process of the six 500-ton sail-steam hybrid ships was much simpler. Basically, the technical achievements and experience gained in the construction of the 854-modified could be immediately applied to the construction of these ships. And many of the parts, tooling, and equipment manufactured for the 854-modified could also be directly used on these ships.

According to the "First Shipbuilding Preparation Plan," the construction of this batch of ships was designated as Project 901. After some design discussions, the final Project 901 plan was to copy the "90-day gunboat" of the North during the American Civil War. The lead ship, USS *Unadilla*, was started in late spring, launched in mid-August, and commissioned in late September, hence the name "90-day." The construction period of this type of warship was very short, which was greatly appreciated by the transmigrators who were in urgent need of new ships.

The final construction specifications for Project 901 were: waterline length 48 meters, beam 8.5 meters, maximum draft 2.9 meters, displacement 690 tons, deadweight 507 tons, with a two-masted Barquentine sail rig. It would be equipped with a 500-horsepower steam engine, a single propeller, and a 12-horsepower auxiliary steam engine. Its maximum speed was 10 knots, with a crew of 114. The Naval Department classified it as a fourth-class gunboat.

The role of this fourth-class gunboat was to undertake more route escort and long-range patrol missions, as well as cargo transport tasks. Its coal bunker area could be adjusted to flexibly change the coal or cargo capacity according to the mission.

The 500-horsepower tugboat was named Project 621. The tugboat was not only for towing barges. Since a large number of large-tonnage ships were under construction, the future docking and undocking of these ships in and out of the port could not be handled by the low-power steam-powered Daihatsu boats. High-power tugboats were needed to assist large ships in docking and leaving the pier.

Project 621 used twin paddle wheels for propulsion. Paddle wheel propulsion has the advantage of a shallow draft, making it suitable for activities along the coast and in harbors, and if necessary, it can also enter larger inland rivers. It is also not afraid of entanglement by fishing nets and aquatic plants common in coastal and inland waters. The maneuverability of twin paddle wheels is also relatively good, which is very much in line with the two roles the transmigrators have assigned to it.

While the shipbuilding projects were in full swing, at the request of the navy, the modification of the various steam launches already in service was also put on the agenda. They would be refitted in batches with ironwood bearings and newly manufactured cast iron propellers to improve the combat effectiveness of the small boats. The navy planned to transport some of the armed Daihatsu steam launches to Hong Kong and other places for various short-distance maritime tasks once the modifications were complete, to serve as the main force of the Hong Kong and Pearl River Delta detachments in coordination with the Type II two-masted patrol boats.

The endless stream of shipbuilding and ship repair tasks pouring into the shipyard forced Zhou Ke to request a 12-hour, two-shift work system at the shipyard. They had previously used an 8-hour, three-shift system, but the shortage of workers made it difficult for Zhou Ke to maintain such a labor system, so he requested an extension of working hours.

"Otherwise, a three-shift system is meaningless. With the current scale of shipbuilding, my workers are not even enough to maintain a two-shift system," Zhou Ke complained when he met with Wu De. "Not only do you have to approve my two-shift plan, but you also have to supplement the workers—even those without any training are fine. At least they can be used as laborers."

Wu De said, "If you make the workers work 12 hours continuously, can you ensure that there will be no problems in the long run? It would be a great loss if a few skilled workers died in industrial accidents."

"I heard that workers in the 19th century generally worked 12-14 hours. I don't think a 12-hour work system for a few months will have a great impact. We can strengthen the food supply. I want to apply for more food subsidies for the workers—especially the free allocation quota for protein, and also candy. We can also distribute energy supplements."

Wu De agreed to his request. Subsequently, he ordered that the shipyard have priority in selecting labor from the quarantine camp after they finished their "training." And the weekly "work-study" activities at Fangcao'di were mostly changed to "learning labor" at the shipyard and other industrial departments related to shipbuilding. Although these students might not understand the technology, they could at least write and calculate—this simplest of skills was also rare among the Lingao worker population.
