As if struck by lightning, all eyes in the room turned to the doorway, where a tall and imposing guest now stood. He was dressed like a fashionable gentleman from Europe, with an embroidered vest and a luxurious sash under a dark gray velvet pleated coat. He wore no stiff ruff; the silhouette of his dark coat was set off by a glittering sash that extended from his neckline, down past the frills of his shirt, all the way to the top of his stockings. A small section of a white silk glove peeked out from his pocket. In his right hand, he casually held a feathered hat, while his left hand, adorned with glittering rings, rested on the hilt of a gold and jade-inlaid sword. The guests whispered among themselves, discussing the newcomer's identity, history, attire, and all the related legends. Even the gaudy, ribbon-decorated insignia on his chest was rumored to be the Jewel of Pattani medal, a reward from Queen Ratu Ungu. In reality, it was just an ordinary cross issued by the Jesuits.

Weiss Rando squinted as he stepped into the hall. Hundreds of thick whale-fat candles bloomed like celestial flowers, and the light reflected off the whitewashed walls was momentarily dazzling. Manila, like most cities of this era, was ruled by darkness at night. Even in the best hotel he could find, the room was lit by nothing more than a dim, flickering coconut oil lamp. The torch baskets on the fortress and the torches along the main roads were but a few stars in the night sky.

Only now, in this brightly lit drawing room, did he feel as if he were back in Lin'gao, back in the civilized world, even on the stage of a metropolis. The show was about to begin, the lights were lit, the curtain was about to be drawn, and Count Vincenzo Rando di Fannanuova was about to make his formal entrance.

"The Count possesses the air of a conqueror. Dressed in his finery, he stood at the door, looking down upon the guests like the Emperor Trajan on his column. And when he stepped into the mayor's drawing room, it was as if Hernán Cortés had entered the palace of Montezuma II. Pretty-boy looks were foreign to the Count, yet he was surely a lover who could bewitch anyone. His body was as solid as a steel frame, with no softness in his silhouette. When he stood in the hall and gave a slight nod, the proudest bull in the ring would have felt ashamed. The profile of his head reminded one of the bust of Augustus on ancient Roman coins, every line so clear and distinct. His forehead was round, his chin charming, and his Adam's apple prominent, which particularly enhanced my impression of his valor and strength. The Count walked to the center of the hall, paid his respects to the mayor, and kissed his wife with great style. The gentle posture of his lips during the kiss, and his smiling eyes, added a touch of elegance to the Count's heroic air, making him a legendary hero in the eyes of men and a perfect, dashing gentleman in the hearts of women."

This lady of colonial high society recorded the Count of Fannanuova's debut in her diary with beautiful handwriting, then hid the diary in a secret compartment of her dressing table drawer, where it remained until it became a spoil of war for the Imperial army that conquered Manila, discovered by a member of the Planning and Development Council's special search team who was carefully opening the drawer, hoping to find something of value.

Just as eyes clouded by emotion often distort the truth, the former mercenary Weiss Rando was completely oblivious to how a certain lady, filled with affection, would describe his gentlemanly demeanor in her diary.

When he unceremoniously broke free from the overly enthusiastic embrace and kiss of Señora Isabella, the mayor's wife, he was nearly suffocated by the potent mixture of her greasy sweat and the perfume on her clothes. He had just escaped one cloying embrace only to find himself surrounded by a crowd of enthusiastic people and curious gazes.

"Sir, Mr. Count," the port tax collector, Don Basilio, pushed through the crowd to be the first to greet him. "What a grand event! Do you enjoy the bullfights here? Those brave matadors are all magnificent, don't you think?"

The Count glanced contemptuously at Don Basilio. This fellow was the first colonial official he had met in Manila. The fawning smile on his insidious, cunning face always reminded him of the detestable character of the same name in Rossini's opera.

"Mr. Basilio is absolutely right," he said in a half-mocking tone. "The weather here is extraordinary. As for bullfighting, I regret that all my experience as a soldier has been gained in fighting the enemies of Christianity. If His Grace the Archbishop, with his discerning eye, were to perceive that the bulls here possess a heretical or pagan faith, I think it would not be too late then to seek the counsel of the matadors on the art of bravely fighting savage bulls."

A ripple of soft laughter spread through the guests. The port tax collector had never been a popular figure, and everyone was pleased to see him rebuffed by the newly arrived guest of honor.

"Oh, my lord, Your Excellency the Count, pay him no mind," the hostess came to Weiss's rescue. "Mr. Basilio is very clever, especially when dealing with the Chinese. But it is precisely because he deals with the Chinese all day that he has forgotten how to speak like a cultured person." Amid envious glances, Señora Isabella took the Count's arm and began to complain, "To have twelve soldiers ride around on horseback in the ring, waving lances to stab a poor water buffalo, watching it slowly bleed to death... it's a terrible sight. I can't bear to watch." She took out her handkerchief and covered her eyes, as if in mourning for the unfortunate bull.

"The local water buffalo are not suitable for bullfighting," a dashing gentleman remarked. "A pity there are no Castilian bulls here!"

"In terms of size and agility, the water buffalo here are in no way inferior to any breed from the peninsula!" another gentleman immediately retorted.

While the two were engaged in a small dispute over which bull was best for fighting, Señora Isabella had already led her distinguished guest away from the argument. She tried to persuade him to take the seat of honor, but the Count firmly declined, choosing a seat by a window. The shutters were all open, and a cool night breeze blew through the windows, which were draped with jasmine and teak vines, into the stuffy hall. Weiss sighed inwardly. To maintain a noble demeanor in this sweltering heat, dressed in full regalia, was a chore. The temperature at night was nearly thirty degrees Celsius, and he was wearing a full woolen suit! But as far as he could see, all the guests at the banquet had gone all out to maintain their appearances. The men were all in crisp woolen formal wear with starched ruffs. The ladies hid themselves under hats adorned with peacock feathers or behind veils of various colors.

"Would you care for some oxtail stew, my dear Count?" It was the mayor himself who addressed Weiss. His appearance was the complete opposite of his wife's: white-haired and gaunt, as if the Manila heat had dried him out. "This is from the fine bull that was fought this afternoon."

"Thank you, Your Excellency. But I must be so bold as to inform you that, despite your gracious hospitality, I must leave before the city gates close. Otherwise, when the great bell strikes twenty-two, I will not be able to return to my lodgings. My request for a special pass has not been approved. As I understand it, His Majesty's decree does not permit unapproved foreigners to stay overnight within the city of Manila."

"Special passes and residence permits require the personal signature of the Governor-General. Of course, leaving the city will be no problem for you," the mayor said, looking somewhat embarrassed. "With an order from the commander of Fort Santiago, you can enter and exit the city gates at any time." The fort commander, a gray-bearded old colonel, merely nodded at Weiss in acknowledgment before burying his head in his plate and chewing with great concentration, his white beard soaking in the plate and splattering soup everywhere.

"If you would not find it beneath you, we could arrange a place for you to stay here. My wife and I are at your service, should Your Excellency the Count deign to command us."

"Your Excellency, I am most grateful for your kind offer," Weiss said, signaling a Tagalog servant to remove the untouched bowl of oxtail stew from before him. He picked up a glass of sherry. "But to impose on you would make me uneasy. I have already found lodging in the Parián (Note: The Parián was the Chinese quarter in Manila at the time, now Chinatown), and my luggage is stored there."

"Heavens, you are staying with the filthy, brutish, pagan Chinese! They are all wicked idolaters, smugglers, thieves, gamblers, and sodomites! They excel at petty theft and harboring criminals. I'm afraid you will never see your luggage again," a gentleman, who had perhaps been taken advantage of by a Chinese person, exclaimed dramatically.
