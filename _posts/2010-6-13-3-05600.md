"First, this year's sugar price," Third Master Zhu had already made his calculations. "We must push it down hard! As soon as their sugar firm opens its scales, we will set the price of each dan at one tael and five qian."

The crowd was stunned for a moment. This price was ridiculously low. In the best years, when the sugar price was low, one dan was still worth two taels of silver. In years with poor harvests, it could rise to over four taels. Third Master Zhu was starting at one tael and five qian, when one dan of coarse rice was selling for two taels outside! Wouldn't the cane farmers riot?

"This year's harvest is only average. The price, according to last year's precedent, is two taels and five qian. We've been buying at that price for over half a month. To drop it so much all of a sudden, we can't explain it. It's been a business for many years..." The one who objected was Feng Guangfeng, the owner of "Richangji." "Richangji" was a relatively small sugar firm, and this Feng Guangfeng was not from the Shantou-Guangzhou area. He had started as a shop assistant and only became the manager after marrying the owner's only daughter. He was looked down upon in the Haiyitang.

However, his words struck a chord with everyone. Business was about long-term cooperation, and both buyers and sellers needed to leave some room for maneuver. This move would create a rift with the cane farmers.

Seeing everyone hesitating, Third Master Zhu sneered, "It's fine! Everyone knows that the South China Sugar Factory produces a lot of sugar. We'll just say that because they are making so much sugar, it's not selling well elsewhere, so the price has dropped."

"Will that work?!"

"Why not? If the cane farmers are willing to sell at this price, we'll make a profit for nothing. Besides, we can't be blamed for the drop in sugar prices. Didn't the South China Sugar Factory cause it? Every grievance has its source..." Although Third Master Zhu's voice grew softer as he spoke, everyone understood. Some secretly applauded, while others broke out in a cold sweat.

"Brilliant!" the manager who had earlier suggested dumping corpses exclaimed. This way, they could deal them a heavy blow without completely tearing their relationship with the South China Factory, leaving a way out for reconciliation if needed.

"But there's a risk," the old man said. "He will surely open his scales at the current market price! The market in Guangzhou is good right now. He wouldn't lose money even if he raised the price to three taels per dan. Our price is low, his is high. Aren't we just handing over all the supply to him?" He had been worried about the South China Factory acquiring raw sugar since the beginning.

"No problem." Third Master Zhu was very confident. "In this prefecture of Leizhou with its three counties, even in a normal year, the sugar output is over two hundred thousand dan. The South China Factory's price is high, so all the sugar will naturally go to them. But think about it: even if he buys one-third of it! That's at least one hundred thousand taels of silver. Where is he going to find so much ready cash? Besides, the world is so chaotic now. Does he dare to transport such a large sum of silver to Leizhou? When he runs out of money and wants to stop buying sugar, it won't be that easy. Who else in Leizhou has a large amount of ready cash besides us? We can squeeze him with interest rates. Even if we can't crush him, we can make him lose so much that he'll be spitting blood!"

Everyone felt that this plan was feasible. The amount of goods that originally took twenty-one sugar firms to handle was now being thrown at a single factory. It would surely choke them to death.

"We shouldn't fear the one in ten thousand, but the ten thousand in one," the old manager was still worried. "What if he really dares to transport the silver? What if they already have the silver ready? It's a small matter if we don't receive any sugar this season; we'll just earn less for one year. But I'm afraid our reputation will be ruined..."

Hearing this, the other managers felt it made some sense and began to waver. Seeing the old man being indecisive, Third Master Zhu said coldly, "If you're going to do something, you can't be afraid of this and that! In my opinion, it's best to do nothing. Anyway, the South China Factory is buying, and we are also buying. We can always get some. If they want to ship the sugar out, let them."

There was a hint of giving up in his words. Some of the more astute ones knew that he probably had another move up his sleeve. They all said they were willing to comply. Only then did Third Master Zhu continue:

"Second, from today onwards, when you all talk to outsiders, you should occasionally throw in some digs at South China, understand? Don't say bad things openly, but imply it. For example, that big iron roller, and that chimney, those are things we've never seen before. As the saying goes, 'the abnormal is demonic'."

Everyone thought this move was quite insidious. However, because of their monopoly interests, although these people were legitimate merchants, they were not benevolent souls. They had done things like murder and arson before.

"Finally," Third Master Zhu said, "every year, each firm has a ninety-eight percent discount. This year, one percent of that two percent discount must be handed over to the Haiyitang. It's fine for me to work for everyone for free, but my subordinates need to be paid for their errands, and I need to spend money to inquire about things. The Haiyitang's public account only has four or five hundred taels, which is not enough."

The managers felt a pang of pain. This so-called ninety-eight percent discount rule was originally a handling fee when the cane farmers handed over their sugar to the sugar merchants for consignment. Later, although it was changed to cash purchase, the bad practice of the ninety-eight percent discount was retained. It was a large profit for each firm. Now, they had to give up one percent for nothing, and they were all a little unwilling.

Third Master Zhu said, "Don't look so glum. Once this is done, all the sugar factory's stock will be ours, and the sugar price will be smashed down to one tael and five qian. Isn't the profit in that huge? You're still staring at this little bit of operating money, you can't even do the math!"

And so the matter was settled. The managers of each firm first paid a sum of silver in advance to the Haiyitang's public account, based on the size of their firm, for Third Master Zhu's use. Because the matter was settled, everyone felt hungry and sat down to eat and drink.

Third Master Zhu didn't eat much. He said he had matters at home and left with his young servant. His house was only four or five shops away from here. The house and the firm were one, so he could handle business at the firm without going out. He didn't even have to go out on the street to visit guests; he could go directly to another sugar merchant's house through a side door, and so on, passing through each house.

This was also a matter of necessity. Although in recent years, through the "Haiyitang" organizing local militias and cultivating relationships with the government and various sea lords, there had been few attacks on Haian, small-scale robberies and kidnappings still occurred frequently. Therefore, the sugar merchants' residences were all connected by courtyard walls, with side doors connecting them. The streets and alleys were all equipped with fences, high walls, and deep courtyards, forming a closed community. Ordinary pirates and bandits had no way to get in.

In this way, Third Master Zhu passed through the back alleys of several sugar merchants' houses and returned to his own residence. After a brief wash, he called for his steward.

"Go, bring Zhao Jijiao to me," he said, closing his eyes to rest for a while. He had sent a capable assistant to inquire about the background of the South China Factory when the Qiwei Escort Agency was buying up land and sugar mills in the area. At that time, he just felt it was necessary to find out why an escort agency would buy these properties. He hadn't expected this casual move to be the right one! He was secretly pleased with himself. Otherwise, if he were to send someone now, Guangzhou was over a thousand li away. It would take more than ten days for a round trip by boat! The daylilies would have already wilted.

Before going to the guild hall, he actually already knew the basic background of the South China Factory. As he had expected, the Qiwei Escort Agency had another owner behind it. As for who this owner was, the assistant couldn't find out—the escorts were always tight-lipped, and the ordinary assistants didn't know. But he had managed to get some information about Lü Yizhong's letter through indirect inquiries. Lü Yizhong's letter had a clear price tag; as long as you could find someone to ask, you could get one for one or two hundred taels.

So, this owner was unlikely to be an official. From the fact that he had to buy Lü Yizhong's letter as a protective talisman, he probably didn't have much background in the government—though he was very rich.

With this basic information, Third Master Zhu had a good idea of what to do next. His performance just now was just an act for his colleagues, to pressure them to follow his plan.

"First glance, first glance, I suddenly saw a little maid like a fairy. Her eyebrows were lightly drawn, her innocent charm rare in the world. Seeing her autumn waves gently sending, exceptionally bright. I intend to plant a flower, just when the flower is fresh..."

As he was humming a little tune, the steward announced that Zhao Jijiao had arrived.

"Let him in."

A man in his thirties entered. He was dressed neatly and looked like a shop manager, but he couldn't stand still, his head and body constantly moving, his eyes darting around. It was clear at a glance that he was not an honest person. Zhao Jijiao was a local gangster leader. He usually hung out with a group of ruffians in the Zou Heshang Temple on Haian Street. The Haiyitang gave them some money and rice every month, partly to keep them from causing trouble, and partly so they could do dirty work when needed.

"Little Zhao, tomorrow, send all your men out onto the streets," Third Master Zhu spoke slowly. "Tell them to spread the word like this—" He then recounted the script he had prepared.

"Got it all down?"

"I've got it all down!" Zhao Jijiao nodded.

"Here's fifty taels of silver. Go and distribute it to them first!"

"Thank you, Master."

"Also, choose a few of your more presentable men and have them wait. The South China Sugar Factory will probably be hiring assistants in the next few days. I want them to be ready to go to work at the factory at any time. Tell them to work hard for a month or two. When it's over, I will reward them handsomely."

"Hiring assistants requires a shop guarantee," Zhao Jijiao said with some difficulty.

"No problem! I'll take care of the shop guarantee. You just get the men ready and make them look sharp!"

"Yes, but I'll still need some money for clothes and grooming..." Zhao Jijiao's eyes darted around, trying to get more money.

Third Master Zhu snorted. "I haven't even given you your reward yet. You can take it from this money first!"

Hearing that he had a reward coming, Zhao Jijiao's spirits lifted. "Leave it to me and my brothers," he said and left excitedly.

Watching Zhao Jijiao leave, Third Master Zhu still felt a little uneasy. He decided to send someone to Guangzhou again to investigate their background further.

"If they really have no background, I'll just get rid of them! That sugar factory is quite nice," a hint of greed appeared on Third Master Zhu's face.

The transmigrators at the South China Sugar Factory were busy preparing for the opening of their sugar firm. For ease of management, the sugar firm was located at Nanmentang, where the South China Sugar Factory was, essentially a branch of the factory. The main gate was right next to the official road from Xuwen to Haian Street. Mei Lin not only built a new counting house for the sugar firm but also organized the laborers to repair this section of the official road and rebuild several dilapidated bridges—improving the infrastructure was a consistent prerequisite for the transmigrators' industrial and commercial ventures. The common people were just curious about the road-building method of using oxen to drag large stone rollers back and forth on the road.

The plaque for the sugar firm was inscribed by the county magistrate. His calligraphy was relatively cheap; it only cost thirty taels of silver, a few bottles of good wine, and a few bolts of Western cloth and brocade for his wife. As soon as the counting house was completed, the golden plaque was hung up with much fanfare. The couplets on the pillars on both sides were inscribed by a well-known local gentry. These were all like protective talismans. The transmigrators were also following the local customs.

To facilitate communication with the locals and avoid language misunderstandings, Wen Tong hired a few local assistants to work at the counter and as weighers. He had been unable to find a sugar merchant's manager, and the Wen brothers were too young. In the end, he had to ask Liao Dahua for help. He said that anyone who had been a manager would do. Liao Dahua, not shying away from recommending his own relatives, recommended his cousin, Liao Daxing. This Liao Daxing had never been a manager, but he had worked as a senior assistant at the counter of a grain store in Haikang County for many years. He was good at dealing with people, and although his Mandarin was not very good, he spoke Cantonese well and understood the rules of business. Wen Tong knew that he couldn't rely on these people to run the sugar firm—they were all amateurs. He had to be there himself. Fortunately, the sugar factory was running normally, and with Chen Tianxiong in charge of the equipment, he could focus more on the sugar firm's business.

Liao Daxing, having just been promoted and hearing from his cousin that this owner was very wealthy and generous, worked very hard. Although the grain business was different from the sugar business, it also involved purchasing and transportation, and there were many similar rules. He handled all the affairs of the sugar firm, and Wen Tong found it much easier—after all, he was a technician and not very good at business.

After some market research, Wen Tong and Liao Daxing decided to buy at the current market price of two taels and five qian on Haian Street, without raising the price, so as not to provoke the local sugar merchants.

"Get rid of this ninety-eight percent discount rule," Wen Tong had a deep-seated hatred for such unwritten rules.

"Let's not for now," Chen Tianxiong advised. "Don't make it too special, it's not good."

"I have a plan. We can keep the ninety-eight percent discount rule," Chang Shide suddenly had an idea. "But we'll take it from the people and use it for the people. It will lay the foundation for Old Wen's future sugar cooperative."

"What plan?"

Chang Shide's plan was to use this two percent as a "common fund." This fund would be used to provide loans and subsidies to future members of the sugar cooperative.

"...Those who sell sugar to us will have to pay the two percent, but if they don't join us, they won't be able to enjoy the loans and subsidies. People hate to lose out. It will be much easier for you to promote the sugar cooperative then."

"Then do we have to explain it to the common people at the counter? Or should we hold a general meeting to explain it?"
