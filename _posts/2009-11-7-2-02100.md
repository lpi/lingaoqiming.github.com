After changing the road construction plan, the whole progress was much faster. [Wang Luobin][y003] also did what he said. The Executive Committee, through the personnel database, mobilized all the people who had experience in driving tractors, construction machinery, and heavy trucks. Bai Yu, a former tank soldier who was preparing to convert tractors into tanks and agricultural vehicles into infantry fighting vehicles to become the father of the armored forces of the Transmigration Army, was once again indiscriminately drafted and assigned to the engineering team.

Mei Wan personally went to the front line, inspecting the construction site and teaching these new road construction workers some tool usage methods and earthwork operations—it was pitiful to say that most of the urban otaku couldn't even hold the shovels in their hands properly. Asking them to shovel dirt, dig a ditch, or level the ground, none of them did a decent job.

He taught for a while and then looked at the construction situation of the machinery. Although the people who drove the construction machinery were not very skilled, they could still do it—fortunately, the Executive Committee had arranged for people to learn before the transmigration.

Fortunately, there was construction machinery. Mei Wan secretly rejoiced. Otherwise, it would be hard to imagine what kind of work this group of so-called construction team members would do. After a round of inspection, he suddenly saw a person who was working in a proper manner. He had been a project manager on construction sites for many years, and he could tell a novice from an expert at a glance. The young man looked strong and sturdy, but he was a bit lazy in his work and his movements were slow. Mei Wan walked over and said:

"You're doing a good job. Have you worked on a construction site before?"

"Yes, I've done a lot of work." The young man stopped to rest. "Are you Manager Mei?" Mei Wan used to be the project manager of the engineering team, so everyone followed suit and called him that.

"That's right, it's me. Do you know me?" Mei Wan was a little surprised. He didn't know this person.

"Getting to know the leaders as soon as possible is a basic skill for us migrant workers," the young man smiled. "When we see the leader coming, we have to work hard..."

Mei Wan laughed out loud. "What's your name?"

"Tan Ming. Everyone calls me Fei Ming." Tan Ming said and started working again. "I've not only worked on construction sites, but also as a security guard, an oil worker, a power-leveler for online games, and a printer..."

"How did a printer end up here?"

"I'm getting on in years and haven't made a name for myself. The economy is bad now, and I'm unemployed again. I thought since I can't make a name for myself anyway, I might as well try a different place."

Mei Wan walked around and returned to the tent. He was quite satisfied with the overall progress. The construction team leader, Bing Feng, came into the tent and reported to him that the food team had just delivered a 1-ton water tank of drinking water, and the salt had also been allocated.

"Still no safety helmets?" Mei Wan asked.

"Committee Member Wang said this morning that people have been sent to cut willow branches, and they are now being trial-produced."

"Good, it's not a big problem not to wear them now. There isn't much lifting work." He thought for a moment. "By the way, there's a guy named Tan Ming in the team. He's worked on construction sites before and is very skilled. You can arrange for him to be a team leader first and see what he's capable of. If he's good, we can train him to be a construction supervisor in the future."

"Okay, I'll arrange it right away." Bing Feng was about to go out when Mei Wan called him back. "You need to pay more attention to this kind of thing in the future and cultivate suitable people. You are a structural engineer and a deputy team leader. How can you always be a foreman on the construction site? Isn't that a waste?"

Bing Feng was a little confused and didn't understand what he meant. He mumbled a few words and went out.

Mei Wan lit a cigarette, his mind in a bit of a mess. Logically, his thoughts should be on this highway, but the scene from yesterday's meeting kept replaying in his mind. He didn't expect that Zhuo Tianmin, who had always been low-key, would pull such a move on him on the spot. This was a bid for the spotlight. Mei Wan thought a little bitterly: Zhuo Tianmin's architect and consultant qualification certificates would probably arouse great interest from the Executive Committee...

For a moment, he felt a sense of crisis. He had been very satisfied with the team of the construction engineering group. Bing Feng, the deputy team leader, was a structural engineer with a relatively specialized field; Xiao Yan was a jack-of-all-trades, but master of none; although [Li Xiaolü][y156] had a high level of professional skill, she was a woman and looked uninterested in everything.

But now it was different. Although he considered himself to have rich experience in the management and coordination of civil engineering, in terms of professional standards, he was obviously no match for this man.

As he was lost in thought, the walkie-talkie reported that the 3-kilometer roadbed work of the first section had been completed. Now the road surface paving team was about to enter the site, but the road surface material had not yet been determined. Mei Wan put a notebook in his pocket, picked up a small shovel, and went out of the tent. He continuously shoveled up a shovelful of soil along the road ditch where the soil was being taken, looked at it with his eyes, kneaded it with his hands, and then wrote something in his small notebook. He walked meter after meter like this, which made Yan Quezhi, who was measuring the hydrological data of the Wenlan River, very confused.

"Manager Mei, what are you looking for?"

"Looking at the soil quality." Mei Wan crushed the soil in his hand. "Looking for soil suitable for paving the road."

"Can't we use so much excavated soil? Isn't the roadbed filled like this?"

"The requirements for the soil used for the roadbed are simpler than for the road surface." Mei Wan explained that soil can be divided into clay, sand, and silt according to the particle size. The soil in nature is generally a mixture of the three. According to their different contents, they can be subdivided into nine types. They have different characteristics when used to build road surfaces. Some are very suitable, some are completely unusable, and some require modification treatment.

"A simple highway is a dirt road surface. Compared with the common hardened road surface, it has many shortcomings, such as large amount of dust, small road surface bearing capacity, and the road surface will soften on rainy days, forming puddles and mud..." he said. "So choosing and processing the road surface soil is a very important link. If it is used well, these problems will be smaller and fewer."

"For example, this sandy soil, there is a lot of sandy soil along the river here." As he spoke, he shoveled up a shovelful of soil. "The characteristic of this soil is that it is almost all sand particles, with little stickiness. It is loose and unformed when dry, and cannot be molded when wet. The road surface paved with this soil is prone to deep ruts when driving on a dry sunny day, and has a slight stickiness on rainy days. The advantage is that the road surface is easy to dry. It can only be used to pave the road surface after being mixed with a certain amount of clay for modification."

"What about this one?" Yan Quezhi was very interested in this question. Seeing that the soil over there was different, he quickly pinched a little and brought it over. "According to this, this kind of soil mixed with clay and sand is the most suitable for paving roads."

"Theoretically, that's true, but in reality, it's not that simple. Different proportions of various soils have different characteristics." Mei Wan said as he took the soil in his hand and looked at it, then rubbed it, and the soil turned into fine and short small soil strips. "The one you brought is fine sandy loam. It has both clay and a relatively large amount of fine sand, so it has some stickiness. This kind of soil is more suitable for building road surfaces."

"So we'll use this kind of soil?"

"I'm looking for sandy loam," Mei Wan clapped his hands. "It's similar to this, but the sand particles are coarser. If you use this soil to pave the road, it can maintain a certain degree of compactness after compaction, is not easy to loosen, has less dust when driving, does not stick to the wheels on rainy days, dries quickly after rain, and is easy to maintain a flat road surface."

"How can you tell? Can you see whether the sand is fine or coarse with your eyes?" Yan Quezhi looked at the soil in his hand for a long time.

"You can see it if you look carefully." Mei Wan continued to guide him. "A simple identification method is to rub it with your hands. Like the fine sandy loam you gave me, you can rub it into fine and short soil strips with your hands, but you can't do that with sandy loam."
	
"I see." Yan Quezhi was now completely in awe of him. "Professional enough!"

"Hehe," Mei Wan smiled triumphantly. "Not at all." He thought to himself that the old textbook was indeed very powerful.

It didn't take long for Mei Wan and Yan Quezhi to find a place to get sandy loam. Of course, if they couldn't find such an ideal material, Mei Wan could also do modification treatment according to the soil conditions, but that would require an extra process and the labor intensity would be much greater.

The paving of the road surface was personally directed by Mei Wan. Because the traffic volume of the simple highway was not large, it was not necessary to build a very thick road surface. A thickness of 15 cm and two to three passes of a road roller were basically enough. The middle of the road surface was slightly raised to facilitate drainage.

In order to improve the strength of the road surface, the engineering team mixed a part of the pebbles into the road surface soil. Because the suitable stones were limited, the effect could not be compared with a real gravel road. In other words, it was best for cars not to drive on rainy days.

"As soon as possible, as soon as possible, get this thing out as soon as possible." Mei Wan looked at the completed section of the road, threw the cigarette butt on the ground, and stomped on it fiercely.

Just after the first watch, the courtyard of the county yamen was very quiet. Only two yamen runners on duty carried small white paper lanterns and walked around the courtyard at intervals, beating the watch with a wooden clapper.

More than a dozen local braves were sitting or lying in the courtyard. If it were normal times, this official yamen would not tolerate such impudence from this group of bumpkins, but now that the city's defense was tight, and these dozen or so local braves had just fought with the sea pirates yesterday, the yamen runners turned a blind eye and did not disturb them.

The one who brought the local braves was Huang Shoutong, the head of Namei Village. He was in his fifties, with a burly figure, vigorous energy, a short, slightly gray beard, a broad forehead, and his eyes flashed like lightning when he opened and closed them. He was a large grain household in the county. His ancestors had followed the army at the beginning of the dynasty and settled in Lingao. Several of his ancestors had passed the imperial examination and changed their civil registration, and the clan had prospered since then. He was generous and righteous and had a high reputation in the village and clan.

Lingao had always been harassed by pirates, and the local area was not peaceful. Since the Jiajing reign, in order to defend against the wokou, his ancestors had built earthen forts and trained local braves in Namei Village. It was a famous "hard ground" in Lingao. In his generation, with Namei Village as the head, the six nearby villages were jointly guaranteed by the village compact. They could mobilize five or six hundred local braves at any time. Every time they sent troops to suppress bandits or defend the county town, Huang Shoutong would lead the local braves to participate, contributing a lot, and was highly praised by Wu Mingjin.

Huang Shoutong was a commoner, but he had a son who was a xiucai and was studying in the county school. This time, when the gentry were invited to a meeting, he was arranging defenses in various villages and only let his son in the county school attend. He also sent more than a dozen local braves with a cart of grain, rice, and vegetables to the city to assist in the defense. Now that this old man suddenly came to visit with his men, Wu Mingjin was both surprised and delighted. After the host and guest sat down in the flower hall and exchanged some pleasantries, Wu Mingjin saw that the old man's net scarf had been changed to white and his eyes were red. He was greatly surprised. He knew that Huang Dahuhu's parents had both passed away. Could it be that his old wife had also recently died of illness?

Seeing the magistrate's surprised face, Huang Shoutong told him that one of his sons had been killed in action yesterday while attacking the sea pirates.
