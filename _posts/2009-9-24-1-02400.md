The weather was not hot at all, and it was morning, yet Gao Ju was sweating.

Don't get me wrong. Although Master Gao was middle-aged and his figure had inevitably put on some weight, he was still a very robust man, not the kind of doughy rich man who needed supplements to handle his concubines.

He might not have been able to have a horse run on his arm, but he had once faced dozens of swords and muskets without changing his expression. Such a man was now breaking out in a cold sweat on a not-so-hot late spring afternoon.

A month ago, he had received a letter from Eunuch Yang, saying that he had already sent his adopted son, Yang Tianliang, to Guangzhou to discuss important matters with him. Gao Ju was really not sure what this important matter was, and his heart was pounding.

To have half of his profits stripped away by this eunuch for nothing made his heart ache every time, but over the years, it was also thanks to Eunuch Yang's protection that he had come through with some scares but no danger. Therefore, every year, for the interest and dividends, he would send every single penny to the capital or deposit it in a pawnshop in Guangzhou as he was instructed.

Every year, he sent lychees in the summer and delicacies in the winter, and he had not dared to neglect this grand eunuch for a single day. Why did he suddenly send a Little Eunuch Yang to discuss some important matter with him?

Important matter? Gao Ju smiled bitterly. He was just a merchant. What important matter could he discuss with such a grandee from the palace? It was nothing more than asking him to take out a large sum of money for "temporary use" or "repayment of favor." And the amount would be very large, otherwise it would just be a matter of a letter. To send an "adopted son" all the way here—it seemed Eunuch Yang was very anxious! He sighed. The windfall that had fallen from the sky a few months ago would have to be spat out again.

Losing some money was not what he feared most. Since the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old came to power in the Tianqi reign, matters in the palace had become even more unfathomable. His backer, Eunuch Yang, was a protégé of Gao Shiming. This Grand Eunuch Gao had wisely resigned in the first year of Tianqi to protect himself. Eunuch Yang was now a marginalized figure in the palace.

What if the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old took a dislike to Eunuch Yang? Gao Ju couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. He didn't like Eunuch Yang at all—but over the years, their relationship of mutual exploitation had tied them together—like two grasshoppers on the same rope. If Eunuch Yang was finished today, the agents of the Eastern Depot would come knocking on his door tomorrow, and the disaster of his family's ruin would be imminent.

This time, could it be about this matter? Gao Ju started sweating again and couldn't help but roar:

"Fan me!"

The maid serving in the study quickly began to wave the round fan by her side. A gentle breeze blew, mixed with a wisp of the fragrance of cosmetics and a woman's body. Normally, even the most restless mood would be calmed, but at this moment, it was no use. He only felt hot all over, and suddenly sat up straight from the couch, cursing:

"All of you, get out!"

The maids and pages in the room were all startled and quickly bowed their heads and retreated.

After enduring it for a moment, he heard someone report:

"Manager Yan is here."

"Let him in."

Manager Yan had come to report that Gao Qing had just sent word that the Australian sea merchants had arrived.

"They've arrived?" Gao Ju's eyes darted around. This was still some good news. It gave him some sense of euphoria. After all, seeing people who brought money was always pleasant. Recently, they had stopped asking for porcelain and were mostly asking for various precious medicinal herbs and spices, and also purchasing various hardwoods and sandalwood. This made Gao Ju very puzzled: the things were not difficult to buy, and there were plenty in Guangzhou—the problem was that nine out of ten of these goods were produced in the West (the West of Zheng He's voyages, not the later meaning). All foreign sea merchants transported them. Why did they insist on having him buy them on their behalf? This made him even more curious about the origins of this group of sea merchants.

This Gao Qing was also useless. He had served for more than two months and had not found out anything. But he hadn't expected this dull-witted man to be able to find out anything anyway.

For now, he couldn't be bothered with all this. He snorted and asked:

"How is the receiving of the goods? Are there any new goods?"

"Replying to master, there are no new goods. We are currently counting the numbers."

"Alright, invite them over for a talk."

"The Australian masters also brought a... um, a merchant with them," Manager Yan didn't know how to address the extra person this time, not knowing if he was a servant, an assistant, or a merchant of equal standing.

"Just invite them all."

"I understand," Manager Yan took a step forward and reported in a low voice, "The new person this time seems to be a martial artist. Should master?"

"Hmm." Gao Ju pondered for a moment and felt it was unnecessary, but Manager Yan's consideration was also out of loyalty to protect his master, so he instructed, "You pass the word, tell Instructor Zhao to bring a few guards to wait in the courtyard. Do not show yourselves."

"Yes, I understand." Seeing that he had no other instructions, Manager Yan was about to withdraw.

"Wait, has there been no news from the people sent to Shaozhou?"

"No. Little Eunuch Yang only left the capital on the second day of the third month. He probably hasn't even reached the territory of Nan'an Prefecture yet. He should be here in about ten more days."

"Tell the secretaries in the correspondence office to find all the letters to and from Eunuch Yang, open them up and read them again. Find out Little Eunuch Yang's background, how old he is, in what year he was adopted, what his hobbies are, find out everything for me."

"Yes, master."

"Have any new court gazettes arrived?"

"The secretaries in the correspondence office didn't say, so there probably aren't any. There was only one urgent selection report for the fourth month. It was all news of official appointments, so it wasn't presented..."

"What nonsense! Quickly send someone to fetch it!" This urgent selection report was different from the ordinary court gazette. It was a list of officials appointed by the Ministry of Personnel. Although there were no high-ranking officials, one could know the autumn by a falling leaf. The change in the positions of minor officials might also reveal some of the court's political direction.

After giving his instructions, he drank a few more sips of tea to calm himself down. Then he got up and went to the outer study to meet his guests.

It was Bei Wei's first time through the wormhole. At this moment, in the house of a Ming Dynasty person, it was as if he were in a dream.

It had been a long time since he was a reconnaissance soldier. After leaving the army, no matter what he did, he still tried hard to maintain the skills he had learned in the past. His participation in the transmigration trade this time was mainly to conduct a simple staff tour for the future underground activities in Guangzhou.

Master Gao was their collaborator, but he was still just a collaborator. Since it was a cooperation purely for profit, he could betray the transmigrators at any time. This was something they had to guard against.

If other forces intervened and, for their own purposes, were to harm Master Gao, causing their cooperation to be unsustainable, they also had to be prepared in advance to protect their collaborator and this channel.

From the moment he left the back door of the Guangzhou branch until he walked into the Gao residence, Bei Wei walked with a strange, stiff gait, each step a standard eighty centimeters. In his carry-on bag was a portable video camera, automatically filming the environment he passed through. But more reliable than this were his eyes and his brain: recording every gate, every courtyard he passed, where he turned, where there was a door...

The irrelevant servants in the residence had all been sent away by Manager Yan, but the strange behavior of this new Australian still made the few servants who were guiding and escorting them whisper among themselves. However, they were also envious of his strong physique—an ordinary servant would probably not last three moves against him.

The host and guests were currently exchanging pleasantries. To avoid unnecessary socializing, it had been decided before departure: Bei Wei was acting as a guard brought by the Australian sea merchants, so he just sat upright behind [Chief Wen][y002], his hands on his knees, motionless. But his eyes were surveying all directions.

Although it was called the outer study, it was actually a complete small courtyard, and this hall was not small. Bei Wei's eyes swept around, and he knew that there were a total of eleven Ming people in the hall: that Master Gao, a manager who led the way, a bodyguard, two serving maids, two pages, and another four servants in the four corners of the hall.

The four servants were well-proportioned, small but sturdy. It was obvious they were the Gao family's household guards. Their shirts were a bit too loose, probably concealing weapons like iron rulers.

This was only a part of it. From the moment he entered this courtyard, Bei Wei had discovered that behind the rockeries and trees in the courtyard, there were another four guards standing inconspicuously.

The real expert was probably the bodyguard standing behind Master Gao, controlling the door leading to the side room. He was dressed in a green arrow-sleeved robe, standing silently with his hands down, but there was a faint aura of sharpness about him.

He didn't know how powerful these Ming Dynasty martial arts masters really were. Bei Wei was itching for a fight. If he had the chance to fight them once, he would not miss it. He was very interested in traditional Chinese martial arts. The fighting skills he learned in the army were mainly modern combat, and he had not dabbled much in traditional martial arts. He had also observed some martial arts performances, but always felt that they were not satisfying: there was too much flowery and impractical stuff, and the real combat techniques were not shown.

Master Gao and [Wen Desi][y002] continued their business talk, both a little absent-minded. One was thinking about Eunuch Yang's affairs, the other was considering the expansion of the Guangzhou branch.

[Wen Desi][y002]'s main purpose in coming this time was to expand this Guangzhou branch.

The current foundation was already good, but it was still too closed. All their external communication was conducted through Gao Ju. This situation was not conducive to the future development of trade and intelligence work. One of the Executive Committee's ideas was to "go out" as much as possible and develop more agents—not just merchants like Master Gao, but also officials, scholars, and ordinary people.

Of course, this was not yet achievable. Their appearance was strange, and their speech was peculiar. If they went out, they would be surrounded by onlookers. But the family of servants that Gao Ju had given them provided them with another opportunity. As long as they could win the hearts of Gao Qing's family, the road ahead would become wider and wider.

The meeting ended quickly. The cargo lists of both sides were handed over, and the deal was considered done. The goods and silver would naturally be transported by someone, so they didn't have to worry about it. Master Gao was anxious to go to the study to read the materials compiled by the secretaries, and was not in the mood for pleasantries or to keep them for a meal, so he ordered a banquet to be sent over.
