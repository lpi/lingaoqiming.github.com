Wu De called a mass meeting. At the meeting, Fu Youdi and his cronies were fiercely criticized by the masses. All his problems were laid bare for public denunciation, even down to him picking his feet before meals and snoring in his sleep. Wu De encouraged widespread participation in this meeting to enhance their sense of ownership. This so-called "organized rebellion" fully satisfied their desire for liberation and also demonstrated his wisdom.

Fu Youdi was stripped of all his duties at the meeting and, along with his cronies, was sentenced to "labor reform under the supervision of the masses." However, when the crowd tried to physically assault him, and some even suggested he should be beheaded as a public example, Wu De stopped them. After all, Fu Youdi had served the穿越众 (Transmigrators) diligently. His end couldn't be too miserable, or else no one would be willing to pledge allegiance to them in the future.

Next, the problems of the other two team leaders were also exposed, including skimming from the food rations and slacking off. The two, feeling uneasy, consciously stood up, knelt before Wu De, and pleaded for forgiveness.

"Your problems are significant," Wu De said, putting on the face of a just official, "but your work performance in the past period has been evident to all, so these issues will not be pursued."

"Thank you, my lord, for your magnanimity," the two said, overcome with gratitude.

"Continue to work hard in the future," Wu De said. He then reorganized the entire captive labor team, renaming it the "Production Team." Lin Xing was appointed as the team leader, Wang Tian as the deputy team leader, and Zhang Xingjiao as the clerk. The team was still divided into four production squads, with the squad leaders chosen by election. Wu De stipulated that all management personnel must learn to speak Mandarin. As a result, the two previously criticized team leaders were able to return to their posts. Of course, they would be much more restrained in the future, and most of the others were also inspired to learn the language of the "chiefs."

The new labor system adopted a work-point system. Each person would earn 1 work point for completing the basic daily workload. Management personnel and skilled workers would have a basic workload equivalent to 1.2 work points. Overtime work would be rewarded with proportionally increased points. For particularly arduous, dangerous, or difficult work, the work points would be increased accordingly.

In front of a rough blackboard, with the simultaneous translation of Lin Xing and Xiong Buyou, Wu De finally managed to explain the meaning of work points.

"What are these work points for?" he said. "Work points can now be exchanged for extra food. It's like money. If you want to eat more fish, you use work points to buy it. The same goes for more rice." He paused for a moment. "In the future, you will be able to use these work points to buy more things, like farm tools and other tools. As long as you have enough work points, we can sell them to you..."

At this point, someone timidly raised his hand. It was Ma Peng. "Can I buy food and take it to my mother to eat?" he asked, perhaps afraid that Wu De would think he was trying to escape. "I can bring my mother here to eat..."

The crowd burst into laughter. "Has he gone mad? What use would the masters have for your old mother?"

"Of course, you can," Wu De seized the opportunity to announce his new policy. "This is the money you've earned. How you use it is your freedom. In the future, we will introduce more things that can be bought with work points."

People in the crowd began to whisper and exchange comments. They were clearly very interested in the idea of getting paid for their work. Someone then asked, "So the food we eat every day now, will we have to pay for it with work points in the future?"

"No, as I said before, it's for exchanging for *extra* food," Wu De explained. The food supply would still consist of two meals a day, one solid and one liquid.

"Master Wu said before that those who work well can become 'employees.' Do 'employees' also earn work points?"

"They do," Wu De explained the difference between the two. The work-point income of employees would be higher than theirs. For the same work, they would earn 1 work point, while an employee would earn 1.2 work points. Explaining what a decimal point was proved to be very difficult, causing Xiong Buyou a great deal of frustration. In the end, he used two fruits: one fruit represented 1.0, and the other was cut into 10 slices, with 2 slices representing 0.2. This visual teaching method finally made it clear.

Employees would enjoy three free meals a day (two solid, one liquid), be provided with housing, and could even be considered for some private plots of land in the future. These conditions made many people envious. However, the concern that becoming an employee meant becoming a "traitor" made most people not hold out much hope for this beautiful prospect.

Wu De knew their concerns, so he didn't say too much. Overly enthusiastic propaganda would have the opposite effect. Chinese peasants were the most realistic and also the most suspicious. Without tangible benefits, they would not easily board your "pirate ship."

Sure enough, everyone was skeptical about the work-point system, and some thought it was a scam. Paying captives to work? Where in the world could you find such a good deal? But from then on, Zhang Xingjiao was responsible for assigning work and recording points every day. After a week—they had already learned that the "chiefs" calculated days in units of seven-day weeks—everyone received a number of work-point coupons, ranging from seven to ten points. These coupons came in denominations of one point, one-tenth of a point, two-tenths of a point, and five-tenths of a point.

Given that the work-point coupons were essentially a form of currency, their issuance was evaluated by the economic professionals of the Planning Committee. After discussion, they concluded that there were no problems. The work-point coupons were essentially internal circulation vouchers backed by grain. They could only be exchanged for food in the Transmigrators' two canteens. The scope of issuance and use was very small. As long as the Transmigrators had enough grain, maintaining their basic credit was not a problem at all.

Moreover, the value of the work-point coupons themselves was negligible. One work point could be exchanged for a bowl of dry rice (100 grams of rice), a bowl of porridge required half a work point (50 grams of rice), and a salted fish cost two work points.

The work points earned each day could only improve their diet to a limited extent. The consumption of the Transmigrators' food reserves was minimal. Furthermore, as [Wu Nanhai][y009] said, "If after half a year of landing, we still don't have the agricultural capacity to feed the laborers, we might as well commit collective suicide. It would be more straightforward."

As a first attempt at issuing currency, and out of caution, the Planning Committee established a financial working group to make a series of regulations for the issuance, printing, circulation, and storage of the work-point coupons. The coupons were printed in the printing room using lithography on cardstock they had brought with them. The size was about that of a one-jiao RMB banknote; the one-tenth, two-tenths, and five-tenths denominations were the same size as the old one-fen RMB note. The patterns were printed directly in black ink without color overlay. The front featured the majestic image of the Executive Committee building, and the back showed the silhouette of the Fengcheng ship, with coconut trees as a decorative pattern. Only the denomination part used different colored inks for distinction. Each work-point coupon had a unique Arabic numeral serial number.

Xi Yazhou volunteered to inscribe "Transmigration Central Bank" on the new banknotes, but the head of the financial group, Cheng Dong, believed that this was just a crude token, similar to a canteen meal ticket. There was no bank at the moment. It was better to keep its nature as a token for now and not misuse the name of a bank to avoid any future complications.

In the end, the paper slips that reached Wu De's hands only had the simple words "Work Point Coupon" written on them, with the issuing unit being the "Bairen Production Team." Because the printing was very simple and the paper was not very suitable, the effect was somewhat similar to the crude ghost money sold outside cemeteries during the Qingming Festival. However, in terms of technical content, no one in the Ming Dynasty could imitate it.

There was a beautiful ink seal in clerical script on it, and a closer look revealed it to be his name seal. This left Wu De not knowing whether to laugh or cry. What was the meaning of this?

Cheng Dong said that this made it look more formal and gave the work-point coupons a more dignified appearance. It was equivalent to using Wu De as a credit guarantee—after all, the laborers didn't know any of the Executive Committee members.

"If there's nothing on it, wouldn't it just be a piece of colored paper, like the military scrip of the great Japanese Empire?"

After the work-point coupons were printed, they were all handed over to the financial group. Every week, Wu De would personally collect them based on the point records. Because creating a payroll was a detailed job that Wu De, with no accounting experience, couldn't handle, he only needed to bring the weekly point records. The financial group's personnel with experience in HR and payroll would then compile the payroll and issue the corresponding amount of work-point coupons.

For the laborers of the production team, this was a novelty. They all used copper coins; they could also see silver; they had heard of gold. Sometimes, when they had no money, they would trade their own vegetables, chickens, ducks, and coarse cloth for salt and other goods. This was the first time they had heard of buying things with paper slips.

The Ming Dynasty had once issued paper currency, but this currency, once vigorously promoted by the government, had long since died out due to the joint machinations of emperors and officials who had no financial knowledge. In such a remote place, the world had been one of copper coins and silver for many years. Although there were exchange vouchers similar to the later silver notes, ordinary people had no access to them.

After receiving the coupons, everyone looked at each other, no one believing that these things could be exchanged for food. They thought to themselves, if they rashly went to exchange them for food—Chief Wu said they could be used, but what if Chief Wu in the canteen said they couldn't? Even with the government, it was common for one office to say one thing and another to say the opposite. Although Chief Wu was a fair-skinned, kind-faced, and very amiable person, trying to buy things with a piece of colored paper might make him angry—when the gods fight, it's the common people who suffer.

Finally, at everyone's urging, and after receiving a guarantee that if Chief Wu were to hit him, Lin Xing would go and get Wu De to save him, Ma Peng took out a five-tenths point note and tremblingly handed it over to buy a bowl of porridge. As it turned out, the person serving the food took it without any fuss and gave him a bowl.

The people around saw Ma Peng get the porridge and watched him slurp it down. They then looked at the person serving the food, who showed no sign of coming to deal with Ma Peng. After a moment of stunned silence, everyone rushed forward, scrambling to pull out their work-point coupons to buy rice and salted fish. Hu Yicheng, who was from the food service department and was delivering the food, was caught off guard. He quickly sold out all the remaining food—no one had expected such a sudden buying frenzy, so not much extra food had been prepared. Those who didn't get to buy anything looked at him with longing eyes. The air was filled with the loud sounds of chewing, and their greedy gazes seemed to want to devour him as well. He quickly made a phone call to [Wu Nanhai][y009].
