With the heads of Dang Namen, his three chief lieutenants, and a number of minor leaders displayed at the county town gate, the bandit suppression campaign in Lin'gao was in full swing.

Bandit suppression is a combat operation that requires long-term commitment. Bandits, for the most part, have the advantage of timing and terrain, and sometimes even the support of the people, whether it's genuine "support" or coerced "support." Deploying large forces is both ineffective and too costly. From the very beginning, the General Staff decided to rely on small, elite, and resilient detachments that could both reconnoiter and fight, conducting reconnaissance while engaging the enemy. They would leverage the transmigrators' advantages in communication, mobility, and reconnaissance to offset the bandits' strengths.

To this end, special bandit suppression detachments were formed, each with no more than one hundred soldiers, including infantry, snipers, scouts, and engineers. Artillery was only attached temporarily for assaults on fortified positions. Each detachment was commanded by two or three transmigrator officers, usually selected from the Special Reconnaissance Team. Each detachment carried a 2-watt radio and several carrier pigeons to maintain contact. In addition to the standard Minie rifles, the bandit suppression detachments were also equipped with a large number of handheld shotguns and grenade launchers for fire support.

The soldiers for the detachments were drawn from various companies and rotated through the duty. The selected soldiers included both veterans and new recruits. Ma Qianzhu requested that, if possible, every soldier should participate in a bandit suppression detachment at least once.

Huang Xiong, as an experienced officer, was selected for the first batch of bandit suppression detachments. Five detachments were established at the same time, conducting clearing operations in adjacent areas.

The clearing operations were unpredictable. They had to set out as soon as they received orders, whether it was day or night. They often didn't even know their destination; only the "special reconnaissance soldiers" in their mottled green uniforms knew. Huang Xiong had been in Liaodong and knew that these so-called special reconnaissance soldiers were the Australians' version of "night scouts." They were clearly far superior to their Ming Dynasty counterparts, able to lead the troops to their destination accurately even in the pitch-dark of night, never getting lost.

Years later, Huang Xiong's memories of the bandit suppression campaigns rarely included pitched battles. Even assaults on fortified mountain strongholds or earthen walls were few and far between. Most of the fighting took place at dawn, dusk, and midnight. The detachments would launch surprise attacks on the sleeping bandits, and most of them would be killed before they even had time to react.

Sometimes, a battle would be fought by two or three detachments working together. Huang Xiong witnessed how the Australians, without relying on any clever stratagems, could coordinate complex multi-unit operations with ease, using only watches, maps, compasses, and radios.

The fighting was ruthless, and they showed no mercy even to fleeing enemies. Once they latched onto an opponent, the detachment would pursue them day and night. The detachment commander's tactic was to give the enemy no respite.

Huang Xiong never knew that a person could have such great potential, to be able to eat dry rations and drink water while on the move, to march through the mountains all night and go into battle at dawn.

Although the pursuing soldiers were on long marches and their physical exertion was immense, they were fed specially formulated "Grassland No. 9" high-calorie rations. The flour, fried in lard, was not only fortified with essential salt but also with fishmeal, dried fruit, sugar, and dried vegetables. Although the taste was not great, it provided the soldiers with over 4,500 calories per day, as well as ample protein and vitamins.

These compressed biscuits, packaged in paper boxes, could be eaten with water on the move or cooked into a more palatable paste during short rests. This allowed the soldiers to maintain sufficient stamina and health during the high-intensity mobile warfare of bandit suppression. In contrast, the bandits, who had difficulty obtaining food on the run and often had to flee again before they could cook what little they found, lived on a semi-starvation diet. After two or three days of pursuit, their bodies would collapse.

Even bandits who prided themselves on their familiarity with the roads could not escape such tenacious and cold-blooded pursuit. Whether it was the official army or the local militia, they would withdraw after a victory, losing their will to fight before they were even defeated. During the pursuits, Huang Xiong had more than once seen bandits, broken by hunger, fatigue, and terror, collapse on the road, allowing the pursuers to cut them down at will.

Huang Xiong never figured out how the "superiors" knew the bandits' lairs and campsites, or how they found the bandits' routes of movement at night. He simply followed the "superiors'" orders, leading his soldiers to fight the bandits in the forests, by the rivers, on the coast, in deserted graveyards, and in market towns and villages. They engaged in endless battles of encirclement, annihilation, rout, and pursuit, without mercy. The soldiers knew that if they fell into the hands of the bandits, they would be killed in the most brutal way. The soldiers grew up quickly in such battles. Those who survived became sufficiently resolute, brave, and ruthless.

The success of bandit suppression depended first and foremost on the accuracy of intelligence. The bandit suppression headquarters obtained intelligence through several channels simultaneously. First, there was the basic intelligence obtained in advance by the Social Work Department from village liaisons and the county government. Second, there was information provided by local militias and common people. After the first battle, which resulted in the annihilation of Dang Namen's gang and had a significant effect, the villages that were originally unenthusiastic about bandit suppression began to actively provide intelligence. Villages with militias even offered to provide guides for the bandit suppression detachments and send men to assist in the fighting. Finally, and most importantly, there were the "spies" sent out by the Intelligence Committee, who traveled from village to village disguised as small merchants and peddlers, gathering intelligence. The special reconnaissance soldiers in the bandit suppression detachments would also frequently detach from the main force to conduct field reconnaissance.

But this alone was not enough. The bandits were not stupid. They would also use harassment tactics, launching surprise attacks on villages to burn, kill, and plunder. This not only allowed them to make a haul but also kept the bandit suppression detachments constantly on the move. Therefore, the keynote set by the bandit suppression headquarters was: "Enter an area, clear an area, consolidate an area."

In addition to the Thirteen Villages work team led by Du Wen, the Executive Committee also organized several other similar work teams. As soon as a bandit suppression detachment had annihilated or driven out the active bandits in a district, a work team would immediately enter the area. The bandit suppression headquarters would select a centrally located village in the cleared area and station a work team there, equipped with a 2-watt radio and a number of guards. Intelligence and information gathered through various channels in the cleared area were uniformly reported by radio to the bandit suppression headquarters in Lin'gao. The headquarters would then analyze the information and dispatch troops based on the current location and mission status of each detachment. In this way, every new move by the bandits could be known to the bandit suppression headquarters in no more than six hours, and sometimes as little as half an hour. The troops' reaction speed was extremely fast.

In addition to restoring order as quickly as possible, the work teams also helped to establish self-defense organizations in the villages. Villages without earthen walls began to build simple ones. Those who couldn't afford to build earthen walls right away at least had to build a fence of bamboo and wood. They established a system of signals between the villages. If a village was attacked, they would light a fire at night and burn smoky fires and sound gongs during the day. The neighboring villages would then mobilize their able-bodied men to come to the rescue. The newly formed militias had no weapons, so the work team taught the locals to make bamboo spears, which they soaked in urine and then dried over a fire to make them strong and durable. In this time and space, Japanese peasants could use them to fight samurai, and the Ming peasants could also use them to deal with bandits.

The work team's guard detachment was responsible for drilling these temporarily formed militias every day, familiarizing them with their weapons and teaching them to advance and retreat to the sound of the gong and to form ranks.

Xin Nari felt like he was about to die. After he had narrowly escaped a surprise attack by a bandit suppression detachment thanks to a visit to his lover, he and a few of his surviving brothers immediately joined another bandit gang. With his glib tongue and his credentials as one of Dang Namen's four chief lieutenants, he actually managed to secure a leadership position.

However, being a leader was not easy these days. Under the constant attacks of the bandit suppression detachments, the gang was on the move almost every day. In the past, they could eat wherever they went. Villages without militias or earthen walls were like meat on a chopping block. They would enter a village, slaughter pigs and chickens, and after getting drunk and full, they could sleep with any woman they wanted. Even in villages with militias, when the great leader shouted at the gate, the village would at least have to provide them with a meal to send them on their way.

Now, such villages were becoming fewer and fewer. Villages with earthen walls would unceremoniously greet them with a volley of musket fire. Villages without earthen walls sent out sentries everywhere. As soon as they saw bandits, they would sound the gongs, and the able-bodied men from all the surrounding villages would come. Although these peasant bumpkins used to be scared out of their wits at the mere mention of the word "bandit," now that they had weapons in their hands and the "transmigrator thieves" to back them up, they fought with a fierce, albeit undisciplined, determination. Falling into their hands was even worse than falling into the hands of the bandit suppression teams—incidents of captives being dismembered were not uncommon.

They were on the run every day. Having lost the support of the local villagers, the bandit gang rarely managed to get food. Even lighting a fire to cook had become a luxury, as the smoke would often attract nearby peasants. The transmigrator thieves had offered a reward of one hundred "large catties" of grain for a single bandit head, and the armed peasants had turned hunting bandits into a way to make money. There had even been armed clashes between two villages over the ownership of heads and corpses.

The bandits' usual tactic of retreating into the mountains was no longer feasible. Bandits were not Sun Wukong, who could live on the wind and sleep in the open. They still needed food, clothing, and shelter. And the mountain strongholds that could provide all these things were the primary targets of the bandit suppression teams. Most of the mountain strongholds had already been breached by the suppression teams. Hiding in the mountains might be safe for a while, but in the long run, they would only starve to death.

With fewer and fewer men under him, the bandit chief became increasingly neurotic, losing his temper and beating people every day. As a result, there were constant conflicts within the gang. Yesterday, the oppressed bandits mutinied, killing the chief and all his trusted followers. They then pushed Xin Nari into the leader's seat, a "yellow robe" forced upon him.

If Zhao Kuangyin's reluctance was somewhat feigned, Xin Nari's was completely genuine. He had no desire to be the leader and was completely forced into it by the gang. He was different from the average bandit. He had long mingled with people from the government and knew that no matter who became emperor, when it came to suppressing bandits, the policy was always "the ringleader must be punished, but the followers will not be prosecuted." If he became the leader, he would become the "ringleader," and if he fell into the hands of the Australians, he would undoubtedly lose his head. He did not want his head to be displayed at the county town gate like Dang Namen's, to be pecked at by crows.

But with the whole gang coming forward, if he refused, he would probably be the first to die. Xin Nari took over the gang of more than forty men, not knowing what to do. The best plan for now was to leave, to flee Lin'gao for Danzhou or Chengmai—the Australians wouldn't cross the border to hunt them down, would they?

But the reason the bandit trade was called "local" was that it was crucial to operate in one's home territory. Once they left their native land, it was difficult to survive. And their counterparts in the new places would not necessarily welcome them. Even if someone was willing to take them in, he, as the leader, would most likely be eliminated.

While he was in a state of helpless panic, the spy he had sent back to the Thirteen Villages area returned with a report. He heard that all the bandits' families were fine. The Australians had only sent two "female officials" to Daolu Village, with no more than twenty men under them. His heart couldn't help but stir.

If he could launch a surprise attack now and capture those two women—he had long heard that women were rare among the Australians and had a high status, equal to men—he would have a bargaining chip with the Australians.

"What about Zhao Dachong?" he asked.

"He's fine, hiding in his house and not coming out," the spy added in a fawning tone. "Miss Xin is also fine, she's in Master Zhao's house every day..."

Before he could finish, he received a sharp slap across the face. The spy suddenly realized that the girl was a sore spot for the leader and quickly covered his face and fell silent.

"What about everyone else's families?" he asked about the families of the other bandits.

"They're all fine!" the spy quickly replied. "They're asking if you're safe now and when you can fight your way back. They don't even dare to wear mourning clothes now—they're afraid of being discovered by the Australians and taken away."

"The bald-haired thieves haven't made any moves?"

"No, they just run in circles at the entrance of the ancestral hall every day. There are also people wandering around outside talking to people. The two female officials don't even leave their gate."

"Hmm!" Xin Nari thought for a long time, then asked, "They didn't confiscate property, didn't demand grain and treasure from the families?"

"No!" the spy answered with certainty. "The work team just requisitioned some grain for their meals, and they use exchange coupons to buy things."

"Strange!" Xin Nari wondered what this work team was doing in the village. Whether it was the government or the heroes of the greenwood, the purpose of controlling a place was nothing more than money, grain, and people. If the Australians were after these things, they had never disobeyed their orders in the past when it came to levying grain and labor.

Truly inscrutable. At this thought, Xin Nari felt a little afraid. However, his current situation was desperate. After weighing his options, he decided that this move was a "desperate struggle for survival." He sent another man back to the village to contact Zhao Dachong and see if they could coordinate an attack from within and without. He had no confidence in succeeding with just his less than fifty men.
