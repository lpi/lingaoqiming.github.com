"Unusable?" A wave of disappointment washed over the room. The dream of a magnificent, multi-turreted ironclad battle-freighter, the centerpiece of their new world, had vanished in a puff of pragmatic smoke.

"Why run it aground?" someone protested. "Even if we can't crew it now, we might in the future. To use it once and then abandon it as a glorified hotel? What a waste! Without an invincible warship, how will we contend with the pirates of this era?"

"With a ship like that," another voice added, "Zheng Zhilong, the Dutch, the English... they would be nothing!"

"Can we avoid beaching it?" [Wen Desi][y002] asked. "There are good harbors in western Hainan. Lingao has several deep-water port development zones. Jinpai Port, I believe it's called. There should be deep-water berths there."

"It's not that simple," Meng De replied. He knew he had to educate them. In the 17th century, most ports were little more than sheltered anchorages. Large ships would anchor in deep water and use smaller boats to ferry cargo and passengers ashore. Modern port facilities—piers, jetties, dredged channels—simply did not exist.

The transmigrators planned to land in Lingao, on the northern coast of Hainan. The bays there were mostly undeveloped, suitable only for small fishing boats. "The Jinpai Port you mentioned, [Director Wen][y002], is actually Hongpai Port. Even after modern dredging, it can only accommodate a 5,000-ton cargo ship."

A murmur of surprise went through the room. The port they had chosen as their primary landing site was too shallow. "And the shoals," Meng De continued, "would make unloading a nightmare."

He explained that of all the ports in Lingao, only Houshui Bay had the natural depth to accommodate a large vessel. "But," he added, "Houshui Bay has no fresh water. In ancient times, it was an arid region. Without water, it is unsuitable as a base."

"Then what do you recommend?" The tone of the question had shifted from casual inquiry to respectful consultation.

"Where is the main base to be located?"

"Bairen Tan, on the lower reaches of the Wenlan River."

"Then Bopu Port is your closest option. It's the estuary of the Wenlan River. The central channel is deep enough, but the harbor is full of sandbars."

"Deep enough for a 10,000-ton ship?"

"The draft is the issue. A shallow-draft coastal freighter might just make it. But I have no hydrographic data for this era. Without a pilot and with a makeshift crew, docking would be a miracle. In modern ports, we use tugboats to push ships to the pier. With my level of skill, we'd be lucky not to run aground."

"So we spend tens of millions on a ship, only to turn it into a beached hotel?"

"My suggestion," Meng De said, "is to use barges." The idea was met with a collective groan of disappointment. He ignored them. In this room, on this topic, he was the only expert.

"Sea-going barges," he explained. "They have a shallow draft. A 1,500-ton barge draws only two meters of water." He laid out the specifications. They were slow, with a short range and poor seakeeping, but for the transmigrators' purposes, they were a viable option.

The main drawback was that they had no cargo handling equipment. Manually unloading thousands of tons of material, some of it weighing tens or even hundreds of tons, was impossible. General cargo ships, on the other hand, were equipped with derricks.

After much debate, they decided to prioritize a general cargo ship, with barges as a backup.

It was then that Wu De, a former maritime police officer and a core member of their future navy, spoke up.

"Even if we don't run it aground, using a cargo ship as a warship is impractical," he said, flicking a piece of dust from his sleeve. "It's too slow, too cumbersome. The enemy will not fight us head-on. They will harass our shipping lanes, raid our coasts. We will be stretched thin. We need sea control, not a single, fuel-guzzling behemoth."

The dream of the battle-freighter was dying a slow, painful death.

"I was a fisherman," Wu De continued. "I've operated fishing boats. A 200-400 ton trawler is seaworthy, with a long range. It's faster than a cargo ship, uses less fuel. It would be a far more effective naval force."

"And it can fish!" someone added.

"Yes, it can also fish. It would enrich our protein supply."

The idea took root. A fleet of smaller, more agile vessels offered a more practical solution to the problem of sea control. They would be the wolves of the sea, not a lumbering giant.

The plan was finalized. Wu De was tasked with selecting the fishing boat models and compiling a list of necessary spare parts. At Meng De's suggestion, a group of volunteers with an interest in navigation was selected for training. Meng De used his connections to place them on coastal freighters, where they would receive hands-on instruction in the art of seamanship. The dream of the battle-freighter was dead. In its place, a new, more pragmatic vision was taking shape: a fleet of armed trawlers, the humble beginnings of a new naval power.
