These hand-copied books were, in fact, considered legal publications, a sort of pocket edition—a necessity born from the Lingao printing press's lack of small-sized lead type. Some had found a loophole, creating these booklets and then feigning secrecy to prey on newcomers, desperate for certification and unfamiliar with local ways. A few shills were all it took to complete the illusion.

Legally, the bookstore sold legitimate publications at marked prices. Hand-copied books were naturally more expensive than printed ones, so the pricing was not an issue. No laws were broken. Furthermore, the act of buying exam questions was, in itself, an attempt to cheat—a grievance one could not openly air. Combined with the small sum involved, the duped were left with no recourse but to swallow their losses.

"I see..." Huang Zhen nodded, a new understanding dawning.

He quickly added, "Yes, yes, that is why I have come to seek your guidance, Director." He added, for good measure, "I will not forget this kindness."

"Oh, don't mention it, Director, you're too kind. We are all serving the Senate." The hostess bloomed with a smile. Not yet forty and from a comfortable background, her appearance was well-maintained. She still possessed a certain charm. "My name is You Xiu, you can just call me Xiu'er." As she spoke, she picked up a thermos to refill Huang Zhen's cup, leaning in close. Her perfume, a subtle floral scent, hung in the air between them.

Huang Zhen's heart skipped a beat. He was no novice; he understood her intentions perfectly. A martial artist's discipline warned against licentious entanglements, and adultery was an even greater taboo, especially given their current circumstances.

He suppressed the thought. In Ming territory, he would have adopted a stern face and said, "Sister-in-law You, please have some respect." But here, now, he could not. He could only play the fool, chuckling and taking another sip of tea, feigning cluelessness.

You Xiu, however, was not deterred. She spoke a few pleasantries, telling him to go back and tell everyone to "review well," and then suggested, "Why not get the B-level literacy certificate first? It will be useful." Huang Zhen grew anxious. Her words were official platitudes, offering no real guidance. He knew his righteous act had dampened her enthusiasm. It seemed that unless he offered some "benefit," she would not reveal any "shortcuts."

In the past, he, Huang Zhen, would never have stooped to this! But the rules in 髡 territory were different. His usual methods were useless. He had to take this last resort. The great cause was paramount. He quickly smiled again.

"Sister-in-law You is right, but as you know, those of us who can treat patients are no longer young. It is too much to ask them to take these exams. If you have any shortcuts, sister-in-law, please point them out. I would be most grateful..." As he spoke, he shifted his body slightly towards her. Still smiling, he said, "Come, let me toast you, Sister-in-law You." He stood, filled her teacup, and raised it.

You Xiu's smile grew sweeter. "A toast from Shopkeeper Huang, I must drink it." She took the cup, her fingers deliberately brushing against his as she grasped his hand.

"Shopkeeper Huang is a strong man," she murmured, her thumb tracing the calluses on his palm. "Such firm hands."

Huang Zhen could not pull his hand away. "A life of labor," he replied. "A humble background. I am making a fool of myself."

"Don't call me sister-in-law, it's too formal—besides, my late husband's surname wasn't You."

"Yes, yes." Huang Zhen steeled himself. "Please look after me, Sister You."

"Ah, that's more like it." You Xiu took a sip of tea with a smile. "Since you have shown me such favor, Shopkeeper Huang, and called me Sister You, I must look after my brother." With that, she took a book from the shelf.

The covers were the same as the syllabus he had bought: white paper with red characters. Huang Zhen's sharp eyes saw the shelf was filled with various "regulations"—"Compilations of Policies and Regulations and Their Instructions for Use."

She opened it to a page and smiled. "Shopkeeper Huang, you are too impatient. For the traditional Chinese physician's license, even naturalized citizens with B-level literacy certificates must study in a training class for half a year to a year to pass. The pharmacist license is easier. As long as you are a fully apprenticed pharmacy assistant, you can pass with some extra reading."

Huang Zhen knew this was the preamble. He adopted an expression of rapt attention.

The Director continued, "I heard you say that your doctor specializes in bone-setting?"

"Yes, this Doctor Jiao is a famous bone-setter in the north..."

"You see, in this case, he can apply for a 'Specialty Traditional Chinese Physician' license, not a regular one. This is also stipulated in the regulations."

The "Specialty Traditional Chinese Physician" was a special channel created by the Ministry of Health for unique talents in traditional Chinese medicine. The world of traditional medicine had many "one-trick ponies" who mastered a single technique, such as acupuncture, trauma care, massage, or bone-setting, or were particularly adept at treating specific ailments like skin diseases, snakebites, or venereal diseases.

These specialists were often from a long line of family tradition, their knowledge passed down from father to son, master to disciple. Their education was often limited, their methods based entirely on empiricism. It was impossible for them to pass the theoretical physician's exam. But to prohibit them from practicing would be a great waste. At Liu San's suggestion, a special channel was created: no theoretical exam, but a direct, on-site assessment. Those who passed were issued a "specialty license," restricted to their area of expertise.

For Jiao Gongli, this was the perfect solution. Of course, his pharmacy could only offer bone-setting services.

So there was a knack to it! Huang Zhen thought. No wonder they said "officials are as slippery as oil." Without this conversation, he would never have known.

His heart, which had been hanging in suspense, finally settled. Jiao Gongli might not be a scholar, but his skills were undeniable. He couldn't help but thank her profusely.

"What are you thanking me for? It's all thanks to the Senate's good policies." You Xiu's hand found Huang Zhen's again. "I see your hands have strong joints. You must be very powerful. Why not learn the art of 'daoyin' and 'tuina' massage? You could get a license for that too." As she spoke, she raised an eyebrow, her eyes dancing. Huang Zhen felt her leg press against his under the table. The warmth was unsettling for the usually upright Huang Zhen.

This Director You was so familiar with the 髡's ways. To lie low and establish himself, he would need her help. But this level of intimacy was dangerous. An idea formed. While talking, his hand moved under the table, and he took her hand, his grip firm and sudden.

You Xiu let out a small gasp, her eyes widening in surprise. But then, a slow, knowing smile spread across her face.

"You're a bold one, Shopkeeper Huang," she chided in a low voice, her eyes glinting with a new kind of interest.

Huang Zhen leaned closer. "I thought you might appreciate a more direct approach, sister." He squeezed her hand, intending to intimidate, to put her back in her place.

But You Xiu's breath hitched, and she leaned into him, her gaze turning molten. "Perhaps I do..." she whispered, her voice husky. "Perhaps... I like a man who isn't afraid to take what he wants."

Huang Zhen cursed inwardly. His gambit had backfired spectacularly. He hadn't expected Director You to have such... appetites. His show of force had only intrigued her further. Worse, her hand was soft in his, and he could feel the warmth of her leg pressing against his. A jolt went through him, a quickening of his pulse that he struggled to control.

Seeing You Xiu's dazed eyes, her body leaning towards his, one hand starting to move towards his chest, Huang Zhen knew the situation was spiraling out of his control. He had to pull back. He cleared his throat. "Sister You! This is your office!"

The words were like a bucket of cold water. Her head cleared. People were coming and going outside; someone could walk in at any moment. If they were seen, the scandal would be immense.

Thinking of her loss of composure, You Xiu's face turned beet red. She hung her head, speechless.

Huang Zhen thought, "That was close!" He quickly stood up. "Sister You, I'll take my leave..." He left without waiting for her reply.

Back on the street, he felt a wave of relief, cursing the degenerate atmosphere of the 髡 territory. No wonder the "fake 髡" women wore such shameless clothes!

But for some reason, a sliver of regret lingered. This You Xiu was truly a stunner...

Though it felt like a sacrifice of his dignity, his relationship with the Director had progressed. This would be beneficial for his future activities. He just had to be careful to maintain a certain "degree."

Back at the shop, he shared the news about the "Specialty Traditional Chinese Physician" license. A collective sigh of relief filled the room. Jiao Gongli was, of course, relieved. Song Shengying, who had been ready to give up, was now willing to try his hand at a 'daoyin' and 'tuina' license.
