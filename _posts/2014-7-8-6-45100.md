He was not a student of this school, so his unfamiliar face easily attracted attention. Before long, someone came over to chat with him.

At first, the local scholars merely showed the reserved politeness of learned men, a simple bow of their hands serving as a greeting. Then a portly scholar lazily asked, "Sir, where is your hometown?"

"Oh, I am from Lingao County, Qiongzhou Prefecture," Huang Binkun replied cautiously. Although his voice was low, it immediately piqued the interest of the entire room. In an instant, Huang Binkun was surrounded, his hands grabbed by three different people, while others put their arms around his shoulders. A sea of shining faces swam before his eyes.

"Brother Huang, are the Australian ships really made of iron?"

"Hey, little brother Huang, is it true the Australians can command the power of ghosts and spirits? Making their carts and ships move on their own?"

"Master Huang, how can one get into the business of selling Australian goods?"

"Mr. Huang, my family also sells foreign goods. Do you think you could put in a word with the chiefs for us?"

...

Huang Binkun was flustered by this sudden wave of enthusiasm. These scholars, right from the start, made him realize just how deep the influence of the Cropped-Hair Bandits was. He instantly understood that in their presence, not only could he not show his disgust for the bandits, but he had to act as if he had connections with the Australians.

As for which of these scholars still had the integrity of a true scholar, that was something Second Master Huang would have to slowly discover. For now, he forced a smile and bowed in all directions.

Though he was a scholar from a small county, he was still from a powerful local family and had seen all sorts of situations with his father since he was a child. He was not shy in social settings. After a flurry of "brothers" and "little brothers," he quickly blended in with the crowd.

In the midst of the hubbub, "Ahem!" a cough came from behind the onlookers.

"Such a racket! What sort of decorum is this? A disgrace to civility, a disgrace to civility!" At the sound of the voice, the crowd parted to form a path. Huang Binkun saw a scholar in his thirties. His attire was no different from that of an ordinary scholar, but his face was more refined, with a faint air of arrogance in his brows. He was clearly the scion of a prominent family.

"This is Young Master Liang Cunhou from the county school. He's the descendant of an official, and he also runs several businesses. His family is the wealthiest," the portly scholar whispered in Huang Binkun's ear. *So, this must be the leader among these scholars,* Huang Binkun thought to himself.

"Brother, you've come from Lingao?"

"Indeed."

"Good, good, good." This Young Master Liang said "good" three times. "Truly, seeing is better than hearing a hundred times!"

Huang Binkun was secretly puzzled. He was no famous figure, so what was this all about?

Young Master Liang then said, "Brothers, look, doesn't this Second Master Huang look like an Australian?"

A chorus of agreement immediately followed: "Brother Liang has a discerning eye!", "A perfect resemblance!", "Except for the unshaved head"...

Huang Binkun panicked, "I am not a Cropped-Hair... an Australian... I'm a genuine Lingao native."

Seeing his flustered expression, Young Master Liang couldn't help but smile. "Second Master Huang, don't be alarmed. It's just that your appearance and demeanor are truly no different from a real Cropped-Hair!"

Huang Binkun couldn't understand how he had suddenly become "no different from a real Cropped-Hair."

"Though you are not tall, you are strong and healthy," Young Master Liang said slowly. "And while your speech and behavior clearly mark you as coming from a gentry family, your skin is dark and your hands are rough. Looking at your expression, you are neither servile nor overbearing, and there is a heroic spirit in your eyes. There's also a faint, self-satisfied arrogance..."

"Brother Liang speaks brilliantly..."

"I feel it too!"

"Brother Huang must be deeply learned in Cropped-Hair studies..."

For a moment, Huang Binkun didn't know what to say, feeling a mixture of amusement and exasperation. How was he similar to the Cropped-Hair Bandits? Could it be that after five years under their rule, even his spirit had changed?

Seeing that Young Master Liang seemed to hold the Cropped-Hair Bandits in high "admiration," he naturally couldn't spoil their mood. He could only murmur a few humble words, saying he was "shallow in knowledge" and only knew "a little" about the "Australians."

"Even knowing a little is better than us, who are like men looking at flowers in a fog, or Lord Ye who professed to love dragons but feared them in reality," someone lamented.

"Indeed. When we talk about Australians, all we know is the Ziminlou..."

"That's seeing a leopard by one spot. The Ziminlou is merely for the Australians' sensual pleasures. How much do we know of their skills in craftsmanship and finance?"

...

Just then, a young scholar in rather fine clothes pushed his way through. "Sir, you have lived in Lingao for a long time, so you must know the Australians' ways like the back of your hand. The world is in turmoil today, and we are all looking for a new path to govern the country and bring peace to the people. We hope you will not be stingy with your teachings. You must be tired from your long journey. Please rest for a day. Tomorrow, at noon, I will host a banquet at my family's restaurant, the Yuyuanlou, to welcome you with all the brothers." With that, he bowed deeply.

Hearing there was a free banquet to enjoy, the crowd roared its approval.

The portly scholar introduced him as Young Master Lin Zunxiu. His family owned several restaurants in Guangzhou and had extensive property. He was known for his generosity and wide circle of friends.

While they were laughing and talking, someone outside was shouting something about "Cropped-Hair Bandits" and "killing people like flies," but it was indistinct. The portly scholar just dismissed them as some malcontent scholars who were dissatisfied with the Australians, not worth a thought.

Huang Binkun was keen to get to know these "loyalists," but it seemed that most of the scholars here were pro-Cropped-Hair, and he certainly couldn't afford to offend this Young Master Liang. He had to suppress his impatience and assess the situation first.

The next day, Huang Binkun arrived on time for the appointment. The banquet was held at a restaurant by the Pearl River: the Zhanxianglou. It was not only magnificently built, but a part of it also extended over the water, like a waterside pavilion. In the summer, one could drink with the breeze, the river flowing beneath the floorboards, feeling like an immortal.

From this restaurant, one could see the Haizhu Stone, so it was a popular spot for banquets every day. Huang Binkun had thought of coming here to look for opportunities, and although he hadn't been turned away by the waiters, getting close to the private rooms of the high officials and nobles was absolutely impossible.

He never thought that a single trip to the county school would make things go so smoothly!

A waiter led Huang Binkun to the main hall, where a group of scholars was already waiting. To his slight disappointment, Young Master Liang was not among them, but he figured that given his status, he would probably "arrive later."

"Young Master Huang's gracious presence truly brightens our humble abode. Come, come, please come in, please come in." Young Master Lin, from a merchant family, was adept at handling social situations. Huang Binkun bowed in return. After a chaotic exchange of pleasantries, everyone was laughing and cheerful, holding hands as they entered. A large pane of glass served as a screen wall right at the entrance. Looking at the windows, he saw they were all fitted with glass. In Guangzhou, this was a major expense, but for Huang Binkun, it was nothing to be shocked about. Not only were the streets of Lingao full of glass windows, but even the windows of his own home had been replaced with glass for over a year.

The waiter led them through a moon gate. On either side of the corridor were small rooms, each with a name like "Inviting Immortals" or "Joyful Roaming." Lin Zunxiu, holding Huang Binkun's hand, led everyone to the outermost room, the "Chrysanthemum Viewing Hall." This was the restaurant's most famous "water pavilion." Now, the windows on three sides were all open, with bamboo blinds of mottled bamboo hanging to block the sun, allowing only the river breeze to blow in, which was refreshingly cool.

Two large tables were already set in the hall, with cold dishes and fruit platters already prepared. Young Master Lin greeted everyone. The scholars, likely used to feasting on Young Master Lin's generosity, were not overly polite, calling out to each other as "brother" and taking their seats.

Lin Zunxiu invited Huang Binkun to the seat of honor and then introduced the scholars present. It turned out that most of these scholars were from minor wealthy families in Guangzhou; their families either had their own businesses or their fathers or brothers held minor official posts. For example, the enthusiastic portly scholar from yesterday, surnamed Shi, whose family made and sold bamboo and rattan furniture, was called "Chair Shi" by everyone.

After the first toast, Lin Zunxiu stood up, pointed at the layers of masts on the water, and turned to ask Huang Binkun, "Young Master Huang, is the scenery here worth seeing?"

"A great port of the south, it lives up to its name," Huang Binkun replied conventionally.

"How does it compare to Lingao?"

This put Huang Binkun in a difficult position. In terms of the city's scale and population, the Lingao County occupied by the Australians was far inferior to the Guangzhou Prefecture of the great Ming. But when it came to "civilization"—a word the Cropped-Hair Bandits often used—Guangzhou Prefecture was far behind.

"Each has its own strengths," Huang Binkun said. "It's hard to say which is better."

Scholar Shi laughed heartily. "Brother Huang, your words are a bit too slick..."

Huang Binkun was a little embarrassed. "I am also speaking the truth. The prosperity of Lingao is different from that of Guangzhou Prefecture..."

"How is it different?" Young Master Lin asked quickly.

How was it different? Huang Binkun thought, the biggest difference was that in Lingao, the whole environment made people feel comfortable. The ground was clean, the streets were neat, and the people also seemed orderly and energetic—there were no beggars and filthy laborers everywhere.

"Is Lingao exceptionally rich?" someone asked hurriedly.

"Not necessarily," Huang Binkun organized his thoughts. "In terms of prosperity, Lingao is far from matching Guangzhou. However, it fully deserves the four words 'live and work in peace and contentment'."

The crowd was somewhat disappointed, because in their eyes, Guangzhou city also deserved the description "live and work in peace and contentment."

"In what way 'live and work in peace and contentment'?" A voice came from the doorway. It was Young Master Liang, who had arrived.

He was the leader of this group of scholars, so another round of pleasantries was inevitable. Once seated, Liang Cunhou once again asked how Lingao was a place where people could "live and work in peace and contentment."

Huang Binkun gathered his thoughts and said, "As the saying goes: the old are cared for, the young are taught, the poor are provided for, those in difficulty are helped, and the widowed, orphaned, solitary, disabled, and sick are all supported."

These were all phrases from the *Book of Rites*, and everyone present had read them to death. Although they were words of the ancient sages, no one had ever taken them seriously.

"Isn't this the rule of a sage king?" someone asked doubtfully. "I suppose people also don't pick up things lost on the road, and don't lock their doors at night."

"Not quite that. But it's not far off," Huang Binkun said.

This drew more suspicious whispers. Young Master Liang, however, paid no mind and simply asked, "Is it really so?"
