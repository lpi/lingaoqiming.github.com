Where to choose to transmigrate? This was not just a location, but also concerned their starting base.

A good start is half the battle. The transmigrators, mostly being gamers, were well aware that a key to any strategy game is securing a good base location at the beginning. For them, this base had to satisfy several conditions:

1.  A good agricultural foundation to ensure food supply.
2.  A certain population base to meet the labor demands of future industrialization after transmigration.
3.  Rich natural resources to meet the needs of industrialization.
4.  Located in a coastal area with a port, as maritime trade was, after all, the easiest way to accumulate wealth in this era.
5.  Not in the core territory of the Ming Dynasty, otherwise it would inevitably attract a major suppression campaign from the Ming government.
6.  Not in a contested strategic location. The fledgling transmigrators could not cope with the likes of the Later Jin, Li Zicheng, or Zhang Xianzhong.
7.  Easy to defend, with natural barriers like mountains, rivers, or the sea.

Obviously, in the time and space they were going to, there were not many places that could meet such conditions.

To be cautious, this question was submitted to the discussion board for brainstorming.

The proposals put forward on the internet basically focused on three places: Taiwan, Hainan, and Australia.

Australia received a great deal of support but was the first to be rejected. Not to mention whether Australia itself was suitable as a base for the transmigrators, the practical reality was that it was simply impossible to get several hundred transmigrators to Australia. It was basically not feasible.

Taiwan was a hot topic of discussion. Whether from the perspective of geographical location, natural conditions, or development potential, it was an excellent choice. The island had no Ming government institutions. Although the Dutch and Spanish had built forts, they could only occupy their own corners, leaving it a vacuum. However, tropical diseases in Taiwan were severe, especially malaria, which to some extent hindered immigration. In the late Ming Dynasty, its development was still very low, and its population was even more sparse, making it impossible to carry out large-scale development without a labor base.

In comparison, Hainan was much more superior. Since its development from the Six Dynasties, by the late Ming Dynasty, it was already a southern prefecture with hundreds of thousands of registered households. In the tenth year of the Yongle reign, the Han Chinese population alone had 90,000 registered households and a population of 400,000, providing abundant human resources. In terms of agriculture, by the forty-third year of the Wanli reign, the island had 4.1 million mu of official and private fields.

What was even more valuable was that its natural resources were not only abundant but also relatively complete, making it very suitable for industrialization. The island has a total of 88 kinds of minerals (including subspecies), of which 67 have been proven to have industrial development value. Gold, rich iron ore, ilmenite, and zircon are its advantageous minerals.

The key to the pre-industrial era was coal and iron. Hainan Island has one of China's few large-scale rich iron ore deposits—the Shilu Iron Mine. The ore has an average iron content of 51%, with reserves of 400 million tons. It also has a variety of associated minerals. What is particularly valuable is that the Shilu Iron Mine is almost an open-pit mine. The topsoil can be stripped away for mining, without the need for a costly tunnel system.

In terms of coal, Hainan only has low-quality lignite. But across the Gulf of Tonkin is Vietnam's Quang Ninh Hong Gai coal mine. In this time-space, the open-pit reserves alone are 200 million tons, and there are billions of tons of high-quality anthracite underground. The coal mine is close to the coast, making sea transportation extremely convenient.

With coal and iron, steel can be produced on a large scale. With steel, the mechanization of various industries can be completed, and then industrial products can be mass-produced.

An ancient society might be able to create breathtaking works of art, but it cannot compete with the tide of mass-produced goods from an industrial society.

If Hainan Island had any shortcomings as a transmigration base, it was that it was too close to the mainland. The Ming government's rule in the local area was relatively strict. Except for the Li areas in the interior, most of the island was "under the king's civilization."

For such a prefecture that had been registered for many years, the Ming government would not easily give it up and would certainly spare no effort to suppress these ambitious outsiders—whether they were from New Borneo, Australia, or another time-space.

From the very beginning, the transmigrators would face the crusade of the local and Guangdong garrisons. They had to withstand it to gain a firm foothold.

Hainan also had a long-term conflict between the Li and Han people. Since the Yuan Dynasty, there had been a Li uprising on the island on average every three years. Less than thirty years before their transmigration in 1627, in the twenty-seventh year of the Wanli reign (1599), the Li people of Ding'an, led by Ma Shi, revolted. The Li people of Dan, Ya, and Lin responded, and the Ming government had to mobilize an army of 100,000 to suppress it. How to live in peace with the local Li people was another problem.

Finally, piracy was rampant in the history of Hainan. Many county towns in Hainan did not have a north gate. In the late Ming Dynasty, the South China Sea was an era where various Chinese and foreign sea merchants and pirates showed their prowess. Whether they were sea merchants or pirates, they would not miss an opportunity to plunder. Hainan, located on a major maritime route, had long suffered from it. It is conceivable that the transmigrators, with their countless modern tools and supplies, would be a fat sheep coveted by all sides.

In this light, although Hainan had a better foundation than Taiwan, it would also face much greater pressure.

"In that case, let's choose Taiwan," someone suggested in the online meeting after listening to the Executive Committee's introduction to the situation in Hainan. "Taiwan has malaria, but we can bring quinine, and we can also plant cinchona trees in Taiwan. As for the population, there were so many refugees in the late Ming Dynasty. Using food and land as bait, it wouldn't be a problem to transport a few hundred thousand people over."

"Transporting a few hundred thousand people, you say it so lightly. What will you use to transport them?" someone immediately questioned.

"Ships, of course. We can transmigrate with a ten-thousand-ton ship, with all the materials and people on board. It would be a maritime hegemon. We wouldn't even need cannons. If we don't like someone, we just ram them."

"Are you planning to burn alcohol or charcoal for it?"

"We can build our own ships. Taiwan has plenty of high-quality timber."

"Fine, then tell me, where do the sailors come from?"

"We can train our own sailors. We can recruit foreign sailors in Macau to be instructors."

"What a joke. Were Koxinga's ships all sailed by foreigners? I can't stand you people who worship everything foreign."

"Can cinchona trees even grow in Taiwan?"

"If you say that, then rubber trees shouldn't be able to grow on the Leizhou Peninsula, but they did."

"I'm talking about Taiwan. Are the Leizhou Peninsula and Taiwan on the same latitude?!"

...

When the topic began to drift to whether the treasure ships were wooden ten-thousand-ton vessels, whether artemisinin could prevent and treat malaria, and then to whether Traditional Chinese Medicine was a pseudoscience, [Wen Desi][y002] quickly put a stop to everyone's enthusiasm. [Xiao Zishan][y001] asked to speak.

"I think Hainan is more suitable," [Xiao Zishan][y001] had been silent until now. He supported the Hainan plan in his heart, but was not in a hurry to state his position. After everyone had clarified the pros and cons in the debate, he had also sorted out the various issues in his mind, and the focus of his speech naturally emerged.

"Why is Hainan more suitable than Taiwan? Let's compare it with the requirements we proposed for the base. On several key issues, Taiwan is far inferior to Hainan.

"First is the agricultural foundation. The real development of agriculture in Taiwan basically began when Koxinga recovered Taiwan and used it as a base to fight the Qing and restore the Ming—that was around the mid-to-late 17th century. The year we have chosen is 1628. At this time, it can hardly be said to have any agriculture, only a small amount of land reclaimed by some coastal immigrant villages. Hainan has at least 3.8 million mu of cultivated land and dozens of water conservancy projects built over the dynasties. Note that this acreage is only what is on the books; land concealment in the Ming Dynasty was quite common.

"In terms of population, there were very few Han immigrants in Taiwan in 1628. The large-scale industrial and agricultural construction we will carry out after transmigration will require a large population as a labor force. Taiwan's population cannot meet the needs, so we would have to import immigrants from the very beginning. Recruiting refugees, organizing them to bring their families across prefectures and counties to the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang before they can be shipped. This is a complex and arduous task, involving the allocation of manpower and material resources, dealing with the various levels of Ming officials... Who among us has such experience and ability?

"Even if we could transport enough of the floating population to the island, the follow-up work would be very difficult. The refugees are basically destitute. We would need to prevent epidemics, provide relief, resettle them, arrange housing, seeds, farm tools... Where would all these things come from? With our early strength, we would be unable to do such a big thing. In comparison, Hainan has a population base of at least 400,000. This number is enough to meet the needs of early development."

The previous discussion had exhausted most people's enthusiasm, and some people's irrational remarks had also caused disgust. At this moment, [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s well-reasoned and well-spoken speech won the approval of the majority. Hainan, the future base, was confirmed by a vote.

In this time and space of the late Ming, Hainan was established as Qiongzhou Prefecture, governing three prefectures and ten counties: Qiongshan, Chengmai, Lingao, Ding'an, Wenchang, Lehui, Huitong, Changhua, Lingshui, and Gan'en ten counties; and Danzhou, Wanzhou, and Yazhou three prefectures.

If you take a look at the Yuan-Ming volume of the Historical Atlas of China, you will find that the prefectures and counties of Hainan are arranged in a complete circle along the coast of the island. Historically, Hainan Island was once in a state of Li in the south and Han in the north, but after the Song Dynasty, it became Han on the outside and Li on the inside.

Among these prefectures and counties, the three counties of Qiongshan, Chengmai, and Lingao have the longest history of development. They are the main Han Chinese gathering areas and agricultural areas on the island, and half of the Han Chinese population is concentrated here.

Of these three places, Qiongshan County, which is where the Qiongzhou Prefecture government is located, has the best basic environment: in the late Ming Dynasty, the island had 3.83 million mu of registered official and private fields, and this county accounted for nearly a quarter of it, with a registered tax-paying population of nearly 90,000.

But at the same time, this was also the political and economic center of the Ming Dynasty on the island, with a large number of troops stationed there at all times. It also had political symbolic significance. The fall of a frontier prefectural city like Qiongzhou would be a huge shock to the Ming court, and it goes without saying that it would attract a large-scale military suppression.

Although Chengmai was also good, it was adjacent to Qiongshan County, which was a bit too close to the center of Ming rule in Hainan.

Lingao thus became the best choice.

In this time-space, Lingao is an obscure small county in Hainan, far less famous than Haikou or Sanya. Its economy is backward, and tourism is almost non-existent. Unless you are a hiker who loves in-depth travel, most people do not know that there is such a place in Hainan. If you search for the word Lingao on the internet with a search engine, most of the entries are a sentence from the PLA's cross-sea liberation of Hainan sixty years ago: The PLA first landed at Lingao Cape. That's right, this Lingao Cape is in Lingao County, less than twelve kilometers from the county town.

Although Lingao is obscure, it is a thousand-year-old ancient county. Its establishment as a county can be traced back to the fifth year of the Wude reign of the Tang Dynasty. It is one of the earliest areas where Han Chinese immigrants from the mainland settled, and has a long history of development. Although Lingao was not as populous as Qiongshan, it still had a registered population of 25,000 in the forty-fifth year of the Wanli reign. The alluvial plain on both sides of the Wenlan River was developed early, forming a certain agricultural foundation. If it could be supplemented with certain water conservancy facilities for development, its agricultural potential would be great. In this plane, Lingao is the land of fish and rice in Hainan.

Finally, it is separated from Qiongzhou Prefecture by Chengmai. Any trouble would not immediately face the direct pressure of the Ming government. Given the communication conditions and work efficiency of ancient dynasties, matters that crossed prefectures and counties would take at least a month to handle, and for a place like Hainan, it would probably take even longer.

After this topic, some people successively raised other questions, but there was no longer any objection to Lingao as the base at the beginning of the transmigration. In [Wen Desi][y002]'s concluding remarks of the meeting: everyone unanimously agreed that this meeting was a "successful congress, a congress of unity, a congress of victory." In the history textbooks of the new world in the future, the congress was called the "First Transmigrator Congress." Because there were too many representatives, and many people ultimately chose to stay in the old world, the full list of names can only be consulted in the "Old World Cathedral"—theoretically, it is not to be consulted.
