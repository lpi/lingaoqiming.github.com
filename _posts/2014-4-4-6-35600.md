His gaze settled on the innkeeper's face, a smile playing on his lips. "Innkeeper, you have a silver tongue. Your establishment is truly the finest in Lingao."

The innkeeper chuckled. "You flatter me, sir. May I be so bold as to ask your esteemed name?"

"My surname is Zhuo. Yifan."

"An honor, Master Zhuo. Please, follow me. You may call me Li Xiaoliu."

"Not at all. Thank you for your trouble," Zhuo Yifan replied with practiced politeness.

As they spoke, the rest of his party disembarked. Several finely dressed women, surrounded by a retinue of maids and servants, emerged from the carriages, attended by male servants and guards—the very picture of a wealthy and powerful family on the move.

The innkeeper, well-versed in the ways of the gentry, knew that such families guarded their womenfolk from prying eyes. For this reason, General Manager Li had even hired female attendants. He kept his gaze averted, focusing instead on welcoming Zhuo Yifan and his party.

Just as they reached the entrance, a sharp cry erupted from within. A figure was flung from the doorway, landing with a heavy thud on the ground. He rolled several times before coming to a dusty stop.

It was a large man in black, now groaning and struggling to rise.

A shadow fell across the doorway. A woman, curvaceous and beautiful, appeared. She had picturesque features, cherry-red lips, and a shock of short, black hair. She wore a black police uniform, a diagonal leather belt cinching her slender waist.

She strode out, one eyebrow arched, and pointed a finger at the man. "Do you think this is the Great Ming? Still trying to throw your weight around like some pampered dog? Let me tell you, I'm in a good mood today. Otherwise, for that little grab of yours, I'd charge you with assaulting an officer and put a bullet through your skull!"

The man on the ground pushed himself up, his face a mask of defiance.

The woman snorted. "I came to register your master's household as a favor to General Manager Li. Since you dared to be insolent, to spout nonsense, and to try and take advantage of a public servant of the Senate, don't blame me for doing things by the book. Tell your master to bring his entire family to the police station tomorrow. I don't care if it's his first wife, his concubine, his unmarried daughter, or his newlywed daughter-in-law. They'll all stand on the street and wait to be called! And don't blame me if you miss the deadline—you earned this for your master."

The burly man's eyes rolled back in his head. He didn't dare utter another word.

The policewoman dusted off her hands. Servants and the inn's manager rushed out. A man who looked like a steward was already there, holding a red envelope, which he quickly tried to press into the policewoman's hand, his smile obsequious. "Officer, please calm down. He was blind and foolish to have offended you..."

But she was not swayed. With a sneer, she slapped the red envelope aside and walked away. Even the manager, who had intended to mediate, shrank back.

The steward, his face flushed with anger, snatched the red envelope from the ground and stomped his feet, cursing the unfortunate man. The burly man, his face pale, said nothing and scurried back inside after the steward, like a rat seeking its hole.

The crowd on the street pointed and whispered. Zhuo Yifan was taken aback. He had never seen such a simple, brutally effective fighting style. It was devoid of flourish, utterly practical.

He whispered to the innkeeper, "Who is she?"

"A police officer from the East Gate Market station. She's in charge of security in this area."

"A police officer? A public servant?"

"Yes, that's the term here. They handle hotel registration, household registration, and issuing identification cards."

"In that case, how could that man be so bold? As they say, a strong dragon doesn't provoke the local snake, especially not a public servant!"

"You're right, sir. But where else do you see women as public servants? The man is a newcomer, ignorant of our ways. He's a servant of Master Guo, who arrived yesterday. He knows a few clumsy moves and often escorts Master Guo's third concubine. Old Master Guo was an official in the capital. A word from his family, and any local official would bow. The servant is used to arrogance. He'd also had a few drinks. The alcohol went to his head, and he made a great deal of trouble for his master."

Though the innkeeper lowered his voice, a hint of schadenfreude colored his tone. It seemed this family was not well-liked.

"This policewoman's skills are truly impressive..."

"You carry a sword, sir. I imagine you are a martial artist yourself."

"A zither, a sword, and a box of books are a scholar's essentials. I can brandish it for exercise, but I wouldn't call it martial arts."

The innkeeper chuckled and led him inside.

The Qiong'an Inn's service to these "gods of wealth" was meticulous. They maintained offices in several ports with regular shipping lines, such as Haikou and Bopu, complete with lounges and carriage fleets. After disembarking, the wealthy families could rest before taking a carriage to East Gate Market.

Because the women of such families were generally unwilling to show their faces in public, it was difficult to make them adapt to Lingao's "queuing and numbering" system. Li Xiaopeng had asked his grandfather to speak with Chief Xiong, and they were granted the "privilege" of having the police come to them to register their households.

Even the design of the main gate was unique. A screen wall greeted visitors upon entry. Beyond it lay a front courtyard with a reception desk and three entrances. The left and right entrances led to long alleys flanked by courtyards of various sizes. The central entrance led to the back courtyard, housing the kitchen, stables, and storage. A private garden had been built next to the inn for the ladies to relax.

The attendants led the group into the left alley. High brick walls cast cool shadows, and narrow flower stands adorned with green potted plants added a touch of life.

The alley was lined with black-lacquered courtyard doors, each with a plaque. The attendant led Zhuo Yifan to one, produced a key, and opened a lock built into the door itself, a novel mechanism.

The inn had prepared two courtyards for them, a large one for the servants and a smaller one for the masters. Though they had the layout of a traditional siheyuan, the structure was entirely different. Multi-story buildings maximized floor space, and the layout was designed with the complex social dynamics of large families in mind, separating men and women, relatives and strangers, masters and servants. No other inn in Lingao could offer such accommodations. Naturally, few could afford it, but the guests who stayed, from a few days to over half a year, ensured a steady stream of business.

Zhuo Yifan and the steward took a quick look and were very satisfied. The rooms were clean, the furnishings elegant. The legendary "Australian comforts" were, of course, beyond mention.

They settled in, with Zhuo Yifan, as the "young master," overseeing everything. Wealthy families traveled with not only their own bedding but also their own spittoons, tea cups, and candlesticks—partly from a disdain for outside items, partly from a fear of ill-equipped inns. Thus, their luggage was a mountain of miscellaneous items.

After assigning everyone their quarters, Zhuo Yifan returned to the main room. A fruit platter awaited him. Six large white porcelain plates were filled with sliced fruits of various kinds. Though it was only late spring, there was already excellent watermelon, along with many other fruits he didn't recognize—red, green, yellow, a colorful and fragrant display that made the mouth water.

Two large glass jars stood on the table, one filled with sour plum soup, fragrant with osmanthus, the other with a red, refreshingly sour liquid.

The maids quickly took out the masters' tea cups, rinsed them with hot tea, and poured a cup of the refreshing drink for each of them. They soaked new towels, provided by Li Xiaoliu, in cool water, wrung them out, and presented them for wiping away the day's grime.

Li Xiaoliu bustled about, showing the servants how to use the various facilities. Finally, he came to the main room, stood at the door without entering, and asked, "Sir, should your large luggage be stored in the back courtyard, or brought here?"

"Bring it all into the courtyard."

"Yes, sir!" Li Xiaoliu then asked, "Master Zhuo, could you please come to the front desk to sign the guest register?"

Zhuo Yifan followed him to the reception desk. As the young master, he didn't need to write himself; an accountant was there for that. But with over twenty people in their party, it took a long time to report everyone's name, identity, and place of origin. When the registration was complete, Li Xiaoliu said with a smile, "The police will come tomorrow to register your households. It will inevitably be a disturbance. This is official business, so please be patient. This place is not like the Great Ming, the Australians..."

"I understand. Don't worry."

"Yes, it is very considerate of you, sir." Li Xiaoliu then inquired about any large sums of money or valuables. They could be stored at the front desk, or a representative from Delong Bank could be summoned immediately to handle savings and exchange services.

"The silver has already been sent through Delong. We have no valuable items. We only have silver, and not many circulation coupons..."

"No problem, our inn can handle that as well." Li Xiaoliu pointed to a plaque behind the counter displaying the day's exchange rates for gold and silver of various purities, and even copper coins.

Zhuo Yifan nodded noncommittally. In his position, he wouldn't handle the exchange himself. After completing the procedures, Li Xiaoliu presented him with a "Guest Room Facilities User Manual"—improper use of the facilities had caused numerous incidents since the inn's opening.

Zhuo Yifan offered a tip to the attendant before heading back. As he passed another courtyard, he heard someone begging for mercy.

"Third Mistress, have mercy! I'll never do it again. Ouch..."

He recognized the sounds of a wealthy family administering punishment. Amidst the crack of a paddle, a woman's sharp voice cut through the air, "Beat him hard! Break his dog legs!"

Zhuo Yifan sneered and walked on.
