He declined Shucui's offer to find him another companion and instead sent a note out with the clerk, presumably to arrange a meeting with another acquaintance. Liu San, seizing the opportunity, quickly led Shucui away. Bolstered by the condom and alcohol swabs graciously provided by Huang Tianyu, his courage had suddenly surged.

"Little Huang, you should take good care of this, uh, little friend—" Liu San, slightly drunk, said as he led Shucui back to his room and shut the door.

Huang Tianyu groaned inwardly. *Liu San, you old herbalist, you really know how to pick them, leaving me with the loli.* Although he called himself a "loli-con," he didn't have the nerve to blatantly assault a child.

As he was wrestling with his conscience, Qianqian had already poured a cup of wine. She untied a pink handkerchief from her sash, wiped the rim of the cup, and offered it to him with both hands.

Though she was a girl of the night, her manners were gentle and refined. Huang Tianyu felt a growing fondness for her and took her hand, asking, "How old are you?"

Qianqian smiled shyly. "Why do you ask?"

He had assumed she wouldn't understand his broken Cantonese, but to his surprise, she spoke a clear Mandarin similar to the modern Nanjing dialect. Being able to communicate lifted Huang Tianyu's spirits.

"Is it a taboo topic?"

"No taboo," Qianqian replied. "I am fifteen."

Fifteen. Was that a child or a young woman? It was a difficult question. He remembered Yu E'shui explaining that in ancient times, a girl over thirteen was considered an adult, free to marry. At fifteen, she might already have a child or two. But then he thought, in the modern world, Qianqian would still be in middle school... Her slender waist, flat chest, and large, pitiful eyes made it impossible for Huang Tianyu to bring himself to "pounce."

However, to refuse a meal served right to his plate seemed like a terrible waste. A fierce battle raged in Huang Tianyu's mind.

Just then, sounds began to emerge from the next room—the faint moans of a woman, punctuated by Liu San's deep roars.

While he hesitated, Qianqian had already refilled his cup and was offering it to him on her handkerchief.

"No more for me, I've had enough," Huang Tianyu said with a smile, his head already spinning.

"Hmph, just drink it," the girl suddenly demanded, her willow-leaf brows shooting up and her almond eyes wide.

Huang Tianyu, not wanting to lose face, drank another cup. As they say, wine gives a man courage, especially of the amorous kind. Though the girl before him looked like an undeveloped child, his demonic hands couldn't help but reach out. But as he moved, his body suddenly went limp and weak, and he slumped to the floor. A single thought flashed through his mind: "Not good!" The various underworld tricks Yu E'shui had described in his social studies class flooded his memory...

Qianqian looked down at Huang Tianyu, who lay on the floor like a dead pig, his eyes wide open, and snorted triumphantly. She tilted her head back and propped a leg on a stool.

"No matter how cunning you are, you still fell for this old gal's trick!"

Though she called herself "this old gal," her expression was still childish. Looking at the paralyzed Huang Tianyu, a playful look appeared on her face.

"Alright, let's see what interesting things you've got, old man." She tucked the corner of her skirt into her belt and began to rummage through Huang Tianyu's baggage. Huang Tianyu's limbs were numb, and he couldn't move. He cursed his luck inwardly: *Not only did I not get any action, but I ran into a female robber.* Thankfully, he hadn't brought any modern equipment or weapons on this trip, or the loss would have been significant.

"Huh? What's this?" Qianqian pulled a glass jar from his bag. Huang Tianyu recognized it as his Lao Gan Ma chili sauce. It was his last jar, meant to spice up his meals if he found the local food unpalatable. The young girl gripped the jar, turning it over and over, studying it for a long while before tapping it on the headboard. Huang Tianyu's heart pounded with anxiety. He wasn't worried she'd discover anything from the jar—the label had been removed before D-Day—but that she would break it. If it broke, it was gone forever!

Finally, Qianqian managed to open the lid. She had probably never seen a screw-top lid before and examined it with curiosity. Seeing the jar full of red, oily, chopped plants emitting a peculiar aroma, she couldn't resist sticking her tongue out and licking the oily surface. She immediately frowned and spat repeatedly, "Pah! Pah!" Red chili peppers had only recently been introduced in the Ming dynasty, and few people ate them. It seemed she wasn't used to the spicy taste.

*Couldn't you at least dip a finger? Who licks it directly? How am I supposed to eat this now?* Huang Tianyu cursed silently.

Finding the chili sauce unappetizing, Qianqian tossed the jar aside and pulled out Huang Tianyu's underwear, undershirts, and socks. She examined them with curiosity, setting aside a new undershirt and a few pairs of nylon socks while discarding the rest. She then found a pouch of silver fragments and copper coins—his travel allowance—and unceremoniously stuffed it into her blouse.

Next, she found a jar of ketchup, which he had brought for his steamed buns. Having learned from the chili sauce, she opened it quickly and licked it as before.

A strange expression crossed Qianqian's face. She smacked her lips, savoring the sweet and sour taste. Suddenly, her face lit up, and she wrapped the jar up, apparently deciding to keep it.

Huang Tianyu cursed his bad luck. *Why does this little thief want everything, even my undershirt? I've heard of men who have a thing for women's used underwear, but never the other way around.*

In the end, even his Holy Ship brand notebook and pencil were swept away. She used his bedsheet as a makeshift bundle, but when she tried to sling the messy package over her shoulder, it immediately fell apart, spilling everything onto the floor.

"Damn it!" Qianqian stamped her foot, her face showing frustration. She quickly knelt to gather the items. Suddenly, a voice called from outside, "Manager Huang! Manager Huang!"

Huang Tianyu was overjoyed. Someone was here! But his body was weak, and his tongue felt useless; he couldn't call out. He struggled to rock his body, hoping to knock over the chair and make a noise to alert them that something was wrong.

"Don't move!" Qianqian knelt, a small, gleaming dagger suddenly in her hand, pointed straight at his throat. A cold sweat broke out on Huang Tianyu's brow, and he froze.

"Manager Huang is asleep. What is it?" Qianqian called out in a loud voice.

"The front desk is here to clear the dinner table..."

"No need. Come back tomorrow."

"Yes, ma'am." The voice outside faded away. Qianqian let out a breath, put away the dagger, and said, "Sorry, Manager Huang. I didn't mean to rob you, but a girl's got to get by on the road. Please forgive me. As for Sister Shucui, I tricked her. You'd better not report her to the authorities! Or else, you'll be sorry!" She threatened him with a raised fist.

At this point, Huang Tianyu could only accept his fate. At least the losses weren't too great. Whatever this Qianqian's story was, he just wanted her gone.

Qianqian blew out the candle and crouched beside him for a moment. A strange, sweet fragrance drifted to his nose, making him itch with inappropriate thoughts. *Is this the so-called scent of a virgin? Or one of those synthetic human chemicals the perverts in the science department talk about?* As his mind wandered, Qianqian must have decided the coast was clear. She stood up and quietly slipped out the door.

The little menace was finally gone. The more Huang Tianyu thought about it, the more frustrated he became. Liu San was probably still going at it with Shucui. *That guy has a wife, and I don't even have a girlfriend. My 'life secretary' is a promise that never materializes; I live in a dorm with electricity rationing—I don't even have a decent environment for... private time.* He finally gets a chance to indulge on a business trip, and this happens. Why was his luck so bad? As he was wallowing in self-pity, a commotion erupted outside—shouting, running, sounds of a scuffle, and then a woman's scream. The lights came on.

As he wondered what was happening, the door to his room was thrown open. Chen Tong rushed in, shouting, "Manager Huang! Manager Huang!" He scanned the room, saw him on the floor, and quickly dragged him out. Seeing that he was weak and unable to speak, Chen Tong helped him onto the bed.

A crowd of people then poured into the room. Liu San pushed Shucui in front of him. Her hair was disheveled, she wore only an outer robe over her bare feet, and her hands were tied behind her back. She looked terrified, as if she'd been dragged from bed. A moment later, Qianqian was shoved in by several inn clerks, her hair undone and a rope noose around her neck. Her bundle of stolen goods was brought in as well.

The moment Shucui entered, she dropped to her knees, kowtowing and begging for mercy. She claimed she wasn't with Qianqian, that Qianqian had approached her to partner up, and she had only agreed out of pity. She begged Liu San to let her go and not hand her over to the authorities. "Shucui is willing to serve you with all my might, for free."

*You wish you could pay your debt with your body,* Liu San thought, *but I don't have enough condoms for that.*

The inn manager and clerks also spoke up for her, saying Shucui had been singing here for two or three years and had never caused any trouble. This time, she must have been momentarily foolish. They pleaded with Liu San to be lenient.

Liu San knew she had little to do with it; she had just been used by Qianqian. He said, "Write a confession!"

Shucui readily agreed, but since she was illiterate, a clerk wrote it for her, and she pressed her thumbprint on it.

Liu San then turned his attention to Huang Tianyu. He checked his eyelids, opened his mouth to smell his breath, and tested his knee-jerk reflex.
