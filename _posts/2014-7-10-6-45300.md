After this banquet, Huang Binkun was considered "one of them" among this group of scholars. It was only near the end of the banquet that he learned that most of these scholars were members of the "Yuyuan Society." They claimed to be "studying literature, composing poetry, and writing prose," but in reality, it was just a group of people who got together to eat, drink, have fun, write poetry, and discuss state affairs.

This society was loosely organized, and its members were not limited to the students of the Nanhai County School. It also included provincial graduates like Liang Cunhou and unranked scholars like Wu Ming. Lin Zunxiu was the financial backer, while Liang Cunhou was the隱約's leader.

A few days later, Huang Binkun was again invited by Lin Zunxiu to his "villa" for some amusement.

The Lin family's villa was located at the foot of Baiyun Mountain. It had an elegant name, "Bamboo Garden," but it was actually just a separate lodge in the mountain forest. The furnishings were ordinary, but its strength lay in the beautiful surrounding scenery and quiet environment. It was not far from Guangzhou city, allowing for a day trip. Lin Zunxiu used this place as a gathering spot for the members of the Yuyuan Society, especially the core members.

When Huang Binkun arrived, he found that Young Master Liang was already there. Seeing the faint smile on his lips, he immediately understood that the invitation must have been Liang Cunhou's idea.

This was a bit confusing. Although Huang Binkun knew that most members of the Yuyuan Society had a favorable impression of the Cropped-Hair Bandits and intended to profit from their rise, Young Master Liang's attitude was very ambiguous. Huang Binkun instinctively felt that his thoughts were more complex than those of the other members.

Besides Young Master Liang, there were a few other scholars, some of whom he had met at the restaurant, and others who had not been present at the banquet. Both Scholar Shi and the shocking-statement-loving Wu Ming were there. Lin Zunxiu introduced them one by one.

After the servants served tea and they had exchanged some pleasantries, Scholar Lin got to the main topic.

It turned out that these few were all scholars devoted to "Cropped-Hair affairs." Among them, the most interested was, paradoxically, Young Master Liang, who rarely spoke of the "Australians" in public.

In terms of connections with the Australians, he was probably second only to Gao Ju in Guangzhou. When Guo Yi first established the charity hall and started his businesses, the Liang family had contributed a great deal. Later, when the Ming army attacked Lingao, the Liang family had secretly protected Guo Yi's local assets and personnel in many ways. So, as soon as Guo Yi returned to Guangzhou, he had quietly paid him a visit.

However, their interactions were limited to this. The Liang family was from a long line of officials and was extremely cautious about their dealings with the Australians. They were unwilling to be too closely associated with them. After all, consorting with overseas people not only sounded bad but was also an easy way to get into trouble.

Although they kept their distance, Liang Cunhou had always been very interested in everything about the Australians. In his view, although the influence of the Australians was growing daily in Guangzhou, and many scholars talked about "Australians" and "Cropped-Hair studies," most of it was just scratching the surface. No one truly understood the Cropped-Hair Bandits.

The Yuyuan Society gave him a great opportunity to gather like-minded people and study the Australians—due to his status, he couldn't openly discuss "Cropped-Hair studies" or collect materials on the bandits. With the cover of the Yuyuan Society, it was much easier. A group of scholars devoted to Cropped-Hair studies gathered around him. They used this place to discuss Cropped-Hair studies, collect various "Australian books," and dreamed of one day being able to implement "Cropped-Hair affairs" to enrich the country, strengthen the military, and support a Ming restoration.

Huang Binkun was secretly alarmed. He never thought there would be such a group of people in Guangzhou! But judging by their words, they were neither like the scholars at the restaurant who were eager to "follow a new dragon," nor were they like the officials who feared the Cropped-Hair Bandits like tigers. They seemed to have some "concern for the country and the people."

*These are the people I'm looking for!* Huang Binkun was secretly pleased.

The conversation began with a new Australian book that Scholar Lin had bought, *A Brief Introduction to Physics*. He bought this book because they had heard that many of the Australians' "marvelous contraptions" were based on it. In fact, this book was based on a popular science book on physics, covering the most basic physics knowledge such as mass, the interaction of forces, and the conservation of energy. It contained no practical knowledge. For scholars who were used to being immersed in poetry and classics, it was a bit too profound.

Because Huang Binkun had seen Huang Ping's textbooks and had heard him explain some of it, he was able to make some sense of it. He picked out what he knew and explained it in detail.

"Cropped-Hair studies are indeed profound," Lin Zunxiu shook his head. "It seems that if we really want to implement Cropped-Hair affairs, we must have specialized talent."

"Back then, when Manager Li wanted to buy a cannon factory from the Australians and hire their artisans, the Australians wouldn't allow it," Scholar Shi said. "I think this will be difficult."

"If they won't hire them out, we can send people to learn!" Huang Binkun interjected.

"Go and learn?" Several people stared with wide eyes.

"That's right," Huang Binkun nodded. "The Cropped-Hair Bandits are fond of being teachers. They have set up schools in Lingao, teaching their own knowledge. They recruit students from all over—I even sent a servant boy to learn their ways."

"How is he learning?" Liang Cunhou was very concerned. "Has he learned the methods of casting cannons and building ships?"

"That is the highest level of Cropped-Hair studies. He hasn't learned it yet, but this book," Huang Binkun pointed at *A Brief Introduction to Physics* with his fan, "he understands it all."

"Such a thing exists!" Lin Zunxiu was very excited. "Brother Huang, do you have any connections? I also want to send a few servant boys to learn Cropped-Hair studies!"

"Brother Lin, don't force the issue," Liang Cunhou said. "We can discuss this matter slowly."

Huang Binkun quickly said, "The Australians are very strict with their internal and external security. They don't accept outside students at all. But it's not impossible to find a way, but..."

"But what? Is the tuition expensive? Don't worry about that."

"It's not a matter of money," Huang Binkun thought of his own Huang Ping and couldn't help but sigh. "Gentlemen, you may not know, but the Australians are most skilled at confusing people's minds. A good child, after entering their school for just a year or two, becomes a 'fake Cropped-Hair.' They forget their masters, their ancestors fade away, and all principles of heaven and human relationships are cast aside, replaced entirely by Australian knowledge and Australian rules..."

"We must find older children who are strong-willed and can read."

"Where can we find such children!" Scholar Shi said. "Which family would be willing to send a child who can read to learn Cropped-Hair studies? As for ordinary servants, they are all ignorant and dull. If it's as Brother Huang says, won't they be just as easily confused after going..."

"It seems this matter is very difficult."

When it came to Cropped-Hair studies, Lin Zunxiu was the most interested and considered himself the most knowledgeable. He couldn't help but launch into a grand speech: "Difficult or not, we must find a way! Cropped-Hair studies are the most urgent matter! Since the iron ships came north in the early years of Chongzhen, entered our Qiongzhou, and defeated our royal army, in just three or four years, they have become like a state. They build machines, repair warships, and lure the people to cross the sea to join them. The government can do nothing to stop them! This is truly a great change in three thousand years. China's bows and spears, muskets and cannons, cannot match the guns and cannons of the Cropped-Hair people. China's boats and ships cannot match their steam-powered warships. Therefore, we are constrained at every turn. In today's situation, to talk extravagantly of expelling the barbarians and driving them out is certainly empty talk. Even to maintain peace and defend our territory is empty talk without guns and warships. I believe that the path to self-strengthening lies in learning what they are capable of and seizing what they rely on. Therefore, we cannot but study Cropped-Hair studies and implement Cropped-Hair affairs. Set up cannon factories, build shipyards. The guns and ships of the Cropped-Hair people are mostly made in Qiongzhou, using the iron of our China, and the craftsmen are nothing more than refugee commoners. Yet they can use them to invade our great Ming. If we can truly master their methods, we can also build ships and cannons like the Cropped-Hair people, and perhaps even surpass them. Then we will not have to worry about annihilating the Cropped-Hair bandits!"

Huang Binkun listened intently to this grand discourse, greatly impressed by his argument of "a great change in three thousand years." This was a deafening cry, but unfortunately, the emperor, the ministers of the central government, and the governors and financial commissioners of the provinces could not hear it. Besides Australian goods, probably no one truly realized the depth of the Cropped-Hair Bandits' schemes.

"Brother Lin, your use of the phrase 'a great change in three thousand years' to summarize today's situation is very concise and moving. With this as your principle, you could write a great article with the content you just mentioned, circulate it, and shake the world."

"Heh heh, if I wrote this article, wouldn't the scholars of the world curse me to death?" A helpless smile appeared on Lin Zunxiu's face. "To say I'm 'alarmist' would be the least of it. If they said I was 'blaspheming the sacred teachings,' I would be doomed forever."

Liang Cunhou gently tapped his fan against his palm. "Brother Lin, you worry too much. Whether it's studying Cropped-Hair studies, implementing Cropped-Hair affairs, or adopting their good methods and systems, there is one fundamental point to always remember: it must be based on our Chinese teachings. With the ethics and teachings of China as the foundation, supplemented by the Cropped-Hair people's methods of enriching the country and strengthening the military."

"Exactly! Brother Liang has said it well!" Several people clapped their hands in agreement. "As they say, 'Cropped-Hair studies for practical use, Chinese studies for the core.' We must learn the strengths of the Australians, but we must not lose the legacy of our ancestors!"

Huang Binkun deeply agreed. Just as he was about to speak, Scholar Shi interjected, "By studying Cropped-Hair studies and implementing Cropped-Hair affairs, even if we can't annihilate the Australians, we can at least protect ourselves." Despite his peaceful, portly appearance, Scholar Shi was not at all vague when discussing matters. "When the Australians brought their troops to the White Swan Pool and burned the Five Rams Courier Station, our army was powerless to resist. Fortunately, the Australians are fond of business and profit. Otherwise, I'm afraid this city of Guangzhou would have fallen into their hands long ago!"

Wu Ming sneered, "Is it not theirs now? I'm not being alarmist, but if the Australians want this city of Guangzhou, it's as easy as lifting a hand."

"That's right, this city of Guangzhou is a mountain of gold and a sea of silver."

"Then why don't they take it?" Liang Cunhou suddenly asked.

"For business," Wu Ming snapped his fan shut. "It's not difficult for the Australians to take Guangzhou. The difficulty is that once they take Guangzhou, they can no longer do business with the great Ming. So what if there's a mountain of gold and a sea of silver in the city? What they value is not money!"

Huang Binkun couldn't help but agree, "Well said! Although the Cropped-Hair people are fond of business and profit, that is not their true goal!"

"Then what are they after?"
