After interrogation by the Public Security Team, the captured pirates quickly confessed everything. Surprisingly, they were not under the command of the infamous Liu Xiang, but belonged to the forces of Zhu Cailao. Zhu Cailao's sphere of activity was the waters off Guangdong. Among the various maritime powers of the time, his group was not as famous as the Zheng family, Liu Xiang, Li Kuaiqi, or Zhong Lingxiu, but he had started his career much earlier than Zheng Zhilong. In the 48th year of the Wanli era, while Zheng Zhilong was still serving under Yan Siqi, Zhu Cailao already commanded two fleets, one for the north and one for the south. In that year, he launched three consecutive attacks on Jieyang in the second, fourth, and seventh months, followed by an assault on Chenghai in the ninth month. He attacked Jieyang again in the first year of the Tianqi era, making him a very active maritime group during that period.

From the captives, the transmigrators learned about the organizational structure of these maritime groups along the southeast coast, who were part merchant, part pirate. Although they had a unified organization and a leader, their activities were generally conducted in "shares" (股). As an intermediate unit between the leadership and individual ships, the head of a "share," known as the "manager" (掌柜), played a crucial role in the chain of command. He appointed the captains of each vessel, relayed the leader's orders to them, and was responsible for the conduct of his subordinates. The number of ships in each share varied; some had as few as two or three, while larger shares could have up to forty. The responsibilities and obligations between each share and the leader differed based on their closeness to the leader. Shares not directly affiliated with the leader could operate freely most of the time but had to abide by the group's internal rules and pay the leader a certain percentage of their profits, whether from plunder or trade. When the leader summoned the shares for a collective action, all were required to participate unconditionally.

[Note: Due to limited resources, I was unable to find information on the organizational structure of major maritime groups during the Ming Dynasty. This structure is based on that of Guangdong pirates in the early 19th century.]

These three ships belonged to a "manager" under Zhu Cailao, a core member of his group. Their mission to Lingao was deeply connected to the Gou family.

The Gou family, whose pigs had been slaughtered by the transmigrators, was a major "fence" for Zhu Cailao's group. Much of Zhu Cailao's stolen goods were first transported to Lingao for temporary storage and then sold in batches throughout Guangdong via the Gou family's network in Qiongshan.

News of the Gou family's demise took nearly half a month to reach Zhu Cailao. Gou Er, from the county seat of Lingao, had vanished with his entire family the day after the Gou family estate was destroyed. He didn't even report to Zhu Cailao. Gou Er was a clear-headed man: how could a powerful pirate lord like that swallow such a loss? If he went to report it, he would surely have to offer a huge compensation to get through it, possibly losing his entire fortune. And that was not all. Zhu Cailao would surely retaliate against the "Short Hairs" (transmigrators), and as a local, he would be forced to act as the vanguard. He couldn't afford to provoke either side, so he chose to disappear and stay out of it for the time being. As for avenging his elder brother, he knew Zhu Cailao would eventually find out and deal with the Short Hairs himself. Relying on a great pirate was a much surer bet than a fallen local tyrant like himself.

Thus, Zhu Cailao was kept completely in the dark until one of his contacts found the Gou family estate reduced to ruins, with a new fortress being built on top. Only then did he realize the Gou family was finished. He sent men to the county seat to find Gou Er, but there was no trace of him. Through subsequent inquiries, they pieced together a rough picture of what had happened.

The destruction of his fence and the loss of his stolen goods was a devastating blow to Zhu Cailao. He had received word that Zheng Zhilong, who had just been pacified by the imperial court, was preparing to move against him. Just when he needed to build ships and recruit soldiers for the coming battle, he suffered this heavy setback. Years of accumulated wealth were gone in an instant. This was not just a financial loss; it severely shook the confidence of his followers. Pirate groups were communities of shared interest. When the leader's resources were destroyed and he could no longer guarantee the interests of his men, the various affiliated factions naturally began to have second thoughts. Other groups, who had been eyeing his position, took the opportunity to lure away his "managers." For a time, dozens of shares, comprising over a hundred ships, either left without a word or refused his summons.

The transmigrators themselves had no idea that their action of wiping out the Gou family, purely to "improve their diet," had set off a chain reaction along the southeast coast. The biggest beneficiary, surprisingly, was the Zheng family group, whom they had always considered their greatest future enemy. Overwhelmed and furious, Zhu Cailao immediately dispatched several groups of ships to Lingao to gather information—who had dared to challenge the tiger in his own territory.

Soon, information about the "Short Hairs" reached him. He had heard of this group before—their strange, large iron ship had been a popular topic of gossip among Guangdong fishermen for months. Gou Da had mentioned these peculiar Short Hairs in his letters, calling them Australian sea merchants. He also knew that their firearms were incredibly powerful, having defeated all of Lingao's local militia.

Zhu Cailao had been somewhat concerned about these "Australian pirates"—in this era, sea merchants and pirates were one and the same—appearing in his sphere of influence. However, since landing in Lingao, this group had stayed put. They showed no intention of trading, nor did they send out raiding parties. In Lingao, they maintained an ambiguous presence with an attitude of "we won't bother you if you don't bother us." With the threat of the Zheng family to deal with, he had tacitly tolerated the Short Hairs' existence.

Now, Zhu Cailao had two choices. The first was to immediately gather his forces to attack the Short Hairs, recover his lost wealth and goods, and restore his prestige. In the past, he would have done so without hesitation. But now, with Zheng Zhilong watching like a tiger, and the Short Hairs being no easy target, a mutually destructive conflict would only benefit Zheng Zhilong. The second choice was to do nothing, focus his strength on preparing for the confrontation with Zheng Zhilong. The problem was, without the vast resources stored at the Gou estate, he couldn't raise enough funds and supplies in time.

While he hesitated, his spies reported that the Short Hairs possessed some incredibly fast boats. These boats were comparable in size to a large Guang-style ship but moved with a speed that surpassed any vessel they had ever seen, including the various Western sailing ships that roamed these waters. The fast boats had no sails, meaning they didn't have to worry about being set on fire by the enemy in naval battles. With such a ship, his fleet would gain a significant advantage at sea.

This decided it for Zhu Cailao. He resolved to attack the Short Hairs. To this end, he sent many spies to Lingao for reconnaissance. From local fishermen, he learned that the enemy had taken over the fishing grounds and that their fast boats patrolled the bay daily, inspecting for illegal fishing. From his spies, Zhu Cailao learned the following:

1.  The Short Hairs' muskets were the most formidable—long-range, highly lethal, and capable of continuous fire.
2.  In contrast to their sharp muskets, the Short Hairs had no cannons. Even their fast boats were armed with strange, large crossbow-like devices.
3.  They had a total of four fast boats. Usually, only one was on patrol in the fishing grounds, while the others remained hidden in the bay. It seemed they treasured these boats greatly. Their enormous iron ship remained anchored and motionless.
4.  The Short Hairs were not numerous, estimated by the spies to be around a thousand men. They were divided into "true kun" and "false kun," though the spies couldn't distinguish between them. They were split into two locations: Bairen Beach and Bopu Port. Both places were fortified, but Bopu had fewer people and weaker defenses. Additionally, the former Gou estate and a place called Yanchang Village were also under their control.

Zhu Cailao had never read any books on warfare, nor did he understand strategy or tactics. But he had enough wisdom to judge which course of action would yield the greatest benefit—at his core, he was a merchant and understood the principle of getting the best value for his efforts.

After weighing all the information, Zhu Cailao made a wise decision: he would not launch an all-out war against the Short Hairs. The scope of the battle would be limited to capturing their "fast boats" to enhance his fleet's combat power, and if possible, to seize some of their muskets as well.

Although the Short Hairs' muskets were formidable, they lacked sufficient manpower and cannons, two things Zhu Cailao had in abundance. After consulting with his key commanders, he dispatched his most capable general to carry out the mission of capturing the boats.

The plan was quite clever. Through long-term observation by fishermen acting as spies, they had figured out the transmigrators' routines and operational methods. They devised a targeted strategy: use illegal fishing to lure a "fast boat" to approach for an inspection, then use cannon fire and boarding parties to clear the "Short Hairs" from the deck. To this end, all cannons were loaded with grapeshot to avoid causing too much damage to the "fast boat." They even prepared two types of ropes on their ships: thick ones for towing the "fast boat" and thin ones for tying up captured Short Hairs. Zhu Cailao had given orders: captured Short Hairs were to be treated well, as only they knew how to operate the fast boats and muskets.

Everything was planned meticulously. Against any other ship, Zhu Cailao's plan would have succeeded. Fortunately, the fishing trawler, with its technology far beyond the era, and the combat organization the transmigrators had developed over the past few months, thwarted this perfect plan. The share manager in charge of the operation was also killed in the battle.

While the victory was worth celebrating, the underlying threat remained—no one knew if Zhu Cailao had any follow-up plans. If he did, what scale of attack was he preparing? No matter how much the Public Security Team tortured the captives, they couldn't get any more information. The captured leader swore up and down that he only knew about the plan to seize the boat and nothing else.

"Looks like everyone's going to be busy again," He Ming said thoughtfully, taking out a cigarette. He was about to light it but stopped. "My apologies, this is the arsenal. I'm getting muddled." He tapped his own head.

"It's fine, go ahead and smoke. This isn't an explosives factory. Those cannons are just chunks of iron; nothing will happen."

"Still, better not to break the rules," He Ming said. "The Executive Committee is holding a response meeting tomorrow. The leaders of all specialized groups need to attend. Your artillery team should send a few more people. The recent focus has been on the fortifications at Bopu and arming the navy's ships."

"Producing cannons isn't a big problem, but the supply of raw materials is scarce," said [Zhan Wuya][y004]. "We're very short on coal."
