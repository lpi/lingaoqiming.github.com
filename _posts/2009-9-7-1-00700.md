[Wen Desi][y002], after selling the gold in this time-space, received nearly 270,000 yuan because the purity was not high enough. He then found a small smelter, had the silver re-melted into standard 925 industrial silver, and sold it for another 200,000 yuan.

As for the several large baskets of porcelain, leaving them in the hotel room was not a solution, but moving them all at once would be impossible to explain how so much stuff suddenly appeared in the room. So they had to stay for a few more days, with the three of them taking turns transporting them in suitcases every day.

After counting, there were a total of two hundred pieces of porcelain, mostly various kinds of plates, but also many bowls and vases. Although they knew it was Kraak porcelain, they were after all amateurs in the antiques business.

[Wen Desi][y002] remembered a Professor Ma he had met at a dinner party in the past. He taught in the history department of a famous local university and also enjoyed collecting antiques, having a small reputation in the collection circle. After frantically flipping through his name card book, he found Professor Ma's phone number and arranged to have lunch with him to discuss something.

"That's right, this is Kraak porcelain," Professor Ma said as he examined the plate in his hand. "A typical export porcelain. The characteristic of this type of porcelain is its wide rim, mostly blue and white, with decorations of landscapes, figures, flowers, and fruits painted in divided sections and circular medallions on the rim of the plates and bowls."

[Wen Desi][y002] put on an attitude of humbly receiving instruction.

"Kraak porcelain is divided into Wanli and Kangxi periods by date. This one of yours is from the Wanli period. In the patterns, all the circles are pieced together with two strokes, which is a characteristic of porcelain painting from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties."

[Wen Desi][y002] thought to himself that this was clearly from the Tianqi era.

"So this porcelain plate is quite valuable then?"

"Don't just think about money when it comes to cultural relics," Professor Ma said with a look of disdain. "The value of a cultural relic is mainly its historical and cultural connotation."

He turned it over and over in his hands, looking at it with a bit of fondness. Suddenly, he frowned slightly: "This plate hasn't lost its 'fire' yet. It couldn't be a high-quality fake, could it? Where did you get it?"

[Wen Desi][y002] thought, *I can't possibly say I got it from another time-space, fresh from the kiln.* "I saw a villager selling it at a stall when I was on business in the countryside. The pattern was quite special, so I bought a few pieces."

"You were very observant to notice that." Professor Ma nodded in appreciation. "Kraak porcelain is actually a product made to order. The patterns and decorations are all catered to European aesthetic tastes. Some are even directly based on designs provided by Europeans."

"So it should be authentic then?" [Wen Desi][y002] put on an eager look, as if anxious to know its authenticity.

"It should be," Professor Ma pondered for a moment. "However, the stock of this kind of porcelain in the country is not large, and most of the goods on the market are salvaged from the sea. But this plate has clearly not been soaked in water."

"If it is authentic, what is the market price like now?"

"Well, the market for ceramics is rather complicated, and it has been generally sluggish recently. But Kraak porcelain is a hot item, with the highest sales rate among ceramics. However, the value of a single piece is not that great. A plate like this could probably sell for three or four thousand yuan."

"That's not bad either." [Wen Desi][y002] put on a smug look as if he had found a bargain.

"It's just that the authenticity is a bit unclear," Professor Ma leaned back comfortably in his chair, a subtle smile behind his glasses. "This plate of yours, no matter how you look at it, it has all the characteristics, but it still has that 'fire'. Generally speaking, high-quality fakes of Kraak porcelain are rare, and I haven't heard of any cases of 'buried mines' (traps for collectors)."

[Wen Desi][y002] looked anxious: "Professor Ma, do you think this thing is real or not?"

Professor Ma thought for a while: "How about this, I have a friend who specializes in porcelain collection. He is an expert in this circle. I'll give you his number, and you can make an appointment with him to have a look. If it's the real thing, he will definitely want it."

The expert Professor Ma introduced was also named Ma, but he was not a relative of Professor Ma. He was considered a big shot in the collection circle. As soon as [Wen Desi][y002] brought his things over, the expert wanted all two hundred pieces. The expert was very suspicious that [Wen Desi][y002] had dug up a porcelain cellar in Fujian, because not only were Old Wen's items in excellent condition, but his words also implied that there were more to come. Dealer Ma knew that because the price of Kraak porcelain was moderate, it was quite easy to sell. Having a stable source of goods was naturally something he couldn't ask for more. He said that if there were more goods, he could continue to bring them.

After selling the gold, silver, and porcelain, the profit from this trip was nearly three million yuan. With this money as startup capital, the Executive Committee began to take further action.

Renting a hotel room again was obviously not very appropriate. [Wen Desi][y002] decided to set up a company. He spent twenty thousand yuan to have an agent handle all the procedures, and a trading company was born. [Xiao Zishan][y001] had already been informed by his company that his "labor contract would not be renewed," so he simply went full-time, taking on the title of Administrative Manager. [Wen Desi][y002] also wanted to resign, but there was a lot of work at his company, and his boss was quite good to him, so it was not good to just leave. However, after much persuasion, he finally arranged to leave in three months. [Wang Luobin][y003] was much more carefree. He just handed in a letter of resignation and came to Guangzhou. He actually went directly to a small machinery factory to work as a worker, saying he wanted to "familiarize himself with the craft."

The company had nothing when it was first established. Fortunately, [Xiao Zishan][y001] had been in Guangzhou for many years. Working in sales, he had a wide range of contacts. Now that he had money, everything was easy to handle. The office was a long-term business suite rented in the original hotel. This kind of business suite was an independent unit. Entry and exit did not require passing through the lobby, it was relatively quiet, and it also came with an underground parking space, which was very convenient. [Xiao Zishan][y001] used a small warehouse inside as the crossing point for the wormhole and installed a separate security door. To meet the needs of moving large quantities of goods in the next step, he bought a hydraulic hand truck.

On the matter of the company car, the Executive Committee had its first disagreement. [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s opinion was to buy a seven-seater small-displacement passenger car similar to the Changan Star. It was cheap, could carry many people, could also transport goods, and was fuel-efficient. [Wang Luobin][y003], on the other hand, believed that since they were going to the 17th century, such a car would be useless in that time and space—there was no gasoline in the Ming Dynasty, and the road conditions were not suitable for such a small car. So he suggested buying a four-wheel-drive diesel-powered off-road vehicle—in comparison, a substitute for diesel would be easier to obtain.

After several hours of discussion on this issue, the three members of the Executive Committee finally decided to buy an SUV. The car saleswoman was puzzled by the men's choice. They rejected the newer, more fuel-efficient model with an electronic fuel injection engine and instead bought an old model Cherokee Jeep: four-wheel drive, manual transmission, diesel power, with a self-rescue winch.

They had a car, and they had a channel to make money. What to do next? The three members of the Executive Committee sat at the conference room table, discussing their next plan.
