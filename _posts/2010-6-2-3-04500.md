However, the sugar produced here was a very dark color, even deeper than the usual brown sugar, almost what one would call "black sugar."

The substance that dripped from the earthenware jars was blackish, which Wen Tong knew to be "molasses." As the sugarcane juice was boiled and the sugar crystals continuously formed, this dark mother liquor was what remained. It still contained a significant amount of sugar, but extracting it economically was impossible until after the 1970s. Before then, molasses was simply a byproduct that had to be utilized in other ways. One of the most promising uses was for distilling alcohol—rum, specifically, is made from molasses.

The workers called the drippings "slop sugar" and said it could be further boiled down into a type of black rock sugar, which could be used in food but was not suitable for export.

Wen Tong shook his head. There was no point in making this black sugar; its economic value was too low. It would be better to use it for distilling alcohol. He asked, "Does anyone here make white sugar or rock candy?"

The workers all shook their heads. Liao Dahua translated, explaining that no one in Xuwen or Haikang made white sugar or rock candy. All the sugar mills produced this kind of reddish-brown sugar. Some also made sugar bricks by boiling the cane juice into a paste, pouring it into a large iron basin, stirring it frequently with a wooden stick until it crystallized, then pouring it into a square mold and cutting it into blocks. These sugar bricks were wrapped in dry sugarcane leaves and packed in large bamboo baskets, with 50 bricks per basket.

Wen Tong recalled that the true method for making white sugar had emerged in the late Ming Dynasty, using a technique of washing it with yellow mud water. It wasn't a difficult technique, so why wasn't anyone here using it?

He calculated the entire sugar-making process and estimated that this mill's daily output of reddish-brown sugar was about 100 kilograms. The scale was pitifully small. Moreover, from what he had just observed, although the lead stoker was familiar with the overall process, he clearly lacked experience in the specific operations. He hesitated when it came to controlling the fire, timing the sugar extraction, and adding the right amount of lime. The resulting sugar was of obviously low quality. Due to the poor design of the stove, the fire was difficult to regulate, and several pots of sugar syrup were scorched. After adding the lime, the sediment was discarded before it had fully settled, resulting in a significant loss of sugar. There was plenty of room for improvement here.

As he was contemplating this, someone brought over several nearby sugarcane farmers. Wen Tong questioned them one by one. Their plots were all very small, some as little as a dozen mu, the largest only thirty or forty. According to them, each mu could produce over three dan of sugar. They grew the cane, and after harvesting, they brought it here for processing. This mill took a share of the processed product: forty percent for the mill, sixty for the farmer. In other places, farmers paid a fee for processing, and the product was all theirs. The costs worked out to be about the same either way.

As for where the sugar went, the farmers said that whether it was produced by the mill itself or processed on behalf of the farmers, most of it ended up being transported to Haian Street in Haikang, where it was bought by sugar merchants. These merchants were mostly from Chaozhou and Guangzhou and specialized in exporting the local sugar. The bags of sugar were loaded onto ships at Haian Port and shipped out.

"How much money do you actually make from growing sugarcane like this?" Wen Tong was curious.

"One mu can net about six or seven thousand wen," one of the farmers said. "The taxes are heavy, but the income is still decent. The problem is the high interest rates. After paying back the principal and interest, there's not much left."

"Interest?" Wen Tong found this strange. Did they have to borrow money to grow sugarcane?

"This is where you gentlemen don't understand the hardships of us farmers," the farmer said with a bitter smile. "Growing sugarcane is profitable, but it consumes a lot of water and fertilizer. Just buying fertilizer is a big expense. If it doesn't rain, we have to hire people to water the fields. And during the harvest, we have to hire laborers. The expenses for one mu are at least four or five thousand wen. We country folk don't have ready cash, so we have to borrow."

The interest rate on the loans was fifteen to twenty percent, which didn't seem exorbitant, but after the sugar was processed, the farmers had to split the profits evenly with their creditors. This meant their income was cut in half. Both Wen Tong and Chang Shide thought this was an outrageously exploitative practice.

"I see," Wen Tong nodded. "Since I'm the new owner here, I want to offer you all some benefits. For this harvest season, anyone who comes here to have their sugar processed will only be charged a thirty percent share."

"Thank you for your kindness, Manager!" The farmers were so grateful they were on the verge of kneeling and kowtowing. This was a ten percent reduction in the fee, which meant a considerable amount of extra money for each family.

After dismissing the crowd, Wen Tong returned to the main hall, with Liao Dahua and the others following closely behind.

"Manager Liao, you're the head of the branch here. We've kept you for several days. The branch in Haikang—" Wen Tong felt a bit apologetic.

"It's no problem, no problem," Liao Dahua said quickly. "The Haikang branch was set up for Patron Guo in the first place. Whatever he instructs, I will naturally do my utmost to accomplish." Although he was the manager of a Qiwei branch, he wasn't a martial artist or an escort. He was a bankrupt small merchant. The branch in Leizhou wasn't intended for escort services but to assist Patron Guo with his business, making someone like him the perfect fit for the job.

"His Lordship"—Wen Tong thought to himself that Guo Yi was really putting on airs now. He said, "We don't have anyone here at the moment, so we need some help. We need to find a foreman and hire a sugar master. These are urgent matters. We're not familiar with the area, so we'll have to trouble you with this."

Although he had already identified many flaws in the process, technological improvements couldn't happen overnight. They required not only new equipment but also modifications to the basic infrastructure. He didn't have the time for that right now. With the harvest season about to begin, the most practical approach was to stick to the old methods for now and start producing sugar as quickly as possible.

"Of course, of course," Liao Dahua nodded repeatedly. "Leave it all to me. I'll have it done within three days."

"Don't worry too much about the wages. We need people right now. Also, if you can recruit any long-term laborers or if anyone is selling themselves into servitude, choose the honest and reliable ones and bring them in."

"Yes." He took a step closer and lowered his voice. "If there are any suitable girls, should I purchase a few to take care of the daily needs of you and Master Chang? The two women sent from Guangzhou are a bit rough and clumsy; I'm afraid they won't be able to serve you well."

"Yes, yes," Chang Shide said eagerly. "Not too young, and they shouldn't be too skinny."

Wen Tong gave him a troubled look. The man was a bit too eager. It wasn't that he was against the idea—the Executive Committee had granted them the authority to recruit locals—but to be so anxious for women right after arriving would not look good if word got back.

"I think we should hold off on that for now," Wen Tong said. "We've just arrived in Leizhou, and we still need to visit other places. We'll probably be on the road for a few weeks. It would be a hassle to bring a maid along. It's more convenient to have the two servant boys with us." At these words, the two boys standing nearby blushed and lowered their heads in silence.

Liao Dahua was taken aback for a moment. His eyes scanned the scene, and a look of "sudden realization" dawned on his face.

"Yes, yes, I was being presumptuous."

Neither of them had any idea what he had "suddenly realized," but they had too much to do to dwell on it. It was getting late, so Liao Dahua and his men took their leave. The escorts he had brought with him were stationed around the estate for protection. Liao Dahua didn't dare to be careless—Xuwen was the most lawless place in the entire Leizhou Prefecture, rampant with bandits and robbers. Sugarcane plantations and sugar mills, with their valuable assets, were prime targets for raids. Zhou Shizhai and Li Biao stayed in the room next to Wen Tong and Chang Shide's, ready to respond at a moment's notice.

In the evening, the two servant women sent from Guangzhou came to pay their respects. Though not stout, they were surprisingly strong. First, they brought in newly made, deep, and large bathing tubs, followed by a continuous stream of buckets of hot water and soap beans. After two days of dusty travel, a bath was exactly what they needed. Wen Tong stripped down and soaked in the hot water for a good while before climbing out. He sat on a bamboo stool and lathered himself with the soap beans. Although they didn't spread easily, the areas he applied them to became smooth and slick, with a fresh, fragrant scent—much better than the soap issued by the administrative office in Lingao.

"Old Chang, help me with the soap," Wen Tong called out to Chang Shide, who was soaking in the hot water with his eyes closed in contentment.

"You should ask Wen Xiu and his brother to do that. Aren't they our servants? That's their job. Let me enjoy this a little longer," Chang Shide said, a look of blissful ecstasy on his face as he splashed in the water.

Wen Tong thought that made sense. He could get his back scrubbed at the same time. He cleared his throat and called out. Wen Xiu immediately came in from the next room, having changed into a short shirt and trousers, barefoot.

"Master's body is truly sturdy," Wen Xiu said as he vigorously scrubbed Wen Tong's back.

"Hmph, him? He's just a skinny fellow. Strong?" Chang Shide made a loud splashing sound. "Look at my chest muscles—this Ghost Head Saber isn't for show."

Wen Xiu fell silent. Wen Tong asked, "Who did you learn your Mandarin from?"

"I learned it from Head Steward Sun."

Wen Tong and Chang Shide already knew from their briefing that Head Steward Sun was Sun Chang, one of the main local staff members at the Guangzhou station.

"That Guo fellow must have a lot of people working for him."

Wen Xiu hesitated, unsure if the "Guo fellow" the master was referring to was the god-like Patron Guo they all revered. After a moment's pause, he replied, "Yes, dozens of them. They all learn Mandarin from Steward Sun. Patron Guo says it's to prepare for the masters who will be coming in the future—"

Chang Shide chuckled. "That Guo fellow really knows how to get things done. We've just arrived in Leizhou, and we're already fully staffed with servants. Otherwise, we wouldn't even have anyone to order around." He yawned. "Today was so boring. It reminded me of watching a folk performance. By the way, do you have any plans for improving the sugar production?"

"There are improvements to be made, but we can't make major changes right away. We'll have to make do for now," Wen Tong said. He gestured, and Wen Xiu scooped up clean water from a nearby bucket to rinse him off. The warm water was incredibly pleasant. "Tomorrow, we'll go check the fields, and then we need to visit the other plantations and mills to see the situation."

"Come on, scrub my back too!" Chang Shide climbed out of the tub. His body was much more robust than Wen Tong's. Although he was overweight, he exercised regularly, and since D-Day, he had done a lot of manual labor. His chest, abdomen, and thighs were covered in solid muscle. Wen Xiu looked at his physique with a mixture of awe and envy, and said with a fawning smile, "Master has a fine build." He began to scrub his back.

"I think there are too many sugar mills. We should just consolidate them, create a centralized factory for large-scale production. It would be easier to manage, and we could utilize the bagasse more efficiently."

"I thought of that too, but the farmers all prefer to process their cane nearby. Who would want to travel long distances just to sell their sugarcane? It's too much trouble, and the roads here are terrible," Wen Tong said. "We'll have to see how these plantations are distributed. If they're too spread out, the sugar industry in Leizhou will be a mess."

His thoughts were actually much more complex. He had already gotten a general overview of the Leizhou sugar industry today. What to do next would depend on further investigation. As for improvements, it wasn't just a matter of processing equipment and production techniques. He had already examined the sugarcane used for pressing in the mill and found it to be bamboo cane. This was a native Chinese variety, and while it was specifically grown for sugar, its sugar content was lower than that of "Kunlun cane"—even though the latter was technically a fruit cane. Even in Leizhou, a region perfectly suited for sugarcane, the sugar content of bamboo cane was only about 9%, far below the 14% standard for modern sugar varieties. From this perspective, there was great potential for improving the sugarcane varieties themselves. The agricultural department had preserved seedlings of many improved sugarcane varieties, which could be tested here. As for field management, there was even more room for improvement.

"That's true... oh, ah, that feels good. You're quite good at massage," Chang Shide groaned in pleasure as he was being attended to.

"We've been trained in the full range of service skills," Wen Xiu said, massaging his back with flattering diligence.

"What if we do the initial processing locally and then transport the brown sugar here to be refined into white sugar?"

"I've been thinking about that too, but we need to see the situation in each location first."

After their bath, the servant women came to empty the dirty water and tidy the room, taking their discarded clothes to be washed. A short while later, dinner was served, along with wine. It was a local brew from Xuwen called "Xuwen Liquid," made from jackfruit. Liao Dahua and Zhou Shizhai joined them for the meal, both having a symbolic drink. Wen Tong wasn't much of a drinker, so most of the wine ended up being consumed by Chang Shide. Although not drunk, he was a little tipsy. Wen Tong had no choice but to have Wen Xiu help the man back to his room. He had planned to discuss matters with him that evening, but now it seemed he would have to go to bed as soon as it got dark.
