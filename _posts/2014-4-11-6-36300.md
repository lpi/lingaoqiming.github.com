Suddenly, there was another commotion. A few men and women with armbands were pushing and shoving the fleeing Bai Siwen. His square scarf was gone, his bright red shoes were covered in black footprints, and his lake-blue silk robe was torn in several places. He was tied up tightly and looked extremely pathetic.

A few of the men and women shouted, "You think you can run after harassing a woman? Go to the police station and explain yourself."

Bai Siwen was still trying to defend himself. "I was just passing by and looking. I don't know them."

But the men and women paid no attention to his explanations. They tied up the fallen Bai family servants as well and took them away. In the distance, Bai Siwen's voice could be heard fading away. "I was just admiring this young lady! Admiring! Do you understand what admiring is? Not for a deep exchange... I am Bai Siwen! My ancestors shed blood at Yaishan! My father did business with the Great Song! I have bought many Australian goods, you can't do this to me..." Zhuo Yifan was secretly worried, but then he remembered what Li Xiaoliu had said: the 髡's police never "let a crime blossom." Even if there were some inquiries, as long as he was careful, he could probably get through it.

As he was thinking, he suddenly realized that the policewoman looked familiar. He thought back and immediately remembered: wasn't this the same policewoman who had beaten the arrogant servant at the inn entrance? Why was she in Nanbao?

At the time, he had only thought that this woman had a fiery temper. Today, seeing her step forward without hesitation, she had a rather chivalrous air. He couldn't help but feel a little more favorable towards her.

Zhuo Yifan followed the address on the letter and slowly made his way there. Fortunately, like East Gate Market, there were many street signs and signposts here. Following the signs, he soon found "Huang's Medical Shop."

This side street was relatively quiet, with few shops nearby. The sign of Huang's Medical Shop was very conspicuous. Zhuo Yifan walked over slowly and saw that the shop was still decorated in the old style: a wooden counter at the entrance, with rows of medicine drawers behind it. A wooden sign hung at the door, with the words: "Medical Institution Approved by the People's Committee of Health and the Health Police Department of the National Police." Below it was another line of words: "First-class, Grade A."

At the end of the shop was a curtained doorway—a sign outside read "Consultation Room." Below it were three more signs with the names Jiao Gongli, Song Shiying, and Zhou Zhongjun, which made Zhuo Yifan slightly surprised.

He knew all three of them, at least by sight. But seeing their names on the signs for practicing doctors was a bit comical. Especially Zhou Zhongjun—what kind of illness could she treat? She'd probably kill someone!

He looked at the two assistants behind the counter; they were strangers. Seeing him enter, an assistant had already come to greet him.

"What would you like to buy, sir?"

Zhuo Yifan took a step forward and asked, "Do you have schisandra berries?"

The assistant's expression changed. He couldn't help but lower his voice. "Yes, what kind of schisandra berries would you like, sir?"

Zhuo Yifan said in a clear voice, "Schisandra berries in the mouth, soothe the breath and calm the spirit. I want the kind that can be used to make wine."

The assistant's expression became even more solemn. He said in a low voice, "We don't have the kind for making wine at the moment. If you really need it, please go to the accounting room to speak with our shopkeeper."

"Alright, lead the way."

The accounting room was behind the counter, with a small, hidden door. Inside, he saw both Huang Zhen and Sima Qiudao. The three of them already knew each other, so there were no greetings or pleasantries. They just nodded slightly and sat down.

Huang Zhen coughed. "Since Young Master Zhuo has arrived..."

Before he could finish, Zhou Zhongjun's voice came from outside. "You're so stupid. I've told you so many times, the needles must be washed clean before being soaked in alcohol. You didn't even wash them, just soaked them like that! What if the 髡 find out?"

Huang Zhen and Sima Qiudao knew that she was scolding Nan Wan'er again. Since Zhou Zhongjun had also obtained a primary acupuncturist license, she had openly hung up her shingle and started practicing medicine. Nan Wan'er not only had to do the cooking and laundry, but also had to take on many miscellaneous tasks in the shop, which basically meant being Zhou Zhongjun's assistant.

Zhuo Yifan frowned slightly. Huang Zhen said, "It's nothing. The 髡 have many rules here, and it's very troublesome if you break them..."

Sima Qiudao said, "Although this is our shop, it's still a public place. It's not appropriate to just call them '髡' like that."

Huang Zhen smiled wryly. It was clear that he also had some complaints about Zhou Zhongjun.

Just as Zhuo Yifan was about to speak, there was another crash from outside, as if something had fallen to the ground, followed by Zhou Zhongjun's angry shout. "You've really learned something since you came out, haven't you? Learning to throw things!"

From the sound of it, Nan Wan'er was crying in distress, sobbing, "I didn't throw it. If you hadn't pushed me, it wouldn't have fallen..."

Before the people inside could react, the curtain was pulled aside with a swish. A "fake 髡" girl walked in. Her long hair was tied back with a ribbon, and a sparkling gem flower adorned her temple. She wore an apple-green dress with a small white collar that looked very refreshing. Over the dress, she wore a light blue long apron.

Zhuo Yifan was startled. He thought to himself, *How could the assistant outside be so careless as to let a fake 髡 just walk in?* He took a closer look and realized that it was Zhou Zhongjun.

It had only been a little over a month since they had parted in Guangzhou. How had this disciple of Abbess Miejing changed so much? She was dressed in the shameless attire of a fake 髡 girl. If the Abbess saw her, she would probably be half-dead with anger.

She came in without any greeting, just sat down with a huff, and said, "I can't do this anymore. I want to go back!"

She then began to list Nan Wan'er's various faults, from "clumsy" to "disobedient," and then to "lazy and unmotivated"... she went on and on for several minutes. From the looks of it, she really wanted to teach her senior sister a good lesson.

Just as she was getting worked up, she saw that Zhuo Yifan was also there and abruptly stopped speaking. "Young Master Zhuo is here too."

Zhuo Yifan nodded and said with a smile, "I just arrived not long ago." He then looked her up and down.

Zhou Zhongjun blushed slightly and smiled humbly. "I lost my composure just now. I've made a fool of myself in front of you, Young Master Zhuo."

Zhuo Yifan said, "Miss Zhou is straightforward and speaks her mind. Although her words may lack gentleness, they are all from a sincere and good heart. We all understand." He changed the subject. "However, we are now in a den of dragons and tigers. We have all come here with the utmost sincerity, to repay the kindness of the court and to relieve the suffering of the people. In our daily interactions, it is best to be harmonious. Even if there are some faults, we should still inform each other gently. As the saying goes, haste makes waste. We must not hurt our harmony. And just now, you used the word '髡' so casually. If someone were to hear it, it would be very inappropriate."

Sima Qiudao secretly nodded. *This Young Master Zhuo has some sense of responsibility. If it were a slippery and worldly person like Huang Zhen, he would naturally pretend to be deaf and dumb about such internal affairs of the Hengshan Sect. Although Zhuo Yifan's words were tactful, he had pointed out Zhou Zhongjun's faults. He had wrapped a great principle in a small personal favor, both admonishing Zhou Zhongjun and taking care of Nan Wan'er. It was very fair, a truly golden piece of advice.*

Whether it was because of his words or some other reason, Zhou Zhongjun had lost her earlier vigor. She sat with her head bowed, her face slightly flushed, looking like a shy young girl. She said in a low voice, "Young Master Zhuo is right. I was too impatient."

Huang Zhen cursed inwardly. *Damn it, what golden advice? It's all about the face! I've said those things too, and all I got was a white eye and a 'humph.'*

The four of them had their own thoughts. Zhuo Yifan said, "Since Miss Zhou is here, let's discuss the next steps together."

Zhou Zhongjun quickly said, "I'm on duty today. If a patient asks for me and I'm not there, it won't look good. I'll go out and see patients first." With that, she stood up and left. Although she was arrogant, she knew her own place. The three men present were the leaders of the operation. How could she participate in the meeting? If word got out, it would make the Hengshan Sect look very undisciplined. It wasn't that she didn't understand human relationships; she just didn't think it was necessary to use them on a "servant" like Nan Wan'er.

Huang Zhen first reported on the recent situation. Since he had "flirted with the female manager," although he had remained "steadfast and unyielding" and had not crossed the "final line," he had to play along with You Xiu, and there had been some affectionate moments.

Under You Xiu's "intimate guidance," the Huang family's pharmacy had opened smoothly. The certification process had also gone smoothly. Jiao Gongli and Song Shiying had obtained licenses for bone-setting and massage, while Zhou Zhongjun had obtained a license for acupuncture. Zhou Zhongjun's performance in the exam was excellent. The chief examiner, knowing that she was literate, even suggested that she take the B-level literacy exam, go to New Lingao for a crash course, and take the proper traditional Chinese physician's license exam.

So the three of them began to practice medicine here, and business was surprisingly good. The medicines were procured from Runshitang, both sliced herbs and prepared medicines. However, it was difficult to get prepared medicines—they were too popular. So they simply prepared some commonly used medicines themselves. Jiao Gongli and Song Shiying had several proven formulas for treating bruises and injuries, which they made into several kinds of pills and ointments. Unexpectedly, they sold out as soon as they were launched. The local economy was dominated by mining, and many people suffered from musculoskeletal injuries due to heavy physical labor. The demand for their medicines exceeded the supply. Not only did the naturalized citizens and natives come to buy them, but even the Li people came to buy them. The Huang family's pharmacy quickly became famous, and their consultation business also flourished.

After a month of operation, Huang Zhen checked the accounts. After deducting daily expenses and taxes, the net profit surprised even himself. At this rate, he would be able to recoup his investment in less than half a year. Where in the world was there such a profitable business? This Lingao was truly prosperous!

Pharmacies were already a highly profitable industry in the Great Ming, but this was on the premise that you could have enough customers. Ordinary poor people who got sick could only resign themselves to their fate or drink a bowl of incense ash. They would not spend money to see a doctor and buy medicine. The Huashan Sect also had some pharmacies in its properties. In recent years, the people in Shaanxi and Shanxi had become increasingly poor. The middle-class and wealthy families who could afford medicine had either been killed, gone bankrupt, or fled to relatively safe large counties. The pharmacy business was getting worse and worse, and some places could no longer be sustained.
