The sun rose, and Wen Desi stood on the aftcastle of the gunboat, his hands clasped behind his back. A golden layer of morning sun enveloped him, making him radiate a dazzling light. The native naval officers and men stood by respectfully, not daring to utter a sound. President Wen gazed at Guangzhou, his heart filled with the heroic sentiment of "having looked at the Wu hook sword, patted every railing, with no one to understand my ambition."

"Back to the place where we once fought," Wen Desi murmured. He thought of the time when he, Wang, and Xiao traveled back and forth through the wormhole, raising funds. The memory of being rescued by Ran Yao and his men with a few small-caliber rifles and shotguns at Bai'e Tan, and their subsequent hasty retreat, was still vivid.

Now, he was leading a fleet here. The lives and property of the entire city's officials and people were at his mercy. The feeling of triumph was palpable.

"In the beginning, my team was just starting out, with only a dozen men and seven or eight guns..." Wen Desi suddenly hummed a line from a Beijing opera he wasn't very familiar with. At this moment, nothing could express his feelings better than this line.

Chen Haiyang was originally below the aftcastle. Not wanting to disturb President Wen's mood, he had not approached. Unlike Wen Desi's flood of emotions, he was considering the next step.

The war had reached a point where it had transcended the military sphere and become a political one. The task force had fought its way to Guangzhou not to capture this major East Asian city, but to force the other side to sue for peace. How to apply just the right amount of pressure to achieve their goal without pushing the other side to a desperate, all-or-nothing fight required very precise judgment.

"President Wen," Chen Haiyang called out when Wen Desi's reminiscing seemed to fade. "What do you think we should do next?"

The Senate had no intention of occupying Guangzhou. They wanted to reopen trade and continue to obtain manpower, resources, and a market from Guangdong. To do this, they couldn't scare away Guangzhou's wealthy merchants. According to the Intelligence Bureau's reports, many wealthy merchants had already fled Guangzhou. If they actually captured the city, the entire Pearl River Delta would become a "war zone." Merchants would not dare to come, and occupying the city would be meaningless.

Wen Desi and Chen Haiyang had been racking their brains all along the way, trying to figure out how to make a big splash without completely closing the door to negotiations with the Guangdong authorities.

Now that the warships had reached Bai'e Tan, peace talks needed to begin as soon as possible. Although the Pearl River Estuary expedition had been a great success, if it failed to achieve peace, it would be a complete strategic failure.

Chen Haiyang suggested immediately sending someone into Guangzhou to deliver a note, demanding that the city's officials come out to negotiate.

"No, we can't use a formal note for this. Wouldn't that imply a 'two-states theory'? Li Fengjie wouldn't dare to accept such a note," Wen Desi shook his head repeatedly. "We can only pass messages through private contacts! The officials have their own ways of dealing with their superiors. We need to find a channel of communication quickly."

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau had Lin Baiguang and others undercover in Guangzhou, so the task force received daily telegrams from the Lingao central station about the situation in the city.

"Li Fengjie has tried to contact Gao Ju several times, but Gao Ju has always refused. I think we can have the Intelligence Bureau contact Gao Ju now and have him act as the middleman," Wen Desi said. "Gao Ju has always been an agent for Australian goods. He can't shed that identity. It's reasonable for him to step forward."

"Let's fire a few blank shots first to scare them," Chen Haiyang said. "I don't believe the officials in the city can play deaf and dumb."

Gao Ju had closed his doors to visitors, claiming to be "not at home" to anyone who came to see him. This was not an act of arrogance, but because his position was awkward and it was difficult for him to face various parties.

After Guo Yi and the others fled and the Zi-brand businesses were successively seized, Gao Ju felt he had lost a great deal of face. He had written a rather displeased letter to Eunuch Yang, reporting the incident. Of course, Eunuch Yang had little influence in the palace now, but a centipede dies but never falls down. He still had his connections, and if he found an opportunity, he might be able to cause some serious trouble for the Tian family.

After the defeat at Chengmai, some gentry and officials secretly tried to persuade him to mediate for peace. On one hand, he resented the government for causing him to lose face and credibility over the Zi-brand businesses. On the other hand, he didn't know how deep the waters were and didn't dare to get involved rashly. He simply claimed to be "not at home" and stayed in his residence, observing the situation.

Though he didn't leave his house, he was well-informed about the outside world. He knew all about the "exploits" of the task force as it entered the Pearl River, which made him both surprised and delighted. He was surprised by the Australians' strength—not only had they defeated the government's punitive expedition, but they had also pursued them into the inner rivers of the Pearl River, their forces pointing directly at Guangzhou. If a major battle broke out under the city walls, this "paradise" for businessmen would be destroyed. He was delighted because he had managed to stay on the right side during this "encircle and suppress the Kun" test. He had handled both the government and the Australians passably. When the Australians returned, the Gao family could continue to profit from Australian goods.

As the Australians drew closer to Guangzhou and their power grew, he fully understood their intentions—they were "using war to force peace."

Since "peace" was the goal, there had to be a channel of communication. Gao Ju considered himself the most suitable person in all of Guangdong for this role. Both the government and the Australians would have to seek him out to mediate if they wanted to negotiate.

So, for the past month, he had resumed his normal "at home" status, though he rarely saw guests and didn't talk much when he did. He was "waiting for the right price," preparing to fleece the government and the local gentry, and if possible, the Australians as well.

Gao Ju paid close attention to every move outside. As the Australian fleet pressed closer, the city grew increasingly tense, and the wealthy began to flee, he remained unmoved. He had a hunch that the Australians would not attack Guangzhou; at most, they would just make a show of force outside the city.

He had already made up his mind. He would only step forward when the government officials came to his door again to ask him to negotiate. Of course, they would have to agree to a series of conditions first. He wanted to regain his face, and also the Australians' face—and, of course, to vent his anger. The thought of Tian Da's insolent and arrogant behavior in his presence made his blood boil.

That day, he had just gotten up and had breakfast alone. He went to the courtyard where he conducted his business and first amused himself with his birds. Gao Ju loved raising birds. Unlike the northern style, which valued the birds' song, he prioritized their beautiful appearance and colorful feathers. He had collected many rare and precious birds from various Western countries, which were not seen in China. They were a beautiful sight, hanging in their cages under the eaves.

In the midst of this harmonious scene, a loud rumbling of cannons suddenly came from outside. The small birds were startled and fluttered wildly in their cages. Gao Ju frowned and looked in the direction of the sound—it was coming from Bai'e Tan.

Bai'e Tan was a place of flower boats and restaurants. Where did the cannons come from? Had the Australians already reached Bai'e Tan? As Gao Ju was wondering, a servant rushed in and reported, "The Australian fleet has reached Bai'e Tan and is firing blank shots."

"Let them fire," Gao Ju said with an air of indifference. It was just a tactic to scare them.

"Master," the servant said hesitantly, "Master Tian is here to pay a visit..."

"Which Master Tian?"

"Tian Da—"

Gao Ju snorted. "Not at home." He couldn't be bothered to see this despicable person.

"He refuses to leave and insists on seeing you," the servant did not leave as usual but continued to plead. "He says he has a great fortune to offer you."

"I won't see him," Gao Ju said flatly. He then glanced at the servant mockingly. "How much silver did you get from him?"

"I didn't..." the servant said in alarm, quickly trying to defend himself.

"Go to the accounting office and tell them I said to give you eight taels of silver. And throw Tian Da's four taels back at him!" Gao Ju said with a blank expression.

"I dare not, I dare not," the servant said, terrified. He knelt and kowtowed. "I know I was wrong..."

"Go."

He didn't know why Tian Da was so desperate to see him, but he could guess. Tian Da's attempt to take over the Zi-brand businesses in Guangzhou had been a complete failure. First, the Guo masters and others had mysteriously disappeared. That was still manageable, as Tian Da could at least get the properties left behind by the Zi-brand. But the government had dragged its feet, and after the news of the disastrous defeat at Chengmai arrived, even outsiders knew Tian Da had no hope.

Tian Da had been in Guangzhou for almost a year. He had originally boasted that he could get the Guangzhou Zi-brand businesses to pledge allegiance to his master, but now he had nothing to show for it. If he returned empty-handed, his time as a servant of the Tian family would likely be over. Recently, he had been collecting all sorts of Australian goods and treasures, probably to have something to show when he returned.

Tian Da was turned away at Gao Ju's residence. The doorman, who had previously been all smiles after taking his silver and promising "it's on me," now had a cold face. He simply threw the silver back at him, said, "Not at home," and refused to speak further.

Tian Da cursed, "Damn it, all of you have grown some balls!" He couldn't stay in Guangzhou any longer. These officials and gentry turned face faster than flipping a book. Before, whenever he paid a visit, no one dared not to see him. At the very least, they would come out to greet him and give him a few dozen taels of silver for his expenses. Now, no one with any background would see him. Even those who did were extremely rude, let alone offering him any gifts.

The Zi-brand was a lost cause. When the yamen runners had sealed the properties after the Australians fled, Tian Da had easily gotten them to let him in for a "tour." But he was disappointed. There were plenty of goods and equipment left behind, but they had all been confiscated by the runners. The Australian businesses had a lot of common tools, but also a few Australian machines of unknown use. The exquisite copper and glass parts on them had either been stolen by the runners or damaged by their rough handling during the seizure. Without Australian craftsmen, they were impossible to repair or use. He had also learned that the owners had left in a very orderly fashion, without leaving behind a single piece of paper.

Not only had he failed to get his hands on these businesses, but even if he had, they would have been useless! Unless a buyer was willing to take them over. But who had the ability to revive these businesses? The things they sold were all Australian goods, or at least made with Australian secret recipes. For example, no one in all of Guangzhou knew how to make the fizzy, sweet water that tingled in the mouth. And the ice cubes that could be produced at any time, even in the middle of summer...

"Gao Ju, that damned old fox," Tian Da cursed as he came out. He had sought out Gao Ju to try and extort some rare Australian goods from him to take back as a consolation prize, since his attempt to seize the Zhiming Tower had failed. With the Kun thieves pressing closer, Tian Da had a bad feeling and had long been thinking of returning north.

But Gao Ju was unyielding and held him in contempt. He had originally wanted to get his hands on the Australian lamp that could shine so brightly to present to the palace, but now the man wouldn't even see him, which made Tian Da feel he had lost a great deal of face.

"To the Liu family," Tian Da decided after getting into his sedan chair. The Liu family were merchants with no power, and they did business with the north. It was said they had a few rare Australian treasures. This family had deep ties with the Australians; he was not afraid they would not submit. After he got what he wanted, he would leave Guangzhou immediately. He had heard the cannons at Bai'e Tan. He had to slip away while the city gates were still open. If he fell into the hands of the Australians, he would surely suffer.

As the sedan chair was being carried through the streets, Tian Da was plotting how to properly extort the Liu family when someone suddenly shouted, "A bull has gone mad, run!"

Tian Da was about to stick his head out to see when the sedan chair fell to the ground with a bang, nearly throwing him out. Tian Da cursed, "You bunch of dogs! You can't even carry a sedan chair..."

The bearers had already fled. Tian Da had just stuck his head out the window when he saw a massive water buffalo, snorting and panting, charging straight at the sedan chair with its huge horns.

Tian Da screamed and collapsed inside the chair.

A crisp "crack" of breaking bone was the last sound Tian Da heard in this world.

Tian Da's death caused not a single ripple in Guangzhou city—except among those who knew of his feud with the Australians. Those who had once flattered him felt extremely guilty, while those who had suffered at his hands secretly rejoiced. When Gao Ju heard the news, he only smiled faintly.

While the drama was unfolding in the city, the task force outside was not idle. The Fubo Army landed at Bai'e Tan, requisitioning several restaurants as headquarters and senior officer quarters. A temporary naval pier was built on the jetties where the flower boats used to dock. Many rocket launchers and Hale rockets were unloaded from the ships and set up outside the city. If the officials in the city still lacked a sense of urgency about peace talks, Wen Desi was prepared to remind them with rockets.

To facilitate the bombardment of Guangzhou from all directions, all the mortar boats of the mortar boat squadron were temporarily refitted. The 280mm mortars were removed and replaced with rocket launchers. This way, the mortar boats could maneuver along Bai'e Tan and the inner river channels to bombard Guangzhou from any direction.

The Hale rocket fleet, transported from Hong Kong, had brought over three hundred rockets. Wen Desi decided to give Li Fengjie three days. If there was no response, he would give them a grand fireworks display.

An elder suggested using the intelligence network within the city to send a "connection" to ask Gao Ju to propose peace talks to Li Fengjie.

"It's better to let the other side propose peace talks first. Besides, if we ask Gao Ju, he will become arrogant and will inevitably use this to claim credit and demand greater benefits from us in the future," Wen Desi said. "Let's wait a few days and see their reaction."

To avoid being attacked from both front and rear, Chen Haiyang ordered a mixed battalion of marines and sailors, with artillery, to drive out the garrisons at the key points of Fenghuang Gang to the west of Guangzhou and Dongsheng Temple to the east. It took less than a day to clear the enemy. The garrisons at both locations fled after brief resistance, leaving behind 90 bodies and over 200 old, miscellaneous cannons. The Fubo Army suffered 10 casualties, including 3 killed.

The fall of Fenghuang Gang and Dongsheng Temple put Guangzhou in an even more passive defensive position. Li Fengjie had no choice but to make up his mind about the peace talks he had been dithering on.

Li Fengjie thought that the biggest obstacle to peace talks was Gao Shunqin. If he found out, he would surely oppose it with all his might, and might even immediately submit a memorial to impeach him. As a censor, he could report on "hearsay," putting anything he heard into a memorial. If public opinion in the capital was stirred up, he would be in deep trouble.

After much consideration, he decided, as usual, not to appear in person and to proceed on two fronts. The matters in Guangzhou would be handled directly by the Guangzhou Prefect, Yu Baocun. After all, as the one responsible for defending the territory, Yu Baocun was the first in line and would not refuse.

The other front would be handled by Li Luoyou in Macau. Macau was Portuguese territory, so the two sides could talk openly. Things that could only be hinted at to Yu Baocun could be discussed plainly with Li Luoyou.

For now, the priority was to have Yu Baocun and Gao Ju persuade the Australians to withdraw their troops. Then they could discuss other conditions in Macau. Every extra day the Australian warships stayed here made it harder for him to explain to the court.

Yu Baocun went to the governor's yamen and had a secret meeting that lasted half the night. The next morning, he personally went in his sedan chair to see Gao Ju.

"Is this the governor's intention?" Gao Ju asked after hearing Yu Baocun's request for him to negotiate the withdrawal of the "Kun thieves."

"Your Excellency Gao, you are wise. Do I need to spell it out for you?" Yu Baocun said with a bitter smile. "We are all responsible for defending our territory and have no choice. We must rely on you for this matter."

"What are you saying, my lord," Gao Ju said with an air of indifference. "I am but a humble merchant. I'm afraid I am not up to this task."

Yu Baocun cursed the old fox inwardly for his pretense. He was surely going to ask for an exorbitant price. But since he needed his help now, he could only signal that as long as he was willing to step forward, everything was negotiable.
