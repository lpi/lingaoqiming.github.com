The agenda moved to machinery, [Chief Wen][y002]'s area of expertise. The discussion centered on what equipment to bring. [Zhan Wuya][y004] had already contributed his small factory, and he listed its equipment.

"Can this equipment produce the specialized machinery we need? Boilers, for example?"

"Theoretically, yes," [Zhan Wuya][y004] said, scratching his head. He was not used to being the center of attention. "My factory mainly processes parts for other companies. We haven't made any complex machinery. And there are some small parts we don't make, like standard partsâ€”screws, bolts, washers, that sort of thing. It's best to use specialized equipment for those."

"Of course, we can make them, but it's more trouble. We could build specialized machines to make them.

"Then there are castings, gears, bearings... a small factory like mine can't make those. It requires specialized equipment, heat treatment, electroplating... I don't know much about that. We usually just buy them or have someone else process them."

"But gears and bearings are essential. Without them, we can't have a manufacturing industry."

"Then let's bring specialized equipment. A gear hobbing machine for gears. Bearings are more difficult..."

"A full set of equipment for a bearing factory would cost over ten million."

"Ten million is a small matter. Where are you going to find the skilled workers?"

"We'll have to start with indigenous methods. Try to rely on existing equipment as much as possible."

"The materials require a heat treatment furnace. The bearing cages and balls can be done by hand. A punch press for fixing."

...

The discussion grew more complex. After a while, the Industrial Group reached a consensus on the manufacturing of gears and bearings. Someone started writing a list.

"I propose we don't bring shearing and bending machines," [Wen Desi][y002] said. "A few more punch presses can do the same job. We should bring as many cutting tools and grinding wheels as possible. And the factory needs a milling machine and a heat treatment furnace."

"If we want to be as complete as possible, we also need a broaching machine and a boring machine," said Jiang Ye, an eight-year veteran lathe operator. "And more lathes. The lathe is the most basic machining tool."

"How about eight lathes?"

"Too few. Let's make it twelve. They're very useful."

"What about a forging press? We'll need one of those too."

...

As the machinery discussion dragged on, many began to yawn. But the rules forbade them from leaving, so they began to have their own small group discussions, and the room filled with a low buzz.

"We also need a small foundry," [Wang Luobin][y003] said, ignoring the moderator. "We'll need to build engines in the future. The single-cylinder diesel engine is a universal machine: it can plow fields, power boats, generate electricity, and transport people and goods."

"A small engine is not a big problem. A general agricultural single-cylinder engine can be made of cast iron."

"Speaking of casting, I thought of the problem of mold making. It's a professional trade. You need molds to make good products. And the modern mold industry is... heaven-defying. 3D modeling, electrical discharge machining..."

"It's not that exaggerated. In the past, the process designer would draw the mold, the parts would be machined, and then assembled by fitters. The skill of the fitters was key."

...

Slowly, the machinery discussion wound down. The Industrial Group had used up a lot of paper, and seemed confident. [Wen Desi][y002], watching [Engineer Wang][y003] scribbling furiously, worried about the length of the procurement list.

"I am [Ji Situi][y044]," a man with a full beard and a baby face said, standing up. "On behalf of the Chemical Group, I express my strong protest." He emphasized the words "Chemical Group." "The chemical industry is a very important sector. How can it be lumped in with the Industrial Group? They are all in machinery, and have nothing to do with us!"

"We'll discuss the grouping later. First, let's hear your views on the chemical industry."

"Three acids and two alkalis. That is our goal.

"Let me first popularize some basic chemical knowledge. We are talking about heavy chemical industry, the foundation of all chemical industries."

Now it was the machinery personnel's turn to yawn.

"The chemical industry is the most versatile of all industrial fields. Its products are rarely end products. They are used by other industries. Sulfuric acid for fertilizer, soda ash for glass, synthetic ammonia for explosives and fertilizer. If we can solve the manufacturing of these basic chemicals, we can solve many material manufacturing problems.

"Do you know how much you rely on the chemical industry in your daily life? You don't, which is why you lump us in with machinery!" He shook his head. "A tragedy!"

"Don't get so emotional. Just talk about the chemical industry."

"We need a set of synthetic ammonia and combined soda production systems, and a set of coking chemical systems. That will meet our basic needs, especially the synthetic ammonia equipment."

"What is coking equipment?"

"A coke oven?"

"No. Simply put, it's a combined manufacturing system that uses coal tar to produce various chemicals. It can produce sulfuric acid, phenol, nitric acid, dyes, and yes, sulfa drugs."

"Sulfa drugs are very useful. We'll have antibiotics."

"The output is not very high, but it's generally sufficient."

"What about synthetic ammonia? For fertilizer?"

"It is extremely useful. Without it, we cannot produce nitric acid."

"And without nitric acid, we cannot produce explosives."

"And of course, the fertilizer industry is even more dependent on it."

"In addition to the complete sets of equipment, we also need various towers, kettles, pipelines, pumps, heaters... I think we'll need at least 500-600 tons of materials."

"Can't we produce these ourselves? Our machinery industry is relatively complete."

"It's a materials problem," [Ji Situi][y044] said. "Unless we can quickly produce stainless steel and polyethylene, it will be difficult to produce chemical equipment ourselves within ten years."

"What about using glass and ceramics?" [Luo Duo][y011] asked. "The Eighth Route Army's military industry used water vats as reaction towers to make sulfuric acid. And the indigenous chemical equipment from the Great Leap Forward also used these things."

"I'm not clear about that. If we can purchase modern equipment, there is no need to use indigenous methods. The production efficiency will be much higher. And the production environment is better. If any of you want to make sulfuric acid in a water vat, you'd better think carefully about your teeth."

"I would like to ask, after we have this equipment, can we establish an organic chemical industry?"

"That, I'm afraid, will be very difficult," [Ji Situi][y044] said, thinking, *You guys are really asking for the moon.*

"Then we won't be able to produce nylon and synthetic rubber," someone lamented.

"What do you need nylon for, stockings?" someone joked.

"Black silk, flesh-colored silk... not a single one can be missing."

As the atmosphere began to devolve into farce, [Xiao Zishan][y001] had to intervene.

"You want organic chemistry for plastics, right?" [Ji Situi][y044] asked the man who had proposed it. The man nodded. "Plastic is our most common daily necessity, but the organic chemistry involved is very complex. It's unlikely we can make it. But we can manufacture celluloid and Bakelite."

"Bakelite is very useful."

"If we want to build an electrical power system, Bakelite is very useful, but rubber is also..."

"Regarding the discussion on rubber, let's have the Agriculture Group elaborate on it later."
