In the third round, the pace of both fighters quickened significantly, and their movement radius also expanded. The two moved back and forth across the field with large strides, the offense and defense alternating between them. The two wooden rifles clashed violently, the shouts of "kill" rising one after another, a true tit-for-tat. Everyone could feel that Huang Xiong had increased the rhythm and intensity of his attack, forcing Fu Fu to retreat towards the side where the spectators were. It looked like Fu Fu was about to step on the watching soldiers.

"Make way, make way," someone in the back reminded and shifted their position. Suddenly, a "crack" sounded from behind them, like a clap of thunder. Looking back, they saw Fu Fu standing at the edge of the field in the position of attention, holding his rifle. Huang Xiong was sitting on the ground, his hands still tightly gripping his wooden rifle, but the tip was gone. The tip, over a foot long, was on the ground.

Another huge round of applause.

The competition was over. Both fighters took off their head protectors. They looked as if they had just climbed out of the sea, their heads covered in sweat. The collars of their protective gear were all wet, and they both kept wiping their eyes with their fingers. Under the near-noon sun, Fu Fu closed his eyes, his face turned towards the sky, beaming with a silly smile.

The overall result of the competition was a victory for the 1st Battalion. The companies reassembled and began their mountain training march. The sea breeze blew gently, fluttering the flags, accompanied by the song "Bayonet Charge."

> Bayonet charge!
> Anger burns in our chests,
> The order to advance starts a storm,
> We stand at the very front.
> Our hatred is deep,
> Our consciousness is high,
> If the usurper Ming dares to obstruct,
> Give them a bayonet!
>
> Bayonet charge!
> Anger burns in our chests,
> The cold steel of our rifles forged by workers and peasants,
> Obeying the teachings of the Senate.
> Stab the old Chongzhen,
> Uproot the poisonous weeds,
> Aim at the pigskin Huang Taiji,
> Give him a bayonet!
>
> Kill!

> Bayonet charge!
> Anger burns in our chests,

> The savage, feudal reactionaries
> Fear this move the most.

Guangzhou City.

In a high-class private room at the Zimming Building, the "private performance" had just ended. A half-naked Persian dancer bowed gracefully and was about to come down to pour wine. Ren Fu waved his hand gently. The dancer knew the two gentlemen had matters to discuss, so she curtsied again, put on her cloak, and withdrew.

In the private room, the sound of silk and bamboo instruments drifted from somewhere, complementing the sunless yet luxuriously decorated environment and the sweet scent of fruit... creating a dreamlike sense of intoxication.

On a large, soft sofa, a middle-aged man was leaning back with his limbs spread out. Although he was in such a place of debauchery, there was not much enjoyment on his face.

His clothes were neither expensive nor cheap. He was well-built and had an imposing air, not like a scholar, farmer, artisan, or merchant, but a warrior.

Ren Fu, all smiles, picked up the wine pot and poured him a drink. "General Liu, about the matter I mentioned to you last time, you have to give me an answer, whether it's a yes or a no."

The man called General Liu did not take the wine cup. He took a deep breath. "This matter... can we wait and see?"

"Listen to you," Ren Fu said with a fawning smile, looking like a professional sycophant who had long frequented such establishments. "This isn't you choosing a girl, where you can wait and see. This is a matter of military and state importance, it can't wait..."

General Liu was a little angry. "I also know this is a matter of military and state importance, a matter of losing one's head! That's why I said wait and see, wait and see."

Ren Fu was still all smiles. "Look, I dare not say what the general situation of the world is, but everyone can see clearly the situation here in Guangdong. You, sir, have been the gatekeeper at Humen for these past few years, and the Australians have not been stingy with their benefits to you—in fact, you know very well that they don't have to give them, right?"

This General Liu was the chiliarch of Humen Fort. Since the Fubo Army broke through Humen and burned down the Wuyang Post Station in the Guangzhou campaign, the defense system along the Pearl River estuary had basically collapsed. After Xiong Wencan took office, he cast cannons, built ships, and recruited soldiers. He rebuilt the Humen Fort and some of the forts destroyed by the Fubo Army, barely re-establishing the defense system from the Pearl River estuary to the Bai'etan.

However, this defense system was completely open to the Australians. After the fire of the Pearl River estuary breakthrough, the local officials, gentry, and soldiers all knew that no matter how they defended, they were nothing but clay and paper in front of the Australians. Ships flying the Senate's flag sailed openly on the Pearl River, and no warship or sentry post dared to intercept or inspect them. At first, it was only cargo ships and merchant ships, then patrol boats also openly sailed up to Bai'etan. As the commander of Humen Fort for several years, Chiliarch Liu was well aware of this.

Seeing his silence, Ren Fu said softly, "General, a wise man submits to circumstances."

Chiliarch Liu said with difficulty, "Brother Ren! It's not that I don't know how to submit to circumstances, it's just that this matter is too big! This... this... is... treason..." When he said the word "treason," he couldn't help but lower his voice. "I still have a family. What if..."

He pondered for a moment and said, "How about this? You go back and tell the Australians that it's impossible for me to openly join them. But whatever the Australians do on the Pearl River, I'll pretend I didn't see anything. I'll close the camp gate and not a single soldier will come out. What do you think?"

Ren Fu sneered. "General Liu, your calculation is too optimistic. Just take your Humen Fort, can it withstand the Australians' cannons? To be honest, if you don't join them, the Australians will just have to spend a little more on cannonballs and gunpowder. The opportunity to abandon the darkness and join the light is only offered once. You shouldn't miss it..."

Chiliarch Liu thought for a moment and gritted his teeth. "Alright, I'll join! It seems the Ming Dynasty's days are numbered!"

"Now that's a wise man," Ren Fu said, raising his wine cup. "I toast General Liu!"

The two drained their cups. Chiliarch Liu frowned. "It's just that there are several hundred men in Humen Fort. The soldiers are not a problem, as long as there's pay! But there are a few centurions who are tricky."

Ren Fu knew he was now negotiating terms. He thought for a moment and said, "How much military pay does your fort owe?"

"We haven't received full pay for half a year. In total, we've only received one and a half months' pay."

Chiliarch Liu was actually hiding something. In fact, three months' pay had been issued, but he had taken half for himself. Of the remaining one and a half months' pay, after various deductions, most of the men, except for the officers and his personal retainers, had at most received one month's pay.

"Pay is not a problem," Ren Fu said magnanimously. "The Australians are the richest. Are you afraid they can't pay? When the time comes, there will probably be rewards. What's the difficulty with the few centurions?"

General Liu said, "The others are easy to deal with, but two of them are of Tartar official descent. They are a bit tricky."

These few Tartar centurions were Mongolian and Hui soldiers who had surrendered to the Ming from the Yuan Dynasty. These people had lived in Guangzhou for generations since the Yuan Dynasty and could be considered old Guangzhou hands, loyal to the Ming. Due to their background, the Tartar officials always stuck together and were local powers. They were a major force in Humen Fort and did not fully respect Chiliarch Liu, an outsider. He thought that if he really wanted to rise up, these people would definitely not agree. They had their own personal soldiers, and many of the camp soldiers were also from the local garrisons and were connected. If these few people raised their arms and shouted, his own personal soldiers might not be able to suppress them.

Ren Fu smiled sinisterly. "General Liu is also a warrior who has fought his way up. For those who are willing to follow you, the Australians will not be stingy with their benefits. As for those who are unwilling, there is naturally a place for them to go."

"What place?" Chiliarch Liu's mind didn't turn fast enough.

"A Hongmen Banquet!" Ren Fu said viciously. "When the time comes, General Liu, don't be like Xiang Yu!"

Chiliarch Liu nodded silently, seemingly calculating something. He then said, "But the men under them are not easy to handle either. They are all from the same neighborhood, and some are even relatives..."

"That's where your skills come in, General Liu," Ren Fu nodded. "If the Australians have to do everything for you, how can you show your merit?"

Chiliarch Liu gritted his teeth and nodded. "I understand! You are right, Master Ren!" He then said, "But what will be the signal? There must be a sign, otherwise, it would be bad if there was friendly fire."

"The warships will fly a five-colored flag as a sign. As soon as you see the five-colored flag, you can make your move!" Ren Fu said. "At that time, you will hang a blue flag on your fort. When the Fubo Army sees it, they will naturally send someone to contact you."

"A blue flag," Chiliarch Liu摸着脑袋, "I don't have one. I'll have someone get a batch of blue cloth..."

"No need to go to such trouble," Ren Fu said, pouring him another drink. "The blue flag has already been prepared in your camp. When the time comes, you just need to give the order and announce your defection. Someone will naturally present the flag. You just need to sit back and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Hahaha."

Chiliarch Liu also laughed dryly a few times, his back already soaked in sweat. If he had wanted to be a traitor or failed to act when he saw the signal, the person presenting the blue flag would be the one to take his head.

The thought of betraying the Ming made this soldier's heart quite conflicted. He had also earned his official hat by fighting the Eight-Row Yao, one sword and one spear at a time. To just throw away his Ming official title and become an Australian official, he felt a little regretful.

But the Ming Dynasty's days were numbered, and it was in imminent danger. Everyone could see that. These Australians were rich and could fight. Back then, General He had attacked them with the full force of the province, but not only was he defeated, he also provoked the Australians to advance on Guangzhou, and finally had to sue for peace to make them retreat. It was already very clear who was stronger and who was weaker. If he insisted on opposing the Australians, it would be like a praying mantis trying to stop a chariot, and there would be no good end. But if he "surrendered to the髡," he didn't know what his future would be. He had heard that their rules were different from the Ming...

While he was struggling, Ren Fu took out a piece of paper from his pocket and stuffed it into his hand. "Take this. This is some drinking money for your retainers from the Australians."

Chiliarch Liu didn't need to look. Just from the texture and size of the paper, he knew it was a Delong bank draft. He glanced at it: it was a considerable sum. His conflicted feelings were instantly swept away. He said in a low voice, "I am willing to serve the Senate like a dog or a horse."

Ren Fu smiled. "Good, good!" He was in high spirits and clapped his hands. He said to the attendant who came in to serve, "Go and call ten of your best foreign girls for General Liu to choose from. Put it on my tab."
