Mu Min took the document. It listed the identified foods: dairy products, mutton, bananas, nougat, mangoes... Alcohol was also detected.

Although Mu Min didn't know the menu at the maid school, she was well aware that this involved several "specially supplied foods" that only transmigrators could enjoy. Of course, as long as they were willing to pay, naturalized citizens and natives in Lingao could also buy them from the cooperative stores, but a student at the maid school, with only a meager allowance, could not afford these foods.

"So, Lin Xiaoya's last meal was with a certain transmigrator."

"Bingo!" Su Wan unconsciously used one of Cheng Yongxin's catchphrases, which made Mu Min give her a surprised look.

"Most transmigrators eat very simply on a daily basis, not particularly lavishly. From the list of stomach contents, you can see that this meal was rich in variety, with many high-end foods, and even alcoholic beverages. It's a bit like a sumptuous feast before the 'first time' in bed."

Mu Min now fully understood why Su Wan had been so hesitant and had written two autopsy reports. Even without knowing the investigation materials she currently possessed, just from the existing autopsy materials, it was clear that a transmigrator was involved.

Since the matter involved a transmigrator, her cautious attitude was understandable.

"Can I have your second report?"

"Of course, if you want it. I can sign it and give it to you right away. But before that, I'd like to hear the results of your investigation. Today is September 12th, more than ten days since the incident. I've been wanting to know who killed this poor girl and why. You're only now coming to question my autopsy report, so you must have a good idea of what happened."

"Since you were so cautious and prepared two reports, why are you suddenly interested in the truth?"

"Just as you said: finding out the truth is the most important thing," Su Wan said with a strange smile.

"Alright." Mu Min nodded. "I wasn't at the scene on the day the body was discovered. I only received the order to return to Lingao that night."

***

On September 1st, all senior transmigrator police officers were out of town conducting police administration research to pave the way for the next phase of police administration promotion. After receiving a call from the Executive Committee, Ran Yao immediately assigned Mu Min, who was in Qiongshan for research, to return to Lingao to take charge of the investigation.

Mu Min returned to Lingao overnight and studied the case file from the scene investigation that day. The scene investigation materials were too brief. Although her star pupil, Wu Xiang, had gone to the scene, she knew his capabilities.

Furthermore, as a naturalized citizen police officer, it was too inconvenient to investigate such a case. Some necessary procedures had not been followed. Mu Min decided: time was of the essence, she would go to the scene to investigate at dawn.

However, she had been on a business trip to Chengmai and Qiongshan for more than half a month to research police administration and had not returned to Lingao. This time, she received a new task immediately upon her return. It seemed the case would not be closed for another seven or eight days. She should inform her husband first.

She picked up her PHS and dialed Ming Lang's number.

After the call, she took a short nap. After dawn, she requested a public service carriage and went to the transmigrator residential area in Bairen City.

The road to the transmigrator residential area was shaded by green trees, and the road surface was particularly smooth. The carriage traveled on the road with almost no bumps. On both sides of the road were dense woods, with trees of varying heights forming a thick hedge, completely blocking the view from the outside.

Mu Min knew that the woods on both sides of the road extended for 200 meters. These woods were heavily guarded, and no "unauthorized personnel" were allowed to enter.

The carriage arrived at the entrance of the transmigrator residential area. A red and white barrier blocked the road. A guard walked towards him, wearing an army uniform with a corporal's rank, carrying a five-shot shotgun on his shoulder. Another guard stood by, with two revolvers slung across his chest. He carefully rested his hand on the grip of his gun. A black police dog, as a supplement to the two guards, lay lazily on the side.

The guard did not know her. As a member of the powerful organs, she rarely went home and naturally did not remember the guards' faces. Moreover, the guards here were sent by the Lingao Garrison and did not belong to any of the existing powerful organs in Lingao, but were only administratively subordinate to the army.

The guard held a binder in his hand. Mu Min handed over her credentials and the authorization document from the Arbitration Tribunal. The guard looked at them carefully for a long time, then at her face, then handed the documents back and saluted.

"Thank you, Chief!"

Mu Min took the documents, got out of the carriage, looked around, and asked, "What's the standard inspection procedure here?"

"Every vehicle and every person is checked. Credentials are checked. If the person is a naturalized citizen, their special pass to enter the residential area is also checked. If they are carrying items, the items are checked."

"Do you check the vehicles?"

"The vehicles of the transmigrators themselves and their life secretaries are not checked, unless there is an order from the General Office. All other vehicles are checked."

"Tell me, what procedures and documents are required for naturalized citizens to enter and exit here? Which naturalized citizens can get permission?"

"Yes, Chief!" The guard did not dare to be negligent. The visitor was not only a transmigrator but also a senior officer of the National Police. There was a murder here yesterday, which was a major security incident. The arrival of this female chief in a black uniform must be related to this.

"There are four types of naturalized citizens who can enter the residential area. The first type is the Chief's life secretary. They can enter and exit the residential area freely with their own work permits. The second type is the long-term service personnel of the residential area: including guards, secretaries, laundry women, cleaners, gardeners, etc. They hold special passes issued by the General Office and enter and exit the residential area at specific times. They are not allowed to enter or exit outside of these times. The third type is the temporary guests of the transmigrators, who are issued short-term passes by the transmigrators themselves, which are generally valid for no more than 24 hours. The pass holder must be led by the transmigrator himself or the transmigrator's life secretary to enter and exit, one or two people at a time, with a maximum of three. The last type is temporary entry personnel, including messengers from the General Office, delivery workers, coachmen, etc. They enter and exit the residential area with their own credentials and a one-time dispatch permit. The dispatch permit is valid for the day."

Mu Min thought that the system was quite strict.

"Do you have an entry and exit registration record?"

"Yes."

"Bring it to me. I want to see if a girl named Lin Xiaoya entered the residential area on August 31st."

The guard walked back to the sentry box. A moment later, he returned with a thick register.

"Yes, someone named Lin Xiaoya did enter the residential area on August 31st. She used a temporary guest pass for a transmigrator." He turned to that page and pointed to an entry with his finger. "It was at 4:20 PM."

"Were you on duty at that time?"

"Yes. I was on duty. I was on the day shift from 6 AM to 6 PM."

"Which transmigrator's guest was Lin Xiaoya?"

"The pass was issued by Transmigrator Yang Xinwu." The guard said, turned and walked in, and brought back a card—a temporary guest pass for a transmigrator. There was no photo on the pass; it used fingerprint registration. It recorded the temporary guest's name, age, occupation, and physical characteristics, and the validity period. At the bottom was the transmigrator's name seal. There was no mistake; this was the transmigrator's name seal uniformly carved by the General Office.

"Did Transmigrator Yang personally bring her in?"

"No, it was Chief Yang's secretary, Yang Jihong, who brought her in. Look, this is the companion's signature." The guard pointed to the registration column. The companion's column was indeed signed with this name in a crooked hand.

Mu Min nodded.

"When did Lin Xiaoya leave here?"

"That night at 10:10 PM."

"What does the original record say?"

"Here," the guard pointed. "It was still Transmigrator Yang's life secretary who sent her away, using the carriage here."

"Did you see her leave?"

"I was not on duty. I went off duty at 6 PM."

"Are the vehicles entering and exiting not checked?"

"The vehicles of the transmigrators and their life secretaries are not checked when entering or exiting."

"Are the entry and exit records of Transmigrator Yang and his life secretary all registered?"

"No, except for entry and exit during the night curfew, we do not record the entry and exit of the Chief and his life secretary at other times."

"From what time to what time is the night curfew?"

"From June to September, it's from 5 AM to 7 PM. Other times, it's from 6 AM to 6 PM."

"I understand," Mu Min said. "I want to seize the register and this pass as evidence."

"Of course, but you have to issue a receipt from the Arbitration Tribunal. Otherwise, I can't hand it over to anyone."

"No problem. Xiao Wu!"

Mu Min called out, and Wu Xiang jumped out of the carriage and came over to handle the seizure of evidence.

A burst of birdsong startled Mu Min. She looked past the guard and saw the artificial lake under the shade of the trees. A flock of water birds was foraging on the lake, chirping from time to time. Two small boats were docked at the sky pier.

"What's the situation on the lake shore? Is anyone on guard?"

The guard nodded: "The patrol boat patrols the lake once an hour. And there are watchtowers by the lake."

Armed guards, patrols, police dogs—it would be very difficult for an outsider to infiltrate, kill someone, and then escape calmly. The breakthrough in the case was obviously with this Transmigrator Yang, whom she did not know.

She took out a business card and handed it to the corporal: "Come to this address tomorrow and give a statement. Understand? And the sentry on duty last night, what's his name?"

The corporal said the name, a little apprehensive: "Chief, we acted completely in accordance with the regulations..."

"Don't worry, it's fine as long as you explain it clearly," Mu Min comforted him.

"Yes, Chief."

After Wu Xiang finished the evidence procedures, Mu Min got back into the carriage and entered the residential area.
