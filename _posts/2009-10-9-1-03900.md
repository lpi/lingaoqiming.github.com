On the car ride back to the base, [Xiao Zishan][y001] made small talk with the four newcomers, chatting about the weather. Whenever someone tried to ask a substantive question, [Xiao Zishan][y001] would immediately start talking about how hard the driver worked, how low his prices were, and how difficult it was to make a living as an unlicensed taxi driver, the subtext being: *don't talk nonsense in front of an outsider.*

Meng Xian got out of the car and took a deep breath of fresh air. The environment here wasn't bad at all. He turned his head and saw three or four young men in training uniforms already there, helping to unload the luggage.

The four newcomers were welcomed into the dormitory. The dorm retained the structure of the old military barracks. Although somewhat dilapidated, it was still convenient to use. The room contained three iron-framed bunk beds, and basic necessities like military blankets, sleeping mats, slippers, washbasins, cups, toothbrushes, and towels were all provided, showing a considerable degree of care.

"Everyone, please sit, sit," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a broad smile, waving his hand in the manner of a leader from the movies. "The living conditions are a bit spartan, I hope everyone can get used to it. Hehe, after all, the place we're going to is even tougher."

"It's much better than I imagined," said the bespectacled man who introduced himself as Tian Jiujiu, looking around.

"We try to make it as comfortable as possible for everyone. After all, there's still some time before D-Day. We need to be well-rested to be in good shape," [Xiao Zishan][y001] continued. "In a moment, everyone please go to Building One to register."

For the next few hours, they first filled out a personal status registration form on a computer. It was the usual stuff: name, date of birth, education, major, work experience, and various skills and professional certificates. The section on special skills was particularly detailed. The electronic form broke down skills into thirteen major categories and over a hundred items, with different proficiency levels for each skill. [Xiao Zishan][y001] was there to guide them, repeatedly urging them to be as accurate and detailed as possible. There was also a section for hobbies and interests, which was also very detailed. It took each person almost twenty minutes to complete the form. Next, they were taken to the infirmary, where an expert-looking man in a white coat checked the medical examination reports they had brought from their local check-up centersâ€”everyone had been required to undergo a full, detailed medical examination before coming. This medical information was also entered into the computer one by one. They also had to submit proof of completion for the various immunizations required by the Executive Committee, done at their local disease control centers. The man in the white coat repeatedly reminded them: this was a matter of life and death, so they shouldn't hide anything. If they hadn't completed the requirements, they could get the shots here.

Finally, the doctor gave each of them two white pills and told them to take them on the spot.

"What's this?" Zha Wuchu asked, looking at the pills with suspicion.

"Deworming medicine," the man in the white coat explained succinctly.

"I don't have worms," Zha Wuchu protested, feeling greatly insulted.

"Just take it. It won't do you any harm," the man in the white coat said, unmoved. "You are going to a place without modern sanitation facilities."

After taking the medicine, the group found themselves in the dental office. This time, it was a young man who tapped around in each of their mouths. Apparently, their teeth were all in good condition, as the young dentist didn't bring out any terrifying instruments like drills. Just as they were all relaxing and preparing to leave, the dentist tore off three appointment slips.

"Come back the day after tomorrow at three in the afternoon for a dental cleaning."

When they returned to the registration office, still filled with terror of the dentist, [Xiao Zishan][y001] was already waiting for them behind a computer, holding a pile of metal necklace-like objects.

"These are your ID tags," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, distributing the chains. Besides a metal plate engraved with a name and a serial number, there was also a small, USB-drive-like object sealed in an opaque material.

"Dog tags," someone said.

"Hehe, right. But electronic ones." [Xiao Zishan][y001] explained the use of the dog tags. The metal plate was nothing special, but the USB-like object was an ID card. Through induction, it could automatically pull up each person's full detailed profile from the server database. Of course, the card also functioned like a university all-in-one card.

"So we can use this card to eat? Do we need to charge it?"

"No need to charge it. You can eat at the cafeteria with the card. From now on, we are on a supply system," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, gesturing for them to sit down. "Let me explain. Everything at the base is on a supply system. If you need anything, you can apply to the Executive Committee's logistics group, and we will issue it to you. But please note that this is limited to daily necessities. If you want to smoke or drink, you still have to spend RMB. There is a small shop here."

"What about internet access?" Zha Wuchu seemed to have a serious internet addiction.

"That's also free. But you need to log in with your ID card to get online."

"This is communism."

"There are still some days until D-Day, but it will be within the next month or two. As for the many key points and regulations, the Executive Committee has already spoken with you all before you came."

Everyone nodded.

"Please try not to go out much for the time being. If you must go out, you have to ask for leave. The logistics group has already delivered your allocated items to your dormitory. Also, the Planning and Coordination Group would like to inspect the luggage you brought. There might be some things you forgot to bring, and some things will need to be handed over to the resource group for unified use." [Xiao Zishan][y001] smiled. "Of course, we will compensate you at market value. Whether it's converted into shares or points will be up to you."

"There will be a general assembly soon. Everyone should rest well for a few days. It would be best to go to the internet cafe here, log in with your ID card, and review the internal documents. They contain our plan overview and progress. Think it over carefully. If you want to quit, all your belongings and money will be returned to you."

"If we wanted to quit, we wouldn't have come," someone said.

"It's okay, think it over again. After all, you will be completely disappearing from this world. People are not plants; everyone has attachments. Think about whether you can really make this decision."

***

In the base's large conference room, name cards were set on the table. With the onlookers, the dozen or so people made for a lively scene.

[Wen Desi][y002] glanced out the window. "Are we being watched?" He threw down a spade.

"That's right. I heard about it when I was playing cards at the People's Armed Forces Department the day before yesterday," said Zhong Lishi, who had made extensive local connections over the past year. "I heard the police department called to ask about this matter."

"It's nothing. We're running a company, not breaking the law," Wei Aiwen said, propping his feet up on a chair.

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] slowly played a card. "Watching porn isn't illegal either, but would you do it on the street?" He frowned. "You haven't washed your feet again, have you?"

"Well, we're not watching porn either," Wei Aiwen said, greatly displeased. Everyone here spoke in riddles, their words veiled and indirect.

"That would be called 'organizing a group to watch pornography.' If this were the 'Strike Hard' campaign of the 80s, you'd be eligible for a firing squad," [Xiao Zishan][y001] chuckled.

"You're just talking nonsense. Getting shot for watching porn? Are you also getting paid 50 cents a post?" Wei Aiwen immediately retorted.

"That is the greatness of time," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said cryptically before returning to his notebook. "I feel like something has been off recently. There was a very suspicious person at the station yesterday."

"Could it be the legendary Ministry of State Security?"

"It's hard to say," [Xiao Zishan][y001] paused. He had meant to tell everyone when he got back, but he had forgotten. "Maybe he was just a random visitor. I got the feeling he was from some organ of the dictatorship..."

"That's the same as saying nothing," Wei Aiwen immediately attacked.

"Well," [Xiao Zishan][y001] admitted, "but I feel he was particularly interested in the word 'transmigration'."

The room fell silent for a moment, as if a secret had been exposed.

After a few minutes, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said to [Wen Desi][y002], "[Director Wen][y002], should we speed things up a bit? Most of the people are here now. Those who aren't coming won't be coming."

"How much faster can we go?" [Wen Desi][y002] said slowly, shuffling the cards. "We still don't have a ship!"

"Can't we rent one?"

"Who would rent to a new company like ours, established for less than a year? Even if they were willing, the cost would be almost the same as buying a new one."

"Let's just buy a second-hand one."

"This isn't like buying a used car where you can just go to a market and look around. The paperwork is a huge hassle. [Wang Luobin][y003] has been running around dealing with this for the past two months."

"Let's just spend more money to clear the way. Let's not be too picky. If it's expensive, it's expensive," Zhong Lishi suggested. "RMB will be useless to us soon anyway."

"We still need to keep some on hand for emergencies."

"Let's just prepare some gold and silver. In an emergency, anyone will recognize that."

"Speaking of gold and silver, should we bring a batch of 925 industrial silver? It would be best to directly mint some Spanish pesos to take with us. Otherwise, how will we trade with the natives when we get there?"

"There was no shortage of silver in that era. Bringing silver with us would be, first, not cost-effective, and second, it would take up tonnage. Trade doesn't have to rely on real gold and silver. Bartering is fine," [Luo Duo][y011] said dismissively.

"Industrial production has its stages!" Zhong Lishi became agitated. "How long do you think it will take for our factories to reach a production capacity sufficient for trade? At least three months, right? Where will you get the funds for supplies and construction during those three months? Don't just say we can go rob people!"

"Brother, have you heard of salt..." [Luo Duo][y011] said slowly. "Since ancient times, salt has been a universal currency. At least in the era we are going to, it will still have considerable purchasing power for buying things from the natives."

Zhong Lishi calmed down a bit. "Do we know how to make salt?"

"No, but we know *how* to make salt. I have a ton of information on hand. Refined salt, iodized salt, pickling salt..." [Luo Duo][y011] smiled with gusto. "Who among us knows how to make steel? Who knows how to make glass? Who knows how to make a rifle? We possess the accumulated wisdom of three thousand years of civilization, and all the modern technology since the Industrial Revolutionâ€”" He made a dramatic wave of his hand. "We are omnipotent!"

This statement, which he thought was full of infectious power, fell into the room like a stone into a swamp, making a small splash and then disappearing. Apart from a skeptical glance from Zhong Lishi, it failed to create any ripples.

For the next few minutes, [Luo Duo][y011] showed off his knowledge of salt production, occasionally getting into unprofessional and subjective arguments with Zhong Lishi. Suddenly, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] sighed.

"Why do our discussions here always go off-topic?"

"Habitual digression..." [Wen Desi][y002] said. "Alright, alright, let's talk about our financial problems later. [Zishan][y001], what's the status of the personnel check-in?" He seemed to remember something. "How are those four people you brought back?"
