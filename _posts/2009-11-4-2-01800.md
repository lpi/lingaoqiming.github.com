Chatting, they learned that this family had chartered a boat for a trip to Hainan, suddenly encountered a storm and got lost, and then were captured and brought onto the ship. The old man, Ming Qiu, had served in the South Sea Fleet of the Navy stationed in Hainan for many years. After being transferred to civilian work, he worked in the civil affairs department. The old lady, Li Mei, had been a leader in a trading company for many years—no wonder she had a calm demeanor and spoke appropriately. As for the son, Ming Lang, who had been silent all along, he was a civil servant in the safety production supervision department. This family still had no clue about their own situation.

"That committee member named Xiao, he keeps saying this is Lingao County in 1628. Isn't that nonsense? Our old man was in the navy in Hainan for 22 years and has been to Lingao countless times... I see he's a decent young man, not like a lunatic."

So they were the same as them. Guo Yi thought that they were also in the dark. As they were talking, the old man who had been walking around on the river beach looking at the stone carvings in a daze suddenly walked back, his face extremely ugly, his eyes dull.

Li Mei hurriedly helped him sit down. Seeing his appearance, she became flustered. When did this old man become so dispirited? Could he have been possessed by something evil in the wilderness? Speaking of which, the bodies they encountered on the road were indeed strange.

She asked him for a long time how he was feeling. Only then did Old Man Ming raise his head and say two words:

"It's over."

This made the whole family anxious. The old man was usually stubborn and never admitted defeat. How could he suddenly say such a thing?

"Dad, don't scare us..." Ming Lang quickly supported his father.

"What on earth is wrong? You're being so cryptic, you're going to scare me to death!" Li Mei was so anxious she was jumping up and down.

"This place, it really is Lingao!"

"What?!" The other four people sitting on the rocks all cried out in alarm. The two ATF agents had no concept of Lingao and looked at them with a puzzled expression.

"That's right," Old Man Ming pointed with a trembling finger at the rock engraved with the three large characters "Bairen Tan." "This is Bairen Tan in Lingao." As he spoke, he took out a yellowed small photo album from his pocket. Inside were old photos taken in the past.

"Look at this one!" Everyone craned their necks. In the photo, a middle-aged Ming Qiu in a naval officer's uniform was standing next to an identical rock with a comrade-in-arms. The rock was also impressively engraved with the three characters "Bairen Tan"!

"That's nothing," Ming Lang said hesitantly. "We've just arrived at Bairen Tan."

"Look behind!" the old man said anxiously.

Everyone quickly looked again. In the background of the photo, there was a dam in the distance. Looking up again, behind the identical Bairen Tan carved stone, there was no dam at all!

[Note: The Bairen Tan carved stone is located between the dam of the hydroelectric power station and the power plant. So it can be fully captured in the photo.]

Now a chill ran down everyone's spine. Where was the dam? Mu Min said, "They're renovating small hydropower stations now, maybe it's been demolished..."

"No, that's impossible." The old man shook his head stubbornly. "The Bairen Tan hydropower station has always been the main power station in Lingao. How could it be demolished? My comrades-in-arms in Lingao never mentioned it."

"Maybe he forgot to say."

"I came to Bairen Tan a few years ago, and the environment around Bairen Tan was not like this! There should be a farm not far from here," the old man continued. "But the terrain is exactly the same as here! The rocks in the water, and the stone carvings..." The old man flipped through the photos. "When I was a soldier in Hainan, I came to Bairen Tan at least ten times. I've taken pictures of the stone carvings and strange rocks..."

"Actually, from the moment I walked near the beach, I was suspicious... The surrounding environment is too strange..." The old man's hands trembled. "At that time, I felt that I had been to this place before, like in a dream."

Guo Yi snatched the photo album and rushed down to the beach to see. He compared the photos one by one, and the more he compared, the more flustered he became. He knew why the old man was so dispirited. It was too bizarre. Unless there was an identical terrain in the world, there was no way to explain the current situation. The stone carvings in the photos, whether it was the font, the appearance of the stones, or their position in the water, all indicated that this was the same place.

If there was any difference, it was that there were things here that were not in the photos: a few particularly large rocks in the river. There were also some things that were in the photos but not here: the disappeared dam, and some stone carvings. He looked carefully for a long time and discovered a terrible fact: the stone carvings were all from before the Qing Dynasty! And the Ming Dynasty stone carvings were the most clearly discernible, with very little sign of weathering. There was a stone carving in Old Man Ming's photo that read "Linjiang Tianlai." The font was large enough to see the inscription on the top: "First year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, spring." Guo Yi found this rock, but there was not a single word on it. He didn't give up and called over Xue Ziliang, who claimed to be an expert in traceology, and asked him to examine all the rocks that should have had stone carvings for any signs of grinding or chiseling. Xue Ziliang scraped away the thick moss and examined them for a long time, declaring that these rocks had never been carved.

[Note: The above stone carvings can still be seen on Bairen Tan today. Currently, they are mainly from the Qing Dynasty, and those from the Ming Dynasty are rare, but many records of the stone carvings at that time can still be found in the county annals.]

Guo Yi's expression when he returned made everyone even more flustered. Suddenly, the other three members of the Ming family all went down to the river beach. The two ATF agents who had been puzzled all along also looked grim.

The current situation was exactly "between a rock and a hard place." No one was willing to believe that this was ancient China, but the evidence was so strong that it couldn't be explained away by any reason. Should they continue up the river or return to the river mouth immediately? No one in the group had a clue, and their hearts were empty.

Going forward, who knew what they would encounter. If there was a first attack, there would be a second. They didn't even know who the attackers were or why they were attacking. After some discussion, they felt that since they had reached Bairen Tan and were only 4-5 kilometers away from Lingao County, it was better to try to go and see. Not to mention, it would be more reassuring for the injured to stay in a people's hospital. If there was no people's hospital in Lingao and only a county yamen, they would have to go back to Bopu. At least, it seemed that this group of crazy people had no intention of killing them, and there seemed to be a Red Cross flag flying at the beach camp.

They decided to split into two groups. Old Man Ming himself, Little Guo, and Xue Ziliang would go to Lingao to scout, while the others would temporarily stay here. The terrain of Bairen Tan was complex, and it was not difficult to hide. Little Guo objected, saying that he was old and the long journey might be too tiring. Ming Qiu said that he was familiar with the terrain and could tell if it was Lingao at a glance, which was better than them bumping around randomly. Xue Ziliang was worried that it would be too dangerous for the women to stay behind. Ming Qiu said it was fine, his son and daughter-in-law were both combatants. Not to mention his daughter-in-law was a police officer, his son was also a master of street fighting with a knife when he was in middle school, and had rich experience in street brawls—Little Guo was deeply skeptical about this.

The newly formed Lingao reconnaissance team left all their luggage behind, each carrying only a wooden stick, a dagger, and a small amount of food. Ming Qiu instructed his wife, "If we don't come back in two hours, you guys should go back immediately." The family's separation was a bit sad. The old lady's eyes were teary, and she kept telling him to be careful and not to be brave. She also repeatedly asked the two men to take care of the old man. This speech probably hurt the old man's self-esteem. He snorted, got up, and walked away on his own.

Little Guo and Xue Ziliang quickly caught up. The three of them trekked all the way, heading for the county town.

Their expedition was very smooth. Along the way, Old Man Ming recognized more and more familiar scenery. When the outline of Lingao County appeared before them, Ming Qiu was speechless for a long time after seeing the city wall that had never been in his memory. When they saw the camp being built outside the city gate and the ancient laborers crawling up and down like ants, the three of them turned pale. Xue Ziliang sat on the ground, holding his head in his hands, muttering something in English.

Such a terrifyingly small probability, no, it should be an impossible thing, how could it fall on me! Why not win the 20 million lottery! Little Guo felt as if he had been pierced by ten thousand arrows.

After standing there for a long time, there was nothing to discuss. Let's go back to Bopu quickly. At least there was a group of modern people from the 21st century there, and more importantly, they were all Chinese. Xue Ziliang was deeply stimulated and muttered to himself in English all the way.

At 13:20 in the afternoon, the Bopu-Bairen Tan highway survey team reported by radio that they had seen several bodies floating down from the upper reaches of the Wenlan River, all of whom should be local natives.

At 14:36 in the afternoon, the reconnaissance team under Lingao City reported that someone was leading a small group of local braves into the city.

At 15:02, the Bopu-Bairen Tan highway survey team reported that the two groups that had set out in the morning had returned in a sorry state, looking dispirited, and were shouting to see the leader.

"Little Yu, it seems your plan has been realized," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said to Yu E'shui, half flattering and half worried.

"Lion's shit is better than bear's piss," Little Yu said calmly. "I guess they had a hard time on the road."

"Committee Member Xiao, should we see them?" [Li Yuanyuan][y007] asked.

"No," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said gruffly. "You go and receive them and let them settle down first. By the way, notify Ran Yao to issue each of them a temporary ID card."

"Temporary ID card?" [Li Yuanyuan][y007] was stunned. She had been handling documents for the Executive Committee for almost a year and had never heard of such a thing.

"Yes, temporary. Ran Yao knows. They are not yet official transmigrators."
