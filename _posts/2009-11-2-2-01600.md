Guo Yi dove onto the rocky ground. A stone jabbed him in the chest, nearly knocking the wind out of him. The potential that a person can unleash in a moment of crisis is astonishing. In a series of rolls, he scrambled to the side of a large rock. In less than a minute, he had already glimpsed Sarlina, apparently hit by an arrow, lying motionless on the ground.

Xue Ziliang reacted even faster. Perhaps because he was tall and a clear target, most of the arrows were aimed at him. He was hit by four or five in an instant. Guo Yi saw him on the ground, slithering like a fish across the pebbly surface, shrugging off his backpack with one hand while grabbing the strap of Sarlina's pack with the other, dragging her over. Arrows continued to fly in their direction, but their accuracy had worsened considerably.

"Guo, shoot!" Xue Ziliang roared as he pulled the woman. Guo Yi was startled by the twisted muscles on his face. He was, after all, a man who had spent years sitting in an office, and his reaction time was a bit slow. He had just come to his senses. He raised his pistol and fired several shots in the direction the arrows came from. In the chaos, he didn't know how many rounds he had fired, but a pained scream immediately came from the grass.

Taking advantage of this opening, Xue Ziliang had already hoisted Sarlina onto his back and was running in a crouch. Guo Yi quickly followed. In his haste, he felt a push from behind, as if he had been hit by an arrow, but he didn't dare to look.

More than a dozen people burst out from the nearby woods and tall grass, charging fiercely, wielding six-to-seven-foot-long white wooden staves, and beating at them wildly. Caught off guard, Guo Yi was hit many times, but fortunately, his backpack absorbed much of the force. He fired two shots, knocking one down and forcing the others back.

"Charge forward!" Xue Ziliang roared, picking up a white wooden staff that had fallen to the ground—its owner, dressed in strange clothes, was writhing and groaning in pain on the ground. Although he was carrying a person on his back, he was confident in his strength and was not alarmed. The arrows that had hit him earlier had either been stopped by his bulletproof vest or had not hit vital areas. At this moment, he knew that turning back to run was a dead end; only by charging forward could they possibly break through the encirclement.

Guo Yi had just taken a blow to the head and was now dizzy. To make matters worse, he had dropped his pistol, which was out of ammunition, in the chaos. But when he saw a man in a blue robe directing the crowd to block and kill them with a long saber, his spirits suddenly lifted. With a great roar, he rushed straight at him. The man, seeing him coming, did not dodge but swung his saber to meet him. In that instant, Guo Yi's mind went blank—was this a historical drama?! The man clearly had his hair in a bun and was wearing a long blue robe. In his moment of hesitation, the opponent's saber had already slashed down, hitting him squarely on the shoulder blade. The intense pain almost made him drop his staff. Several others rushed over and beat him with their white wooden staves. Guo Yi fell to the ground. As he desperately protected his head and swung his staff to resist, his mind, in its panic, became as clear as a mirror—he was going to be beaten to death by these people! In his despair, he suddenly heard a thunderous roar:

"Son of a bitch!"

The head of a man in front of Little Guo suddenly exploded before his eyes. Brains, blood, and bone fragments flew out, spraying all over him. The sight of the red and white mixture scattering everywhere remained fresh in his memory for decades.

Xue Ziliang, who had already run some distance, saw his companion trapped. He quickly put Sarlina down and rushed back, sneaking up from behind and smashing a man's head with his staff. The people nearby, seeing how ferocious he was, panicked for a moment. Seizing the opportunity, Guo Yi scrambled and rolled away.

However, this group of people did not scatter. Hearing someone shout something in an unknown language, the dozen or so men regrouped and charged again. Because Xue Ziliang had to pick up Sarlina, he was delayed for a moment and was caught up. He was hit several times with staves, but the blows all landed on Sarlina. The woman cried out, and blood sprayed from her mouth, covering Xue Ziliang's face.

Seeing that Xue Ziliang was encumbered by carrying a person and was about to be struck down, Guo Yi ignored the pain in his body and quickly returned with his staff to block the attackers. The men in front swung their white wooden staves wildly at his head, like falling rain. At this moment of life and death, Guo Yi went berserk, swinging his staff wildly and forcing the opponents back several steps.

His heart settled a little. He saw that his opponents were all gaunt and emaciated, a size smaller than them in both height and build, and his courage returned. Seeing that they swung their staves without any technique, just wild, wide-open smashes, he stood his ground. Using the bayonet techniques he had learned from his instructor during military training, he took a large step forward as they fell back in disarray. With a forward thrust, although the wooden staff had no point, the full-force blow shattered the opponent's chin and nose. The man screamed, fell to the ground, and rolled around clutching his face, wailing incessantly.

The man in the blue robe, shouting something, led the charge himself, slashing with his saber. Guo Yi turned his body to the side, executed a "left-side defense," and viciously smashed the end of his staff into the blue-robed man's face. In a flash, with a scream, a black and white eyeball flew out.

The dozen or so attackers, seeing him covered in blood, his face ferocious, and having taken down their leader with one blow, were suddenly filled with fear. With a cry, they dragged the blue-robed man and fled in disarray. Many years later, the people in this area still vividly told the story of how Guo Yi and Xue Ziliang fought off ten men each, their two staves sending the opponents fleeing in defeat.

"Well done! Guo, you're practically Bruce Lee!"

Guo Yi waved his hand weakly and collapsed to the ground, panting heavily. He had been in the security department for many years and had been on many missions, but he had never been so terrified, feeling like he had taken a walk by the gates of hell. Now that the tension was gone, his whole body ached. His face was wet. He touched it and found it was all blood, he didn't know if it was his own or from those strange guys.

"Guo, we have to go, quickly! These guys might come back!" Xue Ziliang called out.

"I need to check the situation!" Guo Yi said. Using his staff as a crutch, he limped towards the fallen bodies. He wanted to search these strange characters and also see if he could find his pistol.

After getting back on the road and walking for another kilometer, they were all exhausted. The pain from their injuries was getting worse. They hadn't noticed anyone following them, so they decided to hide and rest for a while to bandage their wounds before considering where to go next. Ahead, the river made a big bend, forming a rocky beach where the water rushed and roared over the stones like thunder. They found a secluded spot by the river, a small cave in a pile of rocks, surrounded by tall grass and dense woods, making it difficult for others to spot.

Xue Ziliang used a rubber water bladder to fetch clean water from the river to wash away the blood and inspect their wounds. Although he had been hit by arrows like a porcupine, none had actually pierced his flesh. Most of the arrows had hit his backpack, and the rest had been stopped by his bulletproof vest. Besides some scrapes on his face and hands from rolling on the ground, he had no wounds. He had also taken the fewest blows from the staves.

Guo Yi had also been hit by several arrows. Fortunately, he had put on his anti-stab vest as soon as they set out. None had penetrated. Only one arrow had hit his arm, but it was cushioned by the thick fabric of his training uniform and had only gone in shallowly. It came out with a slight pull. Xue Ziliang looked at the rusty arrowhead and shook his head repeatedly, disinfecting the wound with antiseptic from the first-aid kit.

"Guo, you need a tetanus shot," he said. "Although the wound is not deep, this arrowhead..."

"I know, but there's nothing we can do now..." Guo Yi was completely exhausted, and his whole body ached. It wasn't just tetanus. He had a cut on his head that should have been stitched up, but for now, he could only clean, disinfect, and bandage it. The saber blow to his shoulder had been blocked by the anti-stab vest, but it hurt so much now that he couldn't even lift his arm. He didn't know if he had injured his muscles or bones. He had also been hit many times with the staves. He was afraid he had broken bones or internal injuries, but fortunately, he hadn't felt anything unusual so far.

In comparison, Sarlina's condition was not ideal. She had an arrow wound in her leg, but fortunately, it had been deflected by the strap of her knee pad and had not gone in deep. However, she had acted as a human shield while being carried by Xue and had taken several blows to the back. It seemed she had some internal injuries. The problem was that she was running a fever, probably caused by a cold. There was fever medicine in the first-aid kit. Xue Ziliang dissolved it in water and fed it to her.

Outside, it began to rain lightly. The cave was small. With Sarlina lying down, their legs were all outside. Xue Ziliang took out a waterproof tarp from his backpack and covered each of them.

Guo Yi's head ached, and his mind was in turmoil. The desperate fight just now, besides being a matter of life and death, had brought him other troubles. These people, from their clothes to their appearance, were unmistakably ancient people. At first, he was skeptical. He had pulled the hair bun of a dead man and found that it was real, not a wig. Looking at their crude clothes and weapons, they couldn't be props for a TV show—the leader's saber was a real iron weapon, not a machine-made steel blade.

There was nothing on the dead bodies except for some copper coins and small items. Little Guo took them out and examined them for a long time. He could roughly make out that they were "Tianqi Tongbao." What year was Tianqi? He couldn't remember, only that Tianqi was Chongzhen's older brother, the second-to-last emperor of the Ming Dynasty. Almost every dead person had a small pouch containing a curved piece of iron, a stone, and some loose, cotton-like grass. Guo Yi studied it over and over for a long time but couldn't figure out what it was.

"It's a fire striker (*huolian*)," Xue Ziliang leaned over.

"What?"

"A fire striker." He pulled the tarp a little. "You're Chinese, and you don't know? This is the tool your ancestors used to make fire."

"Damn it, aren't your ancestors Chinese too..." Guo Yi cursed, then asked, "How do you know?"

"There's a display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. I've seen it. Look—" Xue Ziliang took the fire striker and the small stone. He held the flint in his left hand, pressing the tinder between the flint and his finger. He held the striker tightly in his right hand and struck the blade against the flint. Many sparks flew out. "I haven't practiced. The person demonstrating at the museum could light the tinder with the sparks after a few strikes. It's amazing."

Guo Yi only felt a chill run down his spine.
