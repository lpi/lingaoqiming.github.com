Dang Na Men's mind raced. The other two mountain paths were narrow and difficult to traverse. The enemy had already seized the advantage by occupying the favorable terrain, and their firearms were powerful. Just a dozen men could hold off a large force. Only the terrain at Dataipo was the flattest and widest. If they all rushed through, they might have a chance to survive.

The others, seeing the logic in his words, quickly discarded the cumbersome valuables they were carrying and rushed towards Dataipo in a swarm.

"Detonate the first group!" Pan Da, seeing the black mass of bandits charging towards them and already within the mine's killing zone, quickly gave the order.

Only eleven of the fifteen directional mines detonated, and at different times, but the violent explosions and the flying stones hit the charging bandits, causing them to bleed from their heads. Many were killed on the spot, and even more were left half-dead, groaning and writhing on the ground.

The chain of explosions and the piercing screams destroyed the bandits' will. They broke and retreated, bleeding and crying out, running around like headless flies. Yang Zeng, with the platoon's marksmen, began to pick off the fleeing bandits with a rare calmness at a distance of two hundred meters. The skill of a shot felling a man stunned the education soldiers. They all crowded around to watch, disrupting the formation.

"Form ranks! Form ranks!" the NCOs shouted desperately, using their bayonet scabbards to drive back the chaotic new recruits, forcing them back into formation.

Pan Da coughed repeatedly, irritated by the smoke from the gunpowder and dust. It seemed there was no need to use those dubious grenade launchers. But the state of the education soldiers made him shake his head. Fortunately, the enemy was few in number and their fighting will was not strong, otherwise they would have been unreliable.

Some of the bandits who had been repulsed at various points retreated back to the vicinity of the stronghold, intending to defend it. But it was already engulfed in flames and could no longer be held.

With no way to the heavens and no gate to the earth, the sound of gunfire and shouts of killing were deafening. The bandits were like stray dogs. In front of the stronghold, Dang Na Men managed to gather more than a hundred men again, preparing to make another charge through Dataipo—staying here meant certain death.

However, before they could set out, they were intercepted by the first platoon, which had come to occupy the stronghold gate. They were first hit by a round of grapeshot from a 12-pounder howitzer, followed by three consecutive volleys of rifle fire. The newly gathered force was immediately scattered, fleeing in all directions.

Dang Na Men, under the desperate cover of Zhao Haiqing and a few trusted followers, managed to escape to a secluded spot on the hillside behind the stronghold. Only four or five of his trusted men were left. Zhao Haiqing had been shot in the back and was being carried. He was constantly spitting up blood foam, and it was clear he wouldn't make it.

"Boss Dang... run, avenge the brothers—" Before Zhao Haiqing could finish, he spat out a mouthful of blood foam, his head lolled to one side, and he died.

The distinctive sound of the Australians' muskets grew closer. Shouts of killing, screams, and groans could be heard everywhere. It was the Australian army killing his brothers. Behind him, the fire in the stronghold had become a raging inferno... Ten years of hard work to build up his power, destroyed in a single day. Now, he was at his wit's end. Although he still had some brothers in the "Thirteen Villages," it was all for naught if he couldn't escape! He thought that the only plan now was to hide until dark and then run. Having made up his mind, he told his men, "You go and find your own way out!" With that, he abandoned his trusted followers and headed for the dense forest and tall grass.

The first platoon, which had broken into the stronghold, quickly secured the nearby key points. After confirming that the enemy inside and outside the stronghold had been cleared, they began to organize the education soldiers to fight the fire. The fire in the stronghold had become difficult to control. The platoon leader had no choice but to direct the education soldiers to tear down the nearby houses to create a firebreak. Only then was the fire gradually brought under control.

At noon, as the main hall was reduced to a pile of charred wood and ashes, the fire was basically extinguished, and the battle entered the mopping-up phase. He Ming led the command post into the stronghold. The stronghold was a mess, with valuables dropped by the fleeing bandits scattered everywhere. The granaries that had not been completely burned were full of grain, enough to last for two or three months. The eaves were hung with all kinds of charred, dried, and cured beef, pork, and poultry.

In a row of houses behind the stronghold, thirty to forty women and a dozen or so old and young men were locked up. The bandits had not unlocked them when they fled, and they had almost been burned to death.

These people all claimed to have been kidnapped by the bandits. Seeing the transmigrator army, they were all terrified, kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy.

"These bandits have harmed so many people," He Ming said, ordering the staff officers to seal the warehouses and organize people to clean up the scattered loot on the ground.

"What about these people? Let them go. They are all poor people who were kidnapped..."

"How do you know there are no bandits or their families among them?" [Luo Duo][y011] shook his head. "Besides, if we let them go in these mountains, what if they encounter bad people or wild animals? Wouldn't that be harming them?"

So it was decided to send these people back to Bairen along with the bandits for screening and further processing.

The education soldiers, led by the veterans, conducted a combing search of the entire area around the stronghold. The pikes they brought with them played an unexpected role at this time. A scream would occasionally come from the grass as the pikes were thrust about, and then a bloody figure would be dragged out. If the person was stabbed in the thigh or a similar place, they might receive medical treatment. If they were stabbed in the stomach or a similar place, a kind-hearted soldier would finish them off with a bayonet. Otherwise, they could only wait for a slow death. Many bandits who were hiding in the grass, hoping to slip away at night, saw this terrible fate and came out to surrender. By evening, they had captured fifty or sixty prisoners and killed the same number. Only three careless education soldiers were killed by bandits who suddenly jumped out. But Dang Na Men had not yet been found—his body was not among the dead.

He Ming saw the education soldiers cutting off heads and tying them together by the hair, hanging them from their waists or pikes. Some had seven or eight heads hanging from their pikes.

"What is this?" He Ming frowned. He was extremely disgusted by this medieval practice of beheading. "We don't reward based on headcounts. Bury the bodies and the heads!"

In the end, only the heads of the leaders were cut off and taken away. Although the transmigrators did not like this method, it was necessary to show the results of the battle to the people of the county.

In the evening, the battlefield cleanup was completed. He Ming withdrew some of the troops from the various roads, giving the few who had escaped a chance to flee. But the roads were already ambushed by special reconnaissance soldiers. They wore night vision goggles and conducted a night hunt for the bandits who were trying to sneak through the blockade under the cover of darkness. In the endless, pitch-black mountain forest, a gunshot would ring out from time to time, and the dying cries of some of those who were hit would echo through the valley all night. In a hunt in the early morning, Dang Na Men was shot and killed in a gully. In the morning, the soldiers had the prisoners identify the body. His head, with most of the skull blown off by a 7.62mm NATO round, was carefully cut off and placed in a wooden box filled with lime.

The next day, the raid on Daolu Village, commanded by Xue Ziliang, was also launched. Led by special reconnaissance team members, a company of infantry marched through the night to Daolu Village and sealed it off. Then, Xue Ziliang led his team straight to the Dang family ancestral hall.

This ancestral hall had been newly built after Dang Na Men became successful. In fact, the Dang family had only settled here for two generations, so it was too early to build an ancestral hall. And his ancestors had all been ordinary farmers, with no official titles or honors to display. So the ancestral hall looked rather empty. But the building itself was made of brick and tile, with three courtyards, which was quite grand not only in the small Daolu Village but also by the standards of the entire county.

After the team had secured the front and back entrances.

"Little Ye, you and your men take the high ground!" Xue Ziliang ordered. "Taking the high ground" meant getting on the roof—a common term among reconnaissance soldiers. It meant controlling the high points of a building to suppress enemy fire and movement. It was a common tactic in street fighting in old Chinese villages and towns with mostly single-story houses. Xue Ziliang personally led a team to charge in through the main gate. An old caretaker, seeing the gate being broken down, hurried out from the gatehouse and shouted:

"This is the ancestral hall of the Dang family—" Seeing a group of strong men in colorful clothes, holding various iron rods, the caretaker was so scared that he stumbled back and fell to the ground, speechless and trembling.

Xue Ziliang, seeing he was an old man, didn't bother him and rushed straight inside. According to intelligence, the bandits were gathered in the second courtyard.

Suddenly, the old man behind them shouted in a shrill, inhuman voice, "Someone's breaking in—"

The native team member behind him had no such respect for the elderly. A swing of his dog-leg machete split the old man's head in half.

At the gate stood two bandit guards. Seeing the situation was not right, one ran straight inside, while the other held his knife horizontally and shouted, "Who are you? How dare you—"

Before the bandit could finish his shout, Xue Ziliang rushed in, and with a swing of his military knife, finished him off on the spot.

"Not good, someone's crashing the party!" the bandit who had run inside shouted, stumbling and crawling.

The room suddenly exploded like a hornet's nest. Many half-dressed men ran out of the rooms with knives and guns. The special operations team members who had already taken the high ground on the roof fired their handheld grapeshot cannons into the courtyard, which was instantly filled with cries of pain and screams.

However, the drawback of this weapon was also obvious. The entire courtyard was filled with gunpowder smoke, making it impossible to see. Xue Ziliang cursed inwardly, "What a piece of junk!" He had no choice but to take cover on both sides of the courtyard entrance and shout:

"Don't move! Surrender and you won't be killed!"

This was shouted in the Lingao dialect he had learned in a crash course. Then the people around him shouted it again in Cantonese and Hokkien. The army, trained by a group of former PLA soldiers, had inevitably picked up many of their habits, such as this pre-battle crash course in shouting.

The response to the shout was a musket shot. Iron pellets hit the wall with a thud. Xue Ziliang and his team members quickly shrank back behind the wall. The sound of rifle fire had already begun from the roof. Suddenly, a figure shot out from the courtyard gate like lightning. The team members couldn't react in time. The figure flickered a few times and was already more than a zhang away. Xue Ziliang swung his Remington, and a huge flame shot out from the muzzle. The person screamed and fell heavily to the ground.

"This kid probably knows qinggong," a young transmigrator soldier next to him said. "He's pretty fast."

"No matter how good his qinggong is, he still eats bullets," Xue Ziliang said with a contemptuous smile. "Prepare to clear the area!"

"Team Xue! Why did you steal my target?" Ye Mengyan poked his head out from the roof. "I had him in my sights!"

"You can have the head."

"I don't want it," Ye Mengyan said, waving the SKS in his hand. "This thing is too long. It's a pain to use it as an assault team member!"

After another round of gunfire, there was no more sound from the courtyard. The special reconnaissance team members went in to search from house to house, throwing both the living and the dead into the courtyard. At this time, a gunshot or two and a scream were heard at the front and back gates of the ancestral hall. Probably a fish that had slipped through the net had tried to escape and was caught.

The nearly thirty people who lived in the ancestral hall, apart from those who were killed, were all kneeling in the courtyard, their hands above their heads, scared stiff like wooden tablets. One of the bandits, who had tried to pull out a small dagger from his leggings while the special reconnaissance team members were not paying attention, had four of his fingers and half of his palm cut off by a soldier's machete. He was rolling on the ground, his wails tearing at the heart, terrifying the other prisoners.

After being identified by the prisoners, the figure who was as light as a swallow and as fast as a ghost was Wang Wushu. At this time, he was lying in the middle of the courtyard, his body riddled with holes like a sieve. A soldier swung his knife and cut off his head.

"Hang it on the gate of the ancestral hall," Xue Ziliang said, feeling a little nauseous, although he had seen many similar cruel scenes.

After counting the prisoners, they found that the last of the Four Great Heavenly Kings, Xin Nari, was missing.

"Where is Xin Nari?"

"He's not among the prisoners, nor among the dead," a team member reported.

"He actually managed to escape from us?" Xue Ziliang found it hard to believe. "Search, turn the place upside down if you have to."

In the end, they couldn't find him even after turning the whole village upside down. After repeated questioning, they learned from the prisoners that Xin Nari had left the day before to visit a lover.

"It doesn't matter if one escaped. We can have the county issue a wanted notice," said Xiong Buyou, who was in charge of coordination. He brought an important piece of news. "Magistrate Wu wants us to send the heads of the bandit leaders to the county as soon as possible to be displayed to the public."

When Wu Mingjin learned that the髡贼 (kūnzéi) were going to launch a large-scale bandit suppression campaign, he knew his opportunity to improve his performance evaluation had come again. He was gradually becoming less hostile to the髡人 (kūn rén - "髡人" is a more neutral term for the transmigrators). Especially after the髡人 had handed over a large number of pirate heads to him last time, which he had reported to his superiors as his own achievement of "personally leading the local militia to attack with all their might." This report of victory had actually won him a lot of praise from the prefect. It was not uncommon to report victories in suppressing bandits, but it was rare to have so many genuine pirate heads and confiscated material evidence, which even gave the prefect face.
