"Director Zhao, the Senate has authorized the formation of a special committee to conduct a comprehensive inspection of all powerful departments, with a focus on your Political Security Bureau. What are your thoughts on this?" Panpan held her notebook, looking at the stout Zhao Manxiong behind the desk.

"I am the Executive Deputy Director," Zhao Manxiong said with a gentle, amiable nod. "Of course, we welcome this with open arms and our full cooperation."

"So, your department will be completely transparent with the investigation committee, with no concealment?"

"The Political Security Bureau has nothing to hide from the Elders."

"Are you certain of that?"

"Yes, very certain." He appeared completely at ease.

"In that case, how will you ensure that this investigation is thoroughly open and transparent?"

"To ensure the thorough openness and transparency of this investigation, the Political Security Bureau's archives and all its offices will be open to the members of the investigation committee. They will be able to access any materials and meet with any staff member, as long as they follow the legal procedures." Zhao Manxiong leaned back in his chair, his hands crossed over his belly. "We will cooperate fully with the investigation. Without reservation."

Panpan was incredulous. He spoke with such confidence. Did the fat man have another card up his sleeve? Cheng Yongxin had spoken to her many times about the Political Security Bureau's black material. She had been chasing this "scoop," comparable to Watergate, for a long time, but had no way in.

The establishment of this investigation committee, specifically targeting the Political Security Bureau, had her buzzing with excitement. Although she hadn't been selected as a committee member in the lottery, as an important cadre in the propaganda department, she had been granted full access to interview throughout the process.

The black material must have been hidden or destroyed already. That's why the fat man is so calm. Panpan was a little disappointed. She decided to go for a direct approach:

"According to certain sources, the Political Security Bureau has been illegally collecting personal black material on the Elders. Do you have any comment on this?"

"That is, of course, baseless slander. The Political Security Bureau has always been committed to serving the Senate and the people, serving the entire cause of the Senate. Any slander against our work is despicable and shameless. We reserve the right to pursue legal action against this rumor."

A standard official response. Flawless. Panpan closed her notebook. "Thank you for your time."

"Not at all, not at all," Zhao Manxiong said, rising to see her out. "Take care."

Watching her close the office door, Zhao Manxiong picked up the phone. "Please have the department heads come to my office."

***

"Alright, comrades, the investigation committee will be here soon." Zhao Manxiong looked at the department heads seated before his desk. "I won't say more than necessary. Do not show any resistance. Smile. Yes, with a smile on your face..."

"This job is impossible," Zhou Botao grumbled. "What power does our Political Security Bureau have? For any slightly larger operation, we have to notify the police for assistance. We don't even have our own action teams. When something goes wrong, we're the ones who take the fall..."

"In our Political Security Bureau, we work ourselves to the bone, and our achievements go unseen, but the blame is for all to see. No wonder Old Zhou would rather be a printer and a part-time cop than come here."

Wu Mu also erupted. "Power? Bullshit! What do we have here besides ideals? Some people complain every day that we have too much power. What's a department head in Bairen City worth..." He was the first in the line of fire in this investigation, the target of concentrated attacks. Everyone knew he was finished. Those with ambitions were all rushing to kick him while he was down. He had already been branded the second Dugu Qiuhun.

Zhao Manxiong maintained his gentle smile, listening to his subordinates' complaints for five minutes. "Comrades, complaining solves nothing. You've known from the beginning: this is a job of ideals. The only thing that can keep you going is your ideals. What is this small setback in the face of our ideals? Comrades, we are growing stronger every day, maturing every day. It's normal for some people to be afraid. We must understand."

Wu Mu asked, "Then what about the investigation into the content of our work..."

"Whatever they want to know, tell them. Whatever they want to see, show them. We have nothing to hide," Zhao Manxiong said. "But, any review of files, duplication of materials, or interviews must be documented in writing. Especially interviews, there must be a recording or a transcript signed by all parties. Non-committee members, non-counterpart members, are not allowed to investigate outside their scope."

"Understood."

"You may all go back to your work. Continue with your tasks," Zhao Manxiong said. "Wu Mu, stay behind."

***

"Little Wu, I've read your self-criticism," Zhao Manxiong said, taking a document from his desk. "I've made some revisions for you. But my advice is, you can keep the self-criticism, but don't submit it."

"Is that alright?" Wu Mu took it with some hesitation.

"If the situation develops to that point, you can use this to make an oral self-criticism at the meeting. Don't submit a written one," Zhao Manxiong said. "A written self-criticism goes into your file..."

"Yes, I understand. Thank you."

"Don't mention it," Zhao Manxiong said, shifting his portly frame in the rattan chair. "An oral self-criticism, don't take it to heart..."

"I am fully prepared mentally now..."

"Don't be burdened. You are not Dugu Qiuhun. Even if he were, the organization would not abandon him," Zhao Manxiong said. "We are facing a temporary setback right now, but with setbacks comes progress. No matter where you go to work, you must remember this."

"7648, get up!" The guard's loud shout was accompanied by the sound of an iron door opening. Liu Fuqing walked down the corridor of the single-cell block.

The cell door was already open. It was clean inside, without the filth and stench of a Ming prison. A relatively young man staggered up from the wooden plank bed, looking at Liu Fuqing with weary eyes. He whispered, "Are you here to congratulate me?"

"Lin Ming, your case has been clarified," Liu Fuqing said. "Consider yourself lucky. You weren't involved."

Lin Ming was worn down by the relentless interrogation, day and night. Fortunately, the Ao-Song prisons were different from those of the Ming. They were clean, and there were no abusive jailers. After the interrogations ended, he had been allowed to rest for a few days, which helped him recover. Though his spirit was still weak, the words "consider yourself lucky" registered. He felt a jolt and raised his head, saying hesitantly, "You mean..."

"Yes, you're fine. You're not going to die," Liu Fuqing said with a small smile. "Come with me."

Lin Ming looked at the sunlight outside the window, almost unable to open his eyes. How many days had it been since he'd seen the sun? Since his arrest, he had completely lost track of time. All he saw, day and night, were the ever-burning gas lamps.

The bandits's interrogation had been an eye-opener. Perhaps that was a bitter way to put it, for himself. But for the first time, Lin Ming learned that there was a kind of interrogation that didn't involve whips or instruments of torture. Although he knew from the occasional screams he heard that the Australians probably had tortures more terrible than those of the Ming, he had, to his shame, completely broken down during the second round of questioning. He vaguely remembered sobbing, snot and tears streaming down his face, begging the interrogator on the floor to let him close his eyes for a moment.

What had he confessed? His muddled brain couldn't recall a thing. Probably everything. Even how many wives and concubines he had, and what positions he used with them in bed. For a chance to sleep, he would have told the Australians anything they wanted to know.

But why were they taking him here now? He knew their laws were extremely harsh. If he had been part of that mysterious colleague's group, he would either be hanged by now or suffering in the dreaded labor camps, slowly "working to death."

Since he was not involved in the case, he could probably escape that terrible fate. But, as a member of the Jinyiwei who had infiltrated Lingao under a false name, he probably wouldn't get off so easily.

I wonder how my sister-in-law is doing...

As his mind wandered, the door opened. A young man walked in. Lin Ming stood up as if by reflex.

"Sit," the visitor said. He was young, but plain-looking. "I am Li Yan, Director of the Ming Division of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau."

Lin Ming nodded mechanically. He had no idea what that string of titles meant.

"As a member of the Ming Jinyiwei, you infiltrated Lingao under a false identity. You should know what that's called."

"Yes," Lin Ming said respectfully. "Sir, I came to Lingao with no ill will towards the Senate. It was purely to find Li Yongxun."

"If you had come on a mission, do you think you would still be sitting here talking to me in one piece?" the director of the Ming Division sneered. "Centurion Lin, it seems you still feel wronged by your current situation."

"No, no, I'm not wronged," Lin Ming said quickly, lowering his head. "I brought this upon myself..."

Li Yan took out a pack of cigarettes. "Have one?"

Lin Ming was not in the habit of smoking tobacco, but out of a desire to please, he reached out a trembling hand to take one. Li Yan struck a match to light it for him. Startled, Lin Ming quickly brought the cigarette to the flame.

The smoke was harsh and bitter. Lin Ming couldn't help but cough. Li Yan smiled. "What's wrong, not used to it?"

"Yes, yes, I don't smoke much in the Ming. The court has banned it..."

"This is not the court's territory. You can smoke as you please," Li Yan said, studying the man before him—haggard, gray-faced, looking as if a gust of wind could blow him over. And this man had five wives? And was after his sister-in-law? If it weren't for the intelligence provided by Liu San confirming it, he would have thought Lin Ming was bragging.
