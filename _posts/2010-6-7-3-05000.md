The maidservant rushed in, her shiny scalp glistening in the candlelight. But for Chang Shide, who hadn't been with a woman for half a year and was brimming with hormones, this was not an issue. He grabbed A'Xiu and began to pull at her clothes. Fortunately, the garment was only fastened with a belt. A single pull was enough to make it fall away, revealing, of course, no undergarments. Chang Shide's hands roamed freely, enjoying himself immensely. A'Xiu was clearly not an inexperienced virgin. She soon began to pant under his caresses, collapsing onto the bed. Chang Shide immediately mounted her. Eager to please her master, A'Xiu writhed and catered to his every need, moaning to enhance the atmosphere. Chang Shide, having been deprived for so long, quickly surrendered. The immense energy that had been building up inside him for seven or eight months erupted! In just two or three minutes, his recovery rate was 120%! He was immediately ready for another round. After a few more rounds, A'Xiu began to tire. Seeing the woman beneath him moving less and less, Chang Shide, still not fully satisfied, finally finished. Though her body was sore and weak, A'Xiu managed to prop herself up, fetch water from the outer room to clean him, and tidy herself up before leaving.

The old-fashioned house had poor sound insulation. The commotion kept all the men in the courtyard awake. The younger men were particularly agitated, forcing Zhou Shizhai to repeatedly tell Li Biao to go back to sleep and stop running around the courtyard.

"This is how a man should live," Chang Shide thought with satisfaction, sprawled on the bed, his body feeling as if it were floating on clouds. "I should teach this woman some new tricks when I have time, especially new positions. And I should get some sexy underwear. This all-natural look is a bit boring, and her breasts will sag. As for the other two, I need to properly train them after I've had them. In the future, I'll expand my collection of women, add some new ones—it would be great if I could add a few Westerners..."

The next morning, Chang Shide woke up early, feeling that the sky had never been so clear and the air never so fresh. Standing under the eaves, he greeted everyone who passed with enthusiasm, feeling full of youthful vitality.

"Old Wen, why are your eyes so dark?" Chang Shide asked, looking at Wen Tong, who was yawning as he walked past on his way to the sugar factory.

"How could I sleep with you howling like a wolf all night?" Wen Tong was clearly annoyed.

"I know, I know," Chang Shide apologized sincerely. "Old Wen, do you want me to have A'Zhu serve you tonight..."

"I don't have the energy for that," Wen Tong replied evasively, though he had been thinking about it. He quickly slipped away.

Wen Tong arrived at the sugar factory office. Looking at the reports sent from the various sugarcane plantations, he struggled to decipher the crookedly written and not-so-fluent classical vernacular. He had to ask Wen Qing to help him with the paperwork. The lack of cadres was their biggest headache. Chang Shide was not satisfied with the village committee cadres at any of the plantations.

The reports from various locations indicated that more than half of the sugarcane in the fields had been harvested, and the production of raw sugar was proceeding smoothly. However, being a landlord in this unfamiliar place was quite difficult. From the situation over the past month, Wen Tong had a vague feeling that something was wrong. At the beginning, the manager of a local sugar mill had repeatedly reported that the sugar master's skills were poor, resulting in a daily loss of a certain amount of sugarcane juice, which had to be discarded. The amount was so large that it accounted for nearly one-fifth of the daily juice extraction. Wen Tong knew that no matter how poor the master's skills were, it couldn't be that bad. He had the escort agency investigate secretly and found that the manager and the sugar master were colluding to embezzle twenty to thirty kilograms of raw sugar every day. This infuriated him. Wen Tong knew that this was unlikely to be an isolated incident. He immediately informed Liao Dahua and asked him to dispatch shrewd and capable escorts to investigate secretly. As expected, this kind of cheating was happening almost everywhere except for the South China Sugar Factory, the only difference being the amount. Even the newly arrived indentured servants from Guangzhou had joined in. They couldn't get their hands on the sugar production, but they could cheat with the sugarcane. The village chief, deputy chief, and militia captain of one plantation colluded to sell sugarcane on the side. They underreported the yield by more than 7,000 standard jin per mu, reporting less than 5,000 jin.

If this continued, the situation would become serious. Greed is a contagious disease. If not treated quickly, it will soon become a frenzy. The big shots steal big, the small fry steal small, and those who dare not steal will slack off. Once morale collapses, the sugar company will be hollowed out by these parasites before it even gets big. Wen Tong had originally planned not to make any institutional changes in the first year, turning a blind eye to some of the shortcomings. He wanted to focus on the sugar industry first and deal with the problems slowly after the harvest season. But the current situation made it impossible for him to tolerate it any longer.

"What do people learn the fastest? Corruption!" Chang Shide, who had been called in by Wen Tong to discuss countermeasures, couldn't help but swear, filled with righteous indignation, completely forgetting his own abuse of public funds for private gain the day before.

"Let's think of something," Wen Tong was very worried about this matter. "There are no reliable people in this sugar company. Even if we count the Wen brothers, the maids, and the female slaves you bought yesterday, there are no more than ten people in total."

"Aren't there still the Qiwei escorts?"

"The Qiwei escorts are reliable, but they are martial artists and don't understand the sugar industry. These are just the problems that are on the surface. Who knows how many problems there are in the dark."

This place was different from Lingao. If Lingao was a liberated zone, Leizhou was at most a guerrilla zone. Their power in Leizhou was very small, and their prestige was zero, not enough to deter the new immigrants and the local natives. Not to mention that the tendency to view foreign investors as fat sheep was still prevalent even in the 21st century. If it weren't for Qiwei having entered a few months in advance and paving the way with various resources, things would probably be even more troublesome.

"We must ask Lingao for cadres. People from Du Wen's workshop or the National School's military and political cadre training class will do. At least we need to fill the grassroots..."

"Wouldn't that make us look too incompetent?" Chang Shide disagreed. "Old Wen, we've just opened up the situation, and we're already crying and begging the Executive Committee for help. How will we manage in the future? Besides, the Executive Committee doesn't have enough cadres for itself."

"This—" Wen Tong thought that was indeed the case. "What do you want to do?"

Chang Shide said, "I have a plan. To put it bluntly, it's just a combination of carrots and sticks. The key is to win the loyalty of the immigrants, as they are our future basic force. As for the workers in the sugar mills, they should also be treated differently. We should crack down on a small group and win over the majority."

"Isn't that just empty talk?" Wen Tong was disappointed.

"First, we need to establish a sound wage and welfare system. Second, we need to severely punish the ringleaders." Chang Shide's approach was simple. If you want employees not to steal, they must have a sense of ownership. They didn't have the ability to fool the people of the Ming Dynasty into believing that the Leizhou Sugar Company was the property of the broad masses of the people, making them work hard and shed their blood and sweat. But at least they could increase their sense of identification by letting the employees share in the profits.

"The first part is easy to say, but how do we severely punish the corrupt elements? Fire them and drive them away?" Wen Tong thought that Lingao had the police, a labor re-education team, and a new army armed to the teeth, a complete set of violent machinery. They had no other power besides the dozen or so escorts from the Qiwei Escort Agency's Leizhou branch—and the escorts had no law enforcement authority.

"Firing them and driving them away probably won't have much deterrent effect. Besides, the Executive Committee has spent a lot of money on the immigrants—" Chang Shide thought. "It would be best to make an example of someone." He thought for a moment. "Let's ask Liao Dahua first. He's a local, after all. Maybe he has a way."

So they sent for Liao Dahua. After hearing their story, Liao Dahua smiled. "This is easy. Isn't Patron Guo on good terms with Aide-de-camp Lü? He's a favorite of Governor-general Wang. We can just spend some silver to get a letter from him and have the government make an example of someone."

This was indeed a solution. Locally, the authority of the government was paramount. If they could get the government involved, it would be a deterrent to the local troublemakers. The two of them looked at each other and nodded.

"Is it troublesome?"

"Not at all," Liao Dahua said. "It just depends on how big you want to make it. If you want to take a few lives—"

Wen Tong quickly said, "It doesn't have to go that far, but it can't be too light either."

"Then it's easy. It's just that government officials are never easy to deal with—they only recognize silver. With a letter, they'll naturally do the job, but if you want it done well, you have to spend money. It will cost over a hundred taels of silver for all the connections. And the tricky part is that it involves another county. We'll have to bribe the officials in Haikang as well."

This was an expense of two to three hundred taels. They had the money and the authority to use it, but it was a large sum, and both Wen Tong and Chang Shide were a bit unsure. In the end, it was Chang Shide who gritted his teeth and said, "Let's do it!"

Wen Tong thought that as long as they could rectify the situation and get the sugar production back on track, they could easily make a few thousand taels of silver this harvest season. In comparison, it was worth it. He also agreed.

The three of them discussed the specific operation. Wen Tong had the escorts investigate further to get solid evidence. Liao Dahua said that since they were involving the government, they didn't need any evidence at all. The charges would depend on how much silver they paid. If they were ruthless, it wouldn't be difficult to frame them for colluding with pirates. But Wen Tong insisted on having solid evidence. Liao Dahua agreed.

A few days later, four yamen runners from Xuwen County were dispatched. They set out with Chang Shide and the escorts and first arrested the managers and village cadres of the two plantations in the county who had embezzled the most and often defied his instructions, taking them to the county yamen. Because they had bribed all the necessary officials, the matter was handled very quickly. It was an eye-opener for Wen Tong; his evidence was useless. As soon as the prisoners arrived, the assistant magistrate held court. Without any interrogation, he immediately convicted them of "theft." The tally sticks were thrown down, and the prisoners were given eighty and one hundred strokes of the cane respectively. Liao Dahua, knowing that the manager wanted to make an example of them, had bribed the yamen runners who administered the beatings. They showed no mercy, and the hall was filled with the sounds of flesh being torn and blood-curdling screams. Chang Shide had the managers, workers, and village cadres from all the plantations brought to the yamen to watch. The timid ones didn't even dare to look, and some wet their pants on the spot.

After the beating, the indentured servants were returned to their original masters for re-education. The others were put in the cangue for a month before being released.

Wen Tong didn't even dare to be present. Chang Shide watched the whole thing with a cold face, but he regretted it in his heart. As a modern man, he was not used to such cruel scenes.

But he had to admit that it was very effective. When he arrived at the other plantations with the yamen runners and demanded that those with problems "confess for lenient treatment," the people, who had been terrified by the news, flocked to him to hand over their ill-gotten gains.

A few days later, Chang Shide toured the plantations in Haikang County with the yamen runners from Haikang. This time, he gave everyone a chance to "reform themselves." The menacing yamen runners, with their clanking iron chains, struck fear into the hearts of the corrupt. They immediately and obediently handed over their loot to seek "lenient treatment." As for those who thought they could get away with it, they were dealt with in the same way as in Xuwen County. After paying the yamen runners for their services and sending gifts to the magistrate's secretary, the bloody spectacle of "killing the chicken to scare the monkey" finally came to an end. Wen Tong and Chang Shide returned to the South China Factory, not saying a word on the way. The job was done, but the whole process left the two modern men with a bad taste in their mouths.

"Actually," Wen Tong said, "I think our original time was somewhat lawful."

"Yeah, today I finally understood what it means to be a real 'commoner'," Chang Shide agreed.

With the matter settled, Chang Shide dismissed all the managers, regardless of the severity of their offenses. He and Wen Tong had already decided that in the future, all such cadres would be selected from among the immigrants. Then, he ordered all the village representatives from the plantations, the workers from the sugar factories, and all the employees of the South China Factory to a meeting.

Looking at the courtyard filled with a sea of black heads, Chang Shide walked up the steps. His words were simultaneously translated by Liao Dahua and Wen Xiu.

"Most of the people here came from the refugee camps in Guangzhou. Before you entered the camps, you all remember what kind of life you lived, right? I don't need to tell you how many people die on the streets of Guangzhou every day. The great manager of the Zicheng Firm took you all in, gave you food and drink, treated you when you were sick, and gave you new clothes, cups, and bowls. You were never allowed to go hungry. Now that you've come to Leizhou, the conditions are not as good as in Guangzhou, but you get three full meals a day. Even your children and the elderly can eat as much as they want. Ask yourselves, in this day and age, how many masters can do this?"

"Although you have all signed contracts, and according to the rules, we only need to feed you and keep you from starving for these seven years, the sugar factory still pays you wages. Regardless of whether you are a man, woman, old, or young, as long as you go to work, you will be paid. You can ask around at the surrounding plantations about the wages and food. See what kind of treatment the long-term and short-term laborers of other families get."

"You've all heard the saying: 'Pies don't fall from the sky.' Neither the Zicheng Firm nor our South China Sugar Factory are charities. We give you good food and drink so that you will work. You have eaten our food, worn our clothes, and taken our wages, so you must work hard."
