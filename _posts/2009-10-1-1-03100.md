"Rescue a hostage?" Sun Kecheng, the old master of the Qiwei Escort Agency, narrowed his eyes. He scrutinized Sun Chang, the young man who had come seeking his aid.

Sun Chang was technically his martial nephew, a distant relative, but his blunt nature had won him few allies. He now worked as a servant in Guangzhou, a fate Sun Kecheng often bemoaned as a profound waste of his martial talents.

The master had entertained the thought of bringing him into the agency, but fortunes had turned. Business was a shadow of its former self. An escort agency was not a common enterprise where another man simply meant another mouth to feed. Here, every individual played a crucial part. You hired when the roads were busy and coffers were full; more men meant more expenses, and the margins were already thin. When trade was slow, you couldn't simply dismiss your people. You endured together, tightening belts and weathering the storm. In these lean times, taking on a new hand was out of the question.

"Indeed. My master invites you, honored sir, to discuss the matter."

A flicker of confusion crossed Sun Kecheng's face. He knew Sun Chang served the wealthy merchant Gao Ju on Haopan Street, a man whose influence reached every corner of Guangzhou. If bandits were the problem, why not involve the authorities? Why turn to a humble escort agency?

Hostage rescue was a messy business, one that agencies like his studiously avoided. Their survival depended on a delicate dance with the underworld, a relationship governed by the principle of "harmony above all." They were negotiators, not warriors, preferring to "make friends" rather than engage in bloody conflict. To rescue a hostage was to steal a meal from a wolf's jaws. The sort of criminals audacious enough to stage a kidnapping in the provincial capital were not common ruffians. A confrontation was inevitable, and win or lose, revealing the agency's hand would create a formidable and lasting enemy.

Yet, the agency was in dire straits. Since the first year of the Tianqi Emperor's reign, the land had descended into chaos. The escort routes grew more treacherous by the day, their income had slowed to a trickle, and over a hundred souls depended on him for their livelihood.

After long deliberation, he resolved to take the commission. The offered sum would be a lifeline, easing the agency's financial burdens. But there was more to it. His nephew had spoken of his new masters: Australian sea merchants. The name resonated with Sun Kecheng. Australian wares were the talk of the town, prized for their quality. These merchants were not only fabulously wealthy but also, it seemed, men of character. They had been generous to Sun Chang, even permitting him to use his family name once more. Such an act spoke of integrity. For the sake of both honor and obligation, he knew he must lend his aid.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] and Ran Yao exchanged skeptical glances as they appraised the man Sun Chang had so effusively praised. They had envisioned a towering, bearded figure, a hero lifted from the pages of a wuxia epic. Before them stood a middle-aged man in a simple silk cap and a commoner's shirt, indistinguishable from any elder one might pass on the street. His gait was firm, his posture composed, yet he radiated none of the aura of a fabled martial artist.

Still, their options were limited, and their need for local intelligence was acute. Gao Di and the children had already ventured out, but they could not rest their hopes on the efforts of a few youths alone. They laid out the situation for the agency master, detailing the kidnapping and the findings of their initial reconnaissance.

Sun Kecheng listened intently to [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s account, nodding as he absorbed the details of their investigation.

"You have some remarkably resourceful men, masters," he said, a note of genuine respect in his voice.

"We are foreigners here, Master Sun," [Xiao Zishan][y001] replied. "We are ignorant of the city's intricate ways. We must depend on your guidance."

"But of course," Sun Kecheng said with an affable nod. "The honor you've shown my nephew is more than enough. For that alone, the Qiwei Escort Agency pledges its full support."

"Then what is your assessment of the situation?"

"As Master Ran has already observed, one of the culprits was barefoot. In Guangzhou, even the poorest peasant from the countryside wears straw sandals or wooden clogs in the city. The only folk who go without shoes year-round are the Dan people."

"The Dan people?" The name stirred a vague memory in [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s mind—something about a class of outcasts from a bygone era.

"The very same. You are not familiar with them?" Sun Kecheng elaborated. The Dan, he explained, were the "boat households," a people who lived their entire lives upon the water, inhabiting the coastal bays and inland rivers of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. "They are born on boats, they die on boats. They make their living from the water and are said to be able to read the presence of dragons in its color. In olden times, they were known as 'dragon households,' but the common folk just call them the Dan."

"So they are fishermen?"

"Some are, yes, but not all fishermen are Dan," Sun Kecheng clarified. The Dan were a world unto themselves, their boats plying every manner of trade in every harbor and along every tributary of the Pearl River.

If the Dan were involved, the picture sharpened considerably. It was almost certain that [Director Wen][y002] was being held captive on a boat. Their location in the southern district was just a stone's throw from the Pearl River. Once on the water, the kidnappers could vanish. Worse, the Dan were a notoriously insular people, with their own dialect and customs, deeply suspicious of those from the land. Prying information from them would be nearly impossible for an outsider.

A chill settled over the room. The implications were grim.

"There must be tens of thousands of boats on that river," Ran Yao said, his voice laced with frustration. "It would take a month to search them all." For a moment, he forgot that they had no authority to search anything in this era.

"Do not lose heart, masters," Sun Kecheng advised. "The task is not as daunting as it appears. The Dan are clannish and wary of outsiders, but they are not the sort to orchestrate a kidnapping of this nature. It is far more likely that land-based bandits have formed an alliance with the operators of the 'flower boats.' These pleasure craft are notorious hubs for illicit dealings. The type of incense used to incapacitate your friend is not a common tool for bandits, but it is a favored trick of the women on those boats to relieve their clients of their valuables."

A confident smile touched his lips. "I am willing to wager that [Master Wen][y002] is being held on one of those very boats."

"And where are these flower boats?"

"The majority are moored in the White Goose Pool, near Shicui Isle. I will dispatch my men to begin inquiries immediately. But first, there are several things I must impress upon you. There are certain actions you must not take, under any circumstances."

"First, do not go to the authorities. A word from Master Gao could indeed mobilize the constabulary of the entire prefecture, but those men are a corrupt lot. A 'fat sheep,' as they say, has fallen into their lap. They will not act without a handsome payment of silver, and it's just as likely they would collude with the kidnappers to share the spoils."

"Second, when a messenger arrives with a ransom demand, do not attempt to seize him. These couriers are typically beggars or street ruffians, hired for a pittance. They know nothing of the men who employed them. Capturing one would be a futile gesture that would only serve to alarm our adversaries."

"And finally, do not be hasty. The kidnappers will have eyes on this residence, I assure you. But these lookouts are also hired hands. They will know little of value."

After seeing Master Sun out, the group reconvened. They could not afford to simply wait. The kidnappers wanted a ransom, which meant they would have to make contact. That contact would be a thread, a trail they could follow. While they couldn't deploy a GPS tracker in Ming Dynasty Guangzhou, their own surveillance technology was another matter entirely.

They moved quickly. Cameras were positioned around the courtyard, feeding into a makeshift monitoring station powered by a bank of batteries for round-the-clock observation. Lin Shenhe took a stroll through the neighborhood, discreetly placing several wireless cameras on the rooftops overlooking the street. Back at the residence, he donned a camouflage suit. Armed with binoculars, a night-vision scope, a walkie-talkie, and a rifle, he scaled the large tree in the courtyard. Hidden within its dense canopy, he established a small observation post, where he and Bei Wei would stand watch in shifts, a silent, unseen guardian ready to react.

Meanwhile, Ran Yao, disguised as a servant and concealing a small digital camera, followed Sun Chang on a tour of Haopan Street.

"I've found them," he announced upon his return, setting the camera on the table. A surge of energy went through the room as everyone gathered to see.

"Four of them, total," Ran Yao explained, playing the footage. "See this street vendor? He's barely tending his stall. His eyes keep darting back to the main entrance of the Gao residence."

He pointed to another figure. "This one's dressed as a beggar, but he isn't working the busy street. He's lurking in the quiet alley by the side gate."

He indicated two more. "One watching the front gate from across the way. And this one," he paused on a man sitting alone in the teahouse, "this is likely their leader. He’s too calm, too observant. They probably have a runner or two as well. We need to get photos of these faces into everyone's hands."

"Agreed."

"Should we try to snatch one?" Bei Wei asked.

"Pointless," Ran Yao countered. "They're hired muscle, low-level. They won't know anything."

"If we could just follow the leader," Lin Shenhe mused from the doorway. "He has to report to his superiors eventually."

"Too risky. We don't have the local knowledge to tail someone without being spotted."

"What about a wireless beacon?"

"Better to plant it with the ransom money," [Xiao Zishan][y001] suggested. "Let them lead us right to their den."

"Theoretically," Bei Wei interjected. "But without GPS or a decent map, we can't get a precise location from the signal. We'd have to rely on radio direction finding, which only gives a general bearing. In a city this dense, it's a crapshoot."

"The map is the crux of the problem," Ran Yao sighed.

"Aren't there maps from this period? We should buy some."

"Sun Chang already did. It's... impressionistic, to say the least." The crude woodblock print was a far cry from a modern topographical survey.

"Still, it's a lead," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said. "Bei Wei, you know how to handle the direction finder?"

"I do."

"Good. You're on point when the time comes."

"The ideal scenario is we find his location and mount a direct rescue," Ran Yao said.

"Patience. Master Sun seemed confident he could locate him within a few days."

A silence fell over the group, each lost in their own thoughts. Finally, [Xiao Zishan][y001] voiced what was on everyone's mind. "I just hope [Director Wen][y002] is alright."

Back at the Qiwei Escort Agency, Sun Kecheng drank several pots of strong tea, his mind racing. He had projected an air of utter confidence for the Australians, and in truth, he was reasonably certain of his theory. The involvement of the flower boats was almost a given. Even without the clue of the barefoot man, the lingering scent in the victim's room was enough to point him in that direction. The challenge was the investigation itself. The agency's code of conduct strictly prohibited its members from frequenting such establishments. His men were strangers in that world.

Fortunately, even the floating world had to eat. The flower boats depended on land-based merchants for their provisions. Sun Kecheng knew he could glean information from the vendors who supplied them. An extra person on a small boat, after all, would leave a trace—an increase in the demand for food and supplies.

He summoned his most trusted men and divided them into two teams. The first would pose as itinerant peddlers, making discreet inquiries. The second would leverage their relationships with familiar vendors. He laid out the plan, adding one final, crucial instruction:

"I want to know if any boat has been recently chartered for exclusive use, or if one has abruptly stopped receiving clients. Pay attention."

The flower boats were not large vessels. It would be impossible to conceal a captive while conducting business as usual.

Once they found the location, the rescue itself should be straightforward. Sun Kecheng had experience in these matters, having recovered hostages for clients in the past. He knew the kidnappers rarely stayed with their victim. The guards were typically hired thugs, easily dealt with. This arrangement served two purposes: it prevented the victim from identifying the ringleaders, and it ensured the masterminds were elsewhere if the authorities ever staged a raid.

He remembered the parting words of the Australian, Ran Yao. The agency's role was to gather intelligence. The final move would be theirs to make.
