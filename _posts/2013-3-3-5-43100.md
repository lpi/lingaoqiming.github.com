Shen Tingyang was delighted to see that he was very interested in seafaring and spoke like an expert. In those days, few scholars were interested in such matters, and he couldn't help but feel he had found a kindred spirit.

When they talked about the northern sea route, Shen Tingyang said that it had always been in operation. However, due to the sea ban and the influence of Japanese pirates, not many people sailed it. It wasn't until the Longqing era that sand ships sailing the northern route began to flourish.

The northern sea route started from Shanghai, exited the Wusong estuary, sailed east to Sheshan, then headed north to Tiechashan. After reaching Chengshan, it turned west towards Zhifu Island, and then a little further north, it reached Tianjin. The total water journey was four thousand li.

In general, it still followed the compass directions, using maritime landmarks to navigate along the coastline in a zigzagging manner. Therefore, even with a favorable wind, it took ten days to sail. Including the time spent waiting for the wind, a one-way trip took about fifteen days. Adding the time for loading and unloading cargo, a round trip took about forty days. By modern standards, this was quite slow, but compared to the canal boats, which often took several months for a single journey, it was still highly efficient.

Zhao Yingong calculated in his mind that if he provided navigators and modern nautical charts, there should be a significant reduction in mileage and speed—the modern Shanghai-Tianjin route was only 1300 kilometers—and efficiency could be greatly improved.

"Nowadays, the business in the north is getting worse and worse," Shen Tingyang said after a few more drinks. Being a straightforward person, he couldn't help but speak the truth after drinking. "The capital has been ravaged by the Tartars, there are famines everywhere, and with the chaos of war, business is very difficult to do."

Fortunately, as the capital, Beijing continued to concentrate the consumption power of the entire country. The extravagant lifestyles of the high officials and nobles were not affected by the chaos outside the city walls. This was what allowed the Shen family's north-south goods business to continue.

However, even so, his family had a few too many sand ships, and they were not fully utilized. They had over a hundred of the largest sand ships alone, not counting the small and medium-sized ones. So, some of the ships had been diverted to the Yangtze River route, doing business between Shanghai, Wuchang, and Hankou.

"Doing business on the Yangtze is not easy either. Not to mention the river pirates, there are also brokers at the docks causing trouble. Now I've told my managers to only transport goods and not to trade, to avoid all this endless trouble."

"If the tribute grain could be transported by sea, wouldn't Brother Jiming make a huge fortune?" Zhao Yingong complimented.

"Not at all, not at all. Although Brother Tianru is willing to step forward, the chances of this matter succeeding are only one in ten. If we can get the Taicang white grain transported by sea, I would be more than satisfied," Shen Tingyang said, shaking his head.

"So, if the court were to relent on this matter, Brother Jiming would definitely do his utmost?"

"Of course!" Shen Tingyang said firmly. "This is something that would be of great benefit to the country, the people, and myself. I must serve." He smiled. "To be honest with you, brother, I have been planning this for several years, so I have studied the sea transport maps and books of the previous dynasty over and over again. If you want me to transport grain, I'm not boasting, I can prepare a hundred large ships and transport three to four hundred thousand shi of tribute grain at once. The entire Jiangnan's tribute grain of over a million shi could be transported in three round trips. Why would we need thousands of tribute boats and tens of thousands of boatmen and grain chiefs to serve!"

At this point, he was filled with heroic spirit and couldn't help but comment on the current situation: "Take the grain and provisions for Guan-Ning. Nowadays, they are first shipped from Tianjin to Dengzhou, and then from Dengzhou, they wait for the wind to transport them to Guan-Ning. If I were to transport them, why would it be so complicated? I would ship them directly from Tianjin! How much manpower and resources would be saved! I'm not bragging, but if the court could contract both the tribute grain and the Guan-Ning military transport to me, it would save at least half the cost!"

Zhao Yingong nodded frequently, thinking to himself, "More than half! If the shipping company under the Senate were to transport it, it wouldn't even cost a tenth."

If it weren't for the tight transport capacity and the need for a legal front to approach and solicit business on shore, there would be no need to contact you at all.

"Brother Jiming is truly bold!" Zhao Yingong said with a smile. "It's just that matters of the court can only be handled with meticulous effort and can't be rushed."

"Of course, of course," Shen Tingyang said with a smile. "If this matter can be accomplished, what do you plan to do in the future, brother?"

Zhao Yingong thought that this was the moment to feel out the terms of cooperation. The plans for how each party would invest and share the profits had to be laid out here.

He had considered this many times and had also asked the Great Library for reference. Generally speaking, there was no need for profit sharing with Zhang Pu, because Zhang Pu's main motivation was to "relieve the hardship" of the grain households in his hometown of Taicang. As long as it was done, he would score points. The Xu Guangqi family was just a tiger skin he was borrowing; donating some silver to the church in Shanghai as a fellow Christian would be enough. The real profit sharing was between the Senate and Shen Tingyang.

But on the surface, he still had to fly the banner of the Xu Guangqi family. So he proposed a plan: the two parties would establish a joint venture shipping company, jointly funded by the Shen family and Zhao Yingong—the Shen family could use their ships as a contribution in kind for their shares.

The total share capital was set at thirty thousand taels. The Shen family would contribute ten thousand taels, Zhao Yingong would contribute ten thousand taels, and the remaining ten thousand taels would be open to public investment, with each share being one hundred taels. Shen Tingyang thought to himself that his so-called ten thousand taels and the ten thousand taels for public investment undoubtedly included shares from Grand Secretary Xu or the leaders of the Restoration Society. It was just that these people couldn't come forward, so they came up with the "public investment" gimmick.

In fact, the public investment was not a fiction. Zhao Yingong was indeed preparing to solicit investment in Jiangnan—this was the concentration of wealth in the Ming Dynasty, and it would be a shame not to dig out some of the silver hoarded by the old moneybags.

"The share capital is easy to talk about, but I wonder where the company should be located?" Shen Tingyang asked. "I have many properties in Chongming, I can just set aside a few rooms. It's also easy for the ships to dock..."

Zhao Yingong shook his head. "Jiangnan is a land of water. The grain households all use small boats to transport their grain. If it's transported to Chongming, the small boats can't withstand the waves of the great river, and it adds another layer of transshipment costs. It's better to set up a warehouse in Shanghai county town to receive the grain."

Shen Tingyang thought that made sense. Besides, Grand Secretary Xu's family was in Shanghai, and he was the top gentry in Shanghai. Neither official nor private parties would dare to provoke him. He was indeed a good umbrella of protection—you had to know that once the Taicang white grain was approved for sea transport, it would offend countless ruffians and scoundrels who lived off the river. Having this protection would be much better.

"I just don't know when this can be accomplished," Shen Tingyang sighed. If this matter failed, all these plans would come to nothing.

Zhao Yingong felt that the time was right and said, "Once the company is established, we won't have to worry about not having business to do. I've heard that the sea trade with Japan is very profitable. I wonder if Brother Jiming has ever thought about it?"

Shen Tingyang was taken aback. He suddenly remembered that the other party had an Australian background. For a moment, he didn't know what the other party's intentions were and could only say vaguely, "Sand ships have never sailed to foreign lands, and we have no compass directions for them." He took another sip of wine and pondered, "It's not that I haven't thought about it. I have thousands of brothers to feed, but going to Japan is still unfamiliar territory..."

The Shen family was the overlord of the northern sea route and was also well-established on the Yangtze River. But their sand ships did not enter the Grand Canal, nor did they go south to Fujian and Guangdong. Although this was not a written rule, it was an "unspoken rule." The trade route to Japan had always been operated by the sea lords of Fujian. Although merchants from Nan-Zhili could go to Japan to do business as long as they were willing to pay Zheng Zhilong for a flag, he, on the one hand, had no pilots familiar with the sea routes, and on the other hand, he didn't know how many connections he would have to make, so he didn't dare to venture into it rashly.

Shen Tingyang said, "This is not a business for ordinary people. I've heard that for a big business trip to Japan, just preparing a large ship and a full cargo would require at least ten thousand taels of silver. If you encounter pirates or a big storm on the way, that ten thousand taels would be gone."

Small merchants didn't need that much; they could go to sea with a few hundred taels of goods. But in the eyes of people at the time, this was a gamble with one's life. Although Shen Tingyang's horizons were much broader than the average person's, people's thinking is hard to separate from their era. For him, doing business in Japan was a very risky venture.

He pondered: Zhao Yingong's words seemed to indicate that he had the idea of getting involved in the trade with Japan, and he brought it up with him because he was interested in his sand ships—but trade with Japan was not something that could be done just by having ships.

Zhao Yingong said in a deep voice, "To be honest with you, Master Shen, I have been going to sea with ships for trade since I was young and have made friends with some overseas merchants. I am also familiar with the sea routes. Especially since I have obtained a secret navigation method from the Australians, I can navigate long distances by observing the sky and measuring my position without needing compass directions. Starting from Shanghai, taking the fastest sea route, it would take me only ten days to reach Japan. As for the money, I can afford it."

Shen Tingyang was half-convinced. He knew that Westerners used a method of observing the sky for navigation instead of compass directions, and they could plot a course in the vast ocean. He had never seen it with his own eyes, though. It wouldn't be surprising if Zhao Yingong knew it, but his claim that he had the fastest sea route and could reach Japan in ten days was a bit of a boast.

He had heard that to go to Japan, one must set sail from Fujian, otherwise the compass directions would be useless. Could it be that this Master Zhao had another route? If so, wouldn't this Master Zhao be holding a huge, unprecedented path to wealth? This was too incredible to believe!

Thinking of this, he carefully observed Zhao Yingong's face and eyes, looking for any sign of deceit. However, the other party was both calm and confident, not seeming to be fraudulent.

Zhao Yingong knew what he was thinking and smiled, "I know Brother Jiming probably doesn't believe it..."

"It's not that I don't believe it, it's just too—" Shen Tingyang searched for the right word.

"Incredible."

"That's a strong word! A strong word!"

Zhao Yingong smiled and proposed a plan: he would rent four large sand ships from the Shen family, including the sailors, and he would fund the trade with Japan himself.

"As for the rent, Brother Jiming, feel free to name your price."

Shen Tingyang studied him for a moment and said decisively, "What are you talking about, brother? I won't take a single copper for the ship rent. But this trip to Japan, you have to count me in for a share."
