After the inspection was complete, they returned to the main hall. Gao Qing presented the household inventory ledger. [Xiao Zishan][y001] didn't look at it much and simply accepted it. The three men gathered around the table and began to draw a rough sketch. [Wang Luobin][y003] had studied drafting, and although he only had a notebook and a ballpoint pen, drawing a rough floor plan of the building was a piece of cake for him.

"[Zishan][y001], you're quite the cheapskate," [Wang Luobin][y003] said as he drew. "Still concerned about this little bit of cured meat and rice? It's not easy for them to support a family. Just give it to them and be done with it. It would also increase their loyalty..."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] laughed: "[Engineer Wang][y003], the gift list includes forty shi of rice alone. At the rice prices of the late Tianqi era, that's forty taels of silver."

"So what? Are you thinking of selling the rice for silver?"

"Forty taels of silver is equivalent to four years' wages for Gao Qing and his wife. If we give away forty taels right now, how much would be appropriate to reward them with in the future?"

"If we give too much, their expectations will be higher in the future. Is that what you mean?" [Wen Desi][y002] said.

"Exactly, [Chief Wen][y002]." [Xiao Zishan][y001] nodded. "The Gao family is indeed having a hard time, but they are getting by for now. And we don't know his background yet, so there's no need to rush to be a good person and buy his loyalty." He lowered his voice, "I'm certain that Master Gao has definitely instructed him to pay attention to our movements."

"Yes, that's very likely."

"So it's still difficult for us to try to win him over now. He doesn't understand us, and he's even more afraid that we might have some bad intentions. Besides, he has only just met us. He has no merits and has done no hard work. If we give him so many things at once, what will he think? He will definitely report it to Master Gao immediately. In the end, we will have given away things for nothing and gained no favor."

"That's true. But it would be best if we could win him over."

"Favors must be given, but they can only be small favors, gradually letting him feel our benefits. Over time, he will naturally be inclined towards us. And he is not Master Gao's confidant, so it will be easier to win him over."

"Not a confidant? This residence is a place for Master Gao to use in case of emergency. How could the caretaker not be a confidant?"

"Didn't you hear him say? He was only assigned here less than half a month ago. And a true confidant, Master Gao would not give to us."

"Maybe he said that on purpose. Maybe everything he said was fabricated?"

"That's also possible. But from my observation, I don't think so. Gao Qing has a look of sorrow on his face, his expression is dull, and his eyes are vacant. He is not a shrewd and capable person." [Xiao Zishan][y001] glanced outside. "To take a step back, Master Gao's attitude towards us is nothing more than prevention and utilization, with utilization being the main thing. So it's unlikely that he would invest too much in monitoring us."

"Then what do you plan to do?"

"We still have to give some small favors. What do you think of this arrangement..."

As they were talking, Mrs. Gao came to ask how to arrange dinner. [Xiao Zishan][y001] looked at his watch and realized it was already four in the afternoon.

"No need for dinner. Call your whole family over."

"Actually, I'd quite like to taste what the food of the Ming Dynasty is like," [Wang Luobin][y003] said with a look of longing.

"It's said to be very heavy on spices..."

As they were talking, the whole family arrived. Mrs. Gao had regular features, but she was dark and thin, and kept her head down without speaking. She seemed to be a person of few words. Looking at the pair of children, the boy had ordinary features, but his eyes had not yet lost their lively sparkle. Although he put on a serious expression, he was always secretly sizing them up. The girl, however, was very different from the rest of the family. Her skin was much fairer than her family's, her eyes were large, her nose was small and straight, and she was even taller than the boy. [Xiao Zishan][y001] estimated she was over 1.6 meters tall, and couldn't help but feel a secret doubt. He asked:

"What is your name?"

The girl didn't expect to be asked first. She looked at [Xiao Zishan][y001] in surprise and stammered, unable to speak.

"The master is asking you a question!" Gao Qing shouted, then bowed and reported, "The girl has not seen the world, she has no formal name..."

"Let her speak for herself. You are her father. You can stand in for her for a while, but can you stand in for her for a lifetime?"

"This servant... um... is called Gao Dajie..."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] almost spat out the tea in his mouth. [Engineer Wang][y003] and [Chief Wen][y002] also looked like they were trying hard not to laugh. Gao Dajie (Gao Big Sister), what a grand name. Now that she said it, looking closely, the girl did have a bit of Michelle Yeoh's slender, long-legged look.

The Gao family all stared dumbfounded at their new masters, unable to figure out what was so funny about this name.

Gao Qing said with an apologetic smile, "I have made a fool of myself in front of the masters... a country girl, she was never given a proper name..."

"It's nothing, it's nothing," [Xiao Zishan][y001] laughed. "Since you don't have a name, let's give you one." His mischievous streak emerged: "Let's call you Gao Lujie (Colgate)."

[Wen Desi][y002]: "Our goal?"

[Wang Luobin][y003]: "No cavities!"

The three of them, forgetting their image, burst into wild laughter.

The Gao family, seeing these three men laughing like mad ever since they learned their daughter's name, couldn't help but feel afraid, and could only stand aside and force a smile.

[Wen Desi][y002] thought that this girl was a beauty in the making by modern standards, but people in the Ming Dynasty didn't like this type of woman. It was a pity that her figure was still a bit thin, and her assets were limited. He wondered if she could be improved with good nourishment.

"How old is this girl?"

"Re... replying to master," Gao Qing's words were faltering. This [Master Wen][y002]'s eyes were wandering, circling around his daughter. He had a bad feeling. "Four... fourteen."

Fourteen? A standard little loli. It was a pity that there were many important things to do at the moment, and he had no time to train a loli.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] had practiced calligraphy for a few days as a child and had not forgotten how to write traditional characters. He found a piece of rough-edged accounting paper and wrote the three characters "Gao Lujie" in large script, thus giving her a name.

"Thank you, master, for bestowing a name." Gao Qing led his daughter to kowtow in thanks.

"Get up, get up. Since we are master and servant, we are one family. There is no need for so much ceremony." [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, "Your and your wife's monthly wages will remain the same as before."

"Thank you, master." Gao Qing was relieved. He had been worried that the new masters would reduce their monthly wages.

"Your family has a heavy burden, and it is not easy. How about this, I will give your whole family half a shi of rice every month. This will save your family's food expenses."

"Master is benevolent!" Gao Qing was moved to tears and almost knelt down. Half a shi of rice was enough for the whole family to eat for a month. This master's one sentence was equivalent to raising his wages by five qian of silver.

"Here are twenty taels of silver. We travel on the waves of the sea, and our comings and goings are difficult. We will advance you one year's monthly wages first. The rest will be for the daily maintenance expenses of this place. As for the monthly rice, you can go and get it yourself." [Xiao Zishan][y001] paused for a moment. "Can you read?"

Gao Qing smiled awkwardly. His son, however, spoke up: "I can read."

"Oh?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] hadn't held out much hope.

"He hasn't had a job since he was little, and he always hangs around in the outer accounting office, so he knows a few characters," Gao Qing hurriedly explained, then glared at his son and muttered in a low voice, "What are you showing off for!"

The boy didn't know many characters and would only be considered semi-literate in modern times. But because he had learned from an accountant, he also knew some bookkeeping and how to use an abacus, which was quite valuable in ancient times.

He asked his name, which was Gao Di. [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought, the names of the working people in ancient times were really simple and clear.

"Since you can read and do bookkeeping, you will be in charge of the accounts here from now on. Every single transaction must be recorded clearly, understand? You will also get a monthly wage of one qian."

"I understand." Gao Qing was overjoyed and led his son to kowtow repeatedly.

Having him keep the accounts was not about the money, but to remind this family that every blade of grass and every piece of wood here belonged to them, to prevent them from getting the idea of the cuckoo occupying the magpie's nest over time—if such an idea arose, anything could happen. Although ordinary people seemed honest and dutiful, he had seen too many people whose temperament changed drastically in the face of profit.

After inspecting the terrain, the transmigrators decided to set up the crossing point in the study of the first courtyard. They then instructed Gao Qing that the first courtyard only needed to be cleaned every three days, and that he should not enter it at other times.

Although Gao Qing didn't understand why they had to do this, he understood the principle of asking fewer questions about his master's affairs. The only thing he found strange was that [Master Wen][y002] had explicitly specified the start date for this cleaning schedule.

After it was completely dark, the transmigrators opened the wormhole at the new location. Fortunately, the location on the other side had not changed. The hydraulic cart was brought over, and the several pallets piled high with goods were pulled over one by one.

The next day, when Gao Qing got up, the first courtyard was already empty. He hesitated for a moment, then went out and walked towards the back gate of the Gao residence.
