"May God protect you, mademoiselle," Mendoza whispered. "I will do everything in my power. Be assured of that. Keep your courage, and wait for good news. Farewell, mademoiselle."

The auction hall was stark in its simplicity. A raised platform, draped in woolen felt, jutted into the room, reminiscent of a fashion show runway from another time. Spotlights, specially requisitioned for the event, bathed the stage in a harsh glare, deepening the shadows that cloaked the rest of the cavernous space and shrouded it in mystery.

The patrons sat on chairs scattered around the periphery. Serving maids moved silently among them, their trays bearing cool drinks and distributing limited editions of South Sea cigars. The glowing tips of the cigars pulsed in the darkness, a constellation of tiny embers. The faint, crisp sound of ice clinking against glass punctuated the air, which hummed with the low murmur of whispers, like the suppressed thrum of a beehive.

Marina sat within an enclosure near the stage, where a few long benches were provided for the slaves. Their hair had been unbound, cascading down their backs, and they were all dressed in the same simple white frocks. The initial sting of humiliation had faded, replaced by a desperate urgency. Her eyes, now adjusted to the gloom, scanned the crowd, searching for any face that looked European.

In a shadowed corner, Fang Fei smoked a cigar. As a married man, he was barred from participating in the auction. Not that it mattered. His interest in beautiful women, foreign or otherwise, was a pale shadow of that held by his fellow Elders. Years of working in exhibition management had exposed him to a parade of showgirls from East and West. As he often said himself, "Forget eating my fill; I've grown weary from just looking."

This batch of S-grade maids—including those personally selected by Zhu Mingxia from the Shandong refugees currently in the purification camps—paled in comparison to any of the professional showgirls he had employed in the past. Basic nutrition was a foundation that was difficult to surpass.

But this was his job now. And a job, especially one of this magnitude, had to be executed to perfection. Anything touching upon the personal lives of the Elders was a matter of state. According to the directives from the Executive Committee and the General Office, all future S-grade maids would be sold via auction. To that end, the General Office was already planning a new service agency, a subordinate body dedicated to handling such affairs. He'd heard that Old Hong was intensely interested in the project. Though stationed in Hong Kong, his letters arrived daily on the ferry from Hong Kong to Bo Pu. The man was clearly planning something big.

His staff—he instinctively called them his "assistants"—stood behind him, awaiting his commands. Though the auction was about to begin, Fang Fei was a man obsessed with details, forever issuing new directives. He snapped his fingers, and an assistant immediately stepped forward.

"Have they been given water?"

"They all had a cup before we set out."

"Give each of them a glass of iced coffee now." Fang Fei sniffed the air. "And tell the General Office staff to bring more blocks of ice. Place them around the stage; the temperature here is getting too high. Oh, and send me the assistant in charge of the slave enclosure!"

The iced coffee and the blocks of ice were calculated measures to minimize sweating. Caucasians had a stronger body odor, and under the intense, hot lights of the stage, excessive perspiration could release an unpleasant aroma. The coffee itself would act as a mild stimulant, ensuring the women appeared alert and in peak condition.

"Yes, Director," the assistant replied, hurrying off. A moment later, the assistant responsible for the slaves came rushing over.

"Why is their hair down?" Fang Fei demanded. "All that thick hair... it's like they're wearing shawls!"

The assistant stammered out a defense. "Director, I thought... I thought the Chiefs would want to see their beautiful hair. You once said the Chiefs prefer maids with long hair..."

"They prefer maids with delicate necks, rounded shoulders, and smooth, beautiful backs," Fang Fei countered coldly. "By letting their hair down, you've essentially made them wear an extra coat. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Director. I'll have it changed immediately!" the assistant said, trembling. Chief Fang might look refined and scholarly, but he showed no mercy when reprimanding his female staff—a stark contrast to other Chiefs who typically softened their tone when addressing female subordinates.

"You certainly have a professional mindset..." a voice drifted from the darkness.

"Training showgirls was my job, after all," Fang Fei said, unconcerned. He rose to greet the newcomer, the head of the Ministry of Health, Shi Niaoren, a cigar glowing in his mouth.

Shi Niaoren hadn't entered the lottery and had no intention of bidding. He was here purely as an observer, to study the slaves' racial and physiological characteristics, gathering more data for the Ministry's eugenics research.

"You know, showgirls and slaves... their status may be different, but they are both products of the objectification of women," the Minister mused, a touch of melancholy in his voice.

"What's this? Minister Shi, are you planning to buy one?"

"Me?" Shi Niaoren shook his head. "Not at the moment. Back in my graduate school days in America, I was full of vigor. I can't deny I was tempted by those well-endowed foreign women. Even paid for the experience once in Las Vegas, to see what all the fuss was about. But now... the interest has faded." He touched his forehead, where his hairline was beginning to retreat. "I'm getting old, old..."

"You're middle-aged at most. What's this talk of being old? You should get a few maids and have a few children!" Fang Fei joked. "Or we could have Liu San check your pulse and prescribe some restorative herbs."

Shi Niaoren shook his head. "Let's not involve that charlatan witch doctor, Liu San. Since D-Day, I've become a true living Lei Feng... I wake up and my mind is filled with the affairs of the Elders. I've lost interest in my own. My worry is that with all this fanfare over women, the Ministry of Health's maternal and child care services won't be able to keep up."

The first baby boom had already arrived. The first wave of distributed maids, however much the Elders complained about their quality, had been fruitful. Starting with Tang Menglong's son, more than fifty "Second Generation" children had been born, with dozens more maids currently pregnant. Ai Beibei was so busy she was run off her feet.

"Speaking of which, why wasn't their hair shaved this time?" Shi Niaoren asked. "Many parasites can't be completely eliminated without shaving all body hair!"

"We had complaints from the Elders last time," Fang Fei explained. "They said it was difficult to judge beauty without hair. So this time we're planning a two-stage purification. The second round will happen after they've been assigned."

"The depraved tastes of these nerds," the Minister muttered under his breath.

Meanwhile, the assistant returned to the enclosure. She summoned several maids and instructed them on how to braid the slaves' hair, securing it with pins and silk ribbons.

Marina submitted numbly to being handled, her eyes continuing their desperate search of the shadowed audience. The priest had promised her he would persuade an Italian painter to bid on her behalf, to buy her no matter the cost. But as far as she could see, there wasn't a single European face besides Mendoza's.

Had the priest failed to convince him? Or had the Italian lost his nerve at the last moment? The thoughts tormented her.

"What are you looking for?" a voice beside her asked suddenly. "Do you know someone here?"

"You speak Spanish?" Marina asked, startled. Realizing her voice was too loud, she repeated the question in a hushed tone.

The speaker was a petite, blonde girl with blue eyes, her expression serene and calm. "A little," she replied. "Do you speak Portuguese?"

"Yes, I do," Marina switched to Portuguese. "Who are you? How did you fall into the hands of the Australians?"

"What are Australians?" the girl asked.

"This is the Australians' territory."

"I don't know... I was captured by Barbary pirates." She sighed. "My ship was attacked while surveying the Cape Verde islands. They sent me to Basra, and from there, I came here." She looked around with open curiosity. "I've never heard of any Australians. Judging by their appearance, aren't they just a type of East Asian? They look almost like Tartars. Is this Asia?"

Marina was glad to have a fellow captive to talk to, but she was also annoyed by the girl's casual demeanor. "You don't seem very concerned about being a slave. Haven't you thought of escaping?"

"Escape?" The girl gave a helpless shrug. "I was captured over a year ago. I don't even know what corner of the Earth I'm in."

Just then, maids brought the iced coffee. Everyone accepted a cup, except for Marina. She suspected it was drugged and feigned a stomachache.

"Aha! It's coffee!" the blonde girl exclaimed, seemingly delighted. "But it's not quite like Arabian coffee." She savored it carefully.

"What? You know of this drink?"

"It's a favorite of the Turks," the girl said, proud of her knowledge. "The Arabs and the Turks both drink it. It lifts the spirits." She glanced at the buyers in the audience. "I'm surprised to find it here!"

Marina stared at the girl, dumbfounded. It was as if she was completely oblivious to the horror of her situation.

The auction began. The hall fell into an orderly silence, all eyes fixed on the T-stage. As the attention of the crowd was captured, Mendoza reappeared, slipping quietly to the enclosure. After a few words with the guards, she led Marina aside.

"Look, that is Signor Trini," she said, indicating a direction with her eyes. "I have already spoken with him. He will do his utmost."

"Thank you so much for your help," Marina whispered. She looked and, sure enough, sitting far from the stage, she saw a man who looked Latin, a European. He was neatly dressed and was looking their way.
