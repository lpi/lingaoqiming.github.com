"Ah De, isn't this a bit too much?"

"You people, you talk tougher than anyone else, always wanting to slaughter Japan and destroy the US, but you can't stand it when you see someone cry a few times?" Wu De said with a cold face to Yuan Qiushi, "Whoever cries, beat them hard until they stop crying."

Little Yuan was indeed young and ruthless. The stick came down with a crackle. Xiong Buyou roared, "No crying, all of you stand up straight!"

Wu De knew that these five people couldn't even be considered tenant farmers or long-term laborers. They belonged to the lowest level of short-term laborers in old China's rural areas. A tenant farmer still had a house and a piece of land that, although not his own, could still yield some harvest. A long-term laborer at least had a shed to live in and was provided with coarse grains. These people were truly the poor who had nothing to their names and didn't know where their next meal would come from. A trace of sympathy rose in his heart, but he quickly erased it. Sympathy was a luxury for the transmigrators. They had come to a time and space that did not belong to them, and everything had to be paved with the flesh and blood of others. What was enslaving a few people? Moreover, if these people could survive to see the success of the great cause of transmigration, they would probably boast about being the earliest followers of the dragon. Their descendants would be proud of their ancestors' days as slaves, and might even write books, appear on TV, and sign autographs, praising the transmigrators as the inevitable trend of historical development. As for whether they would be slapped in the face, it was hard to say.

After the beating, the captives were submissive, with their heads bowed and their eyes downcast, not daring to look up. Everyone knew that this was the leader in charge of them. It seemed that he would not take their lives for the time being, so their future days would depend on this leader's personal likes and dislikes. These sea pirates were not even afraid of the government's laws, let alone a few commoners. Killing a person was no different from crushing a fly.

"This is our first meeting. From now on, you are my transmigrators' people." Wu De raised his voice, "You must do whatever I say! Work hard, and you will not lack for two meals and one set of clothes. Otherwise..." He snorted coldly, "From tomorrow on, this Leader Xiong will no longer be here to translate for you. When I speak, if you don't understand once, or twice, I can forgive you. If you still don't understand the third time, you will be immediately taken out and beheaded! What's the use of keeping such useless people?!" He spoke with a stern voice and a fierce expression. Xiong Buyou also roared at the top of his lungs, probably trying to accurately convey his spirit.

Language communication was the biggest obstacle between the transmigrators and the local laborers. Of course, Wu De could not always have the only translator in the team with him. In terms of the effect of rapid learning, severity and brutality were more effective than patient guidance.

The captives' faces all showed unease, but when his eyes swept over them, they all lowered their heads.

He Ma whispered from the side, "Isn't it bad to always threaten to kill people like this? What if they can't learn? Will you really kill them?"

Wu De gave him a dissatisfied look and sneered, "Then we'll kill them."

He Ma's neck suddenly felt a little cold. He knew very well to what extent human brutality could be amplified in an environment without constraints.

"Now, roll call. When your name is called, you must answer 'Here!' This is the first rule you must remember. If you are not here at the first call, you will receive forty lashes with a rattan cane. If you are not here at the second call, you will receive eighty lashes. If you are not here at the third call, you will receive two hundred lashes."

"Wang Tian!" Wu De called the first name from the list.

"Huh?" The one who responded was a short man, probably only about 1.5 meters tall, and in his early twenties.

"Say 'Here'!" Little Yuan cooperated tacitly, and the whip had already come down.

Wang Tian, who had been corrected by the stick, quickly corrected his mistake.

"Lin Xing!"

The person who answered had a loud voice, but his pronunciation was still incomprehensible. This person looked taller and more robust. Although his head was bowed, Wu De could still see a trace of rebelliousness in him.

"I don't understand." Wu De was determined to beat the last bit of rebelliousness out of him. With a wave of his hand, another round of beatings followed until he could shout "Here" more correctly.

The power of example is infinite—the next three people could all shout the word "Here" more accurately. After they basically got the hang of it, Wu De led the team to work. He acted as both a guard and a supervisor, without neglecting either. There were actually quite a few people working on the construction site.

He deliberately arranged these people to be a little closer to the machinery. Even for modern people, watching construction machinery at work at such a close distance would be very shocking, let alone a few natives who had never been out of the county. When they discovered that the transmigrators possessed not only them, the common people, but also a huge power that no one could resist, they would become loyal, and sooner or later they would be proud of the strength of the organization that enslaved them.

When they saw the excavator let out a huge roar and turn its digging arm towards them, the few of them were so scared that they turned and ran, until they were stopped by Wu De.

"What are you running for? Get to work!"

The captives knelt on the ground and begged bitterly. Although he couldn't understand their gibberish, Wu De still understood that they were afraid of the huge machine—they thought it was some kind of monster. It wasn't until Wu De pointed out to them that there was also a pirate sitting in the transparent box that they knew it was operated by a person.

The excavators, bulldozers, and small dump trucks running back and forth on the construction site—the shock brought by mechanized construction was unparalleled. In comparison, digging with a shovel and carrying with a basket was no different from an ant.

With a devil like Wu De and a ruthless little thug like Yuan Qiushi by their side, no one dared to slack off. The captives worked very hard. After half a day of getting along, they found that although this Leader Wu had a fierce look on his face, he was much better than the teenager who took pleasure in beating them.

When they finished work in the evening, Wu De took them all to a separate shed. This place was within the surveillance range of the watchtower, and the camp was surrounded by barbed wire, so there was no need to worry about them escaping. He Ma was waiting there with a medicine box. According to the examination at noon, he was going to give these laborers the necessary treatment. After forcing them to take another bath and boil their clothes, the few of them were brought naked before He Ma. He Ma took a ladle and poured slightly hot water on them, and then scrubbed them hard with a grass brush from who knows where. The few of them didn't even dare to make a sound, let alone scream.

"What are you doing?"

"Treating scabies infection. This is to brush open the infected parts so that the medicine can be applied." He Ma explained, rubbing a kind of ointment on their skin with gauze.

"Sulfur ointment. I would have forgotten about this if [Wen Zong][y002] hadn't reminded me," He Ma said while rubbing hard. "Few people in the 21st century are infected with scabies."

"Also," He Ma began to apply other ointments to them, "don't let them take a bath for the next few days. Wait until this course of treatment is over."

"Is it difficult to treat?"

"It's very easy, but this thing is contagious through skin contact, which is very annoying." He Ma was fully equipped with protective gear himself.

"Should I apply some too?" Wu De was a little worried. This thing seemed to be very itchy when it flared up. He had seen these people scratching desperately more than once today.

"It's okay, just take a bath and change your clothes. Try not to have skin contact with them. By the way, the straw they sleep on must be taken out and burned every day."

After all this was done, He Ma took out a pile of small pills and told them to eat them. Although they were suspicious of these small white round pills, they still swallowed them under Wu De's high pressure.

"It's a pity I don't know traditional Chinese medicine, nor do I recognize Chinese herbal medicine." He Ma shook his head. "I remember that deworming is also a prescription."

"Fu Youdi."

"Here!" After an afternoon of breaking in, everyone could quickly respond to the roll call, and they also understood a little of what the pirate leader was saying—the price was a bruised and battered butt.

"You are the team leader." The reason Wu De appointed him as the leader was very simple—he was not worthy. This local-born farmer was not strong, not smart enough, and could not speak fluently. He would definitely not be able to command the respect of the others as a team leader. What he wanted was the effect of not being able to command respect.

"Me?" Fu Youdi was still a little confused.

"Yes, from now on, you will be in charge of getting your meals and leading the work. If anything goes wrong, you will be the only one to be held responsible!"

[Wu Nanhai][y009] had originally given them rice according to the share of the transmigrators, with four liang of rice per person for a regular meal, which was about right for people engaged in heavy physical labor. But Wu De did not intend to let them eat their fill. In his opinion, eating one's fill should be a reward and should not be given easily. So he asked [Wu Nanhai][y009] to cut it by half.

"Is that enough to eat..." [Wu Nanhai][y009] said doubtfully.

"It's better if it's not enough. People tend to think too much when they are full."

"I don't think so. I just want to take a nap when I'm full..."

"That's you. Add water for me, yes, add more, make it into seafood congee for me."

When Yuan Qiushi brought the congee in a wooden bucket, the rice had become a full bucket of thin congee. But even so, when the lid of the bucket was opened, the few captives were still dumbfounded: snow-white rice congee, with a lot of fish meat and shellfish meat floating in it, and the aroma was overwhelming—although Lingao was coastal, ordinary people rarely had the opportunity to eat fresh fish. At most, they would be given a piece of smelly salted fish by their masters during the busy farming season. If they hadn't been scared by Wu De, they would have rushed up long ago.

The captives were given wooden bowls and chopsticks made by who knows who, and the task of distributing the food was left to the newly appointed team leader.

"Whoever dares to make trouble during meals will not only have nothing to eat for this meal, but will also not be given any food for the whole of tomorrow!" Wu De said fiercely and walked away. He knew that even the most timid person, once they had the support of the leader, would become wanton and reckless, not to mention matters of personal interest such as eating.
