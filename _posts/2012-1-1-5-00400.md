The lights were blazing in the "Farm," the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's Section B training center—formerly Gou Er's residence—in Lin'gao County. In several of the side rooms, now converted into classrooms, sat a few individuals from the Ming dynasty, all with solemn expressions. The doors and windows were shut, and apart from the numerical code plaques hanging by the doors, there were no other markings.

Li Yan entered each room to talk with them. The Ming individuals in the side rooms were all Senators who had undergone long-term training by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, preparing to be dispatched to the mainland. They would be sent to various locations to carry out intelligence gathering, network building, and trade operations, laying the groundwork for the next phase of the mainland strategy.

Neither Guo Yi's Guangzhou team nor Chang Shide's Leizhou team was present—both groups were currently operating in a semi-public capacity. Guangzhou and Leizhou were now considered "Yellow Zones." The personnel gathered here were all heading to "Orange" and "Red" zones. They were taking on immense risks. As Minister Shi had said during their hygiene lecture, the greatest danger was not the incompetent Ming secret service—who couldn't even disrupt a primitive intelligence system—but the overall sanitary conditions of the ancient world.

Every dispatched member had signed a volunteer form and, as required, written a will. Some had been reluctant. "I have no children or family in this world. What's the point of writing this?"

Tong Guan was one of them. As the head of the installation company, he had been handling equipment installation for the General Construction Corporation since D-Day. The moment the Foreign Intelligence Bureau was established, he immediately signed up for fieldwork. Now, his wish was granted, and he had become the leader of the "Yangtze River Task Force."

The "Yangtze River Task Force" was a long-term intelligence-gathering project initiated by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Its primary mission was to conduct geographical surveys of military strongpoints and transportation hubs along the Yangtze River basin. They were to perform necessary geographical mapping of important ferries and customs posts, while also collecting intelligence on the economic, social, and political groups along the river. This would serve as the decision-making basis for the "Yangtze Strategy," one of the transmigrators' alternate plans. The operation's codename, nominated by Tong Guan himself, was "Mandarin Duck Tea."

In addition to this task force, the Bureau would also dispatch intelligence and trade teams to Hangzhou and Beijing, using the networks of both the Shanxi and maritime merchants to establish their presence. Furthermore, members of the Liaodong team would travel with the Guangzhou team first, preparing to enter Liaodong with arrangements made by Li Luoyou.

Deploying four teams simultaneously in Yellow and Red zones was a first in the history of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. A dozen Senators would be sent on external assignments at the same time, a move so bold it caused some concern in the Senate. However, under the premise of advancing the mainland strategy as quickly as possible to secure more resources, population, and financial channels, the risk was deemed necessary.

The members of each team had already memorized their mission briefs—which were collected immediately after reading. Not a single slip of paper was allowed to be taken out. Li Yan was now giving them their final mission briefing, covering travel arrangements for entering the operational area and contingency plans for unexpected situations.

The route and mode of transport for each team were confidential; each team only knew its own travel plan. Only Li Yan knew all the details.

In one of the largest rooms sat the biggest clandestine group of this operation: the "Yangtze River Task Force." The four members of this team were currently in the room, drinking tea and shooting the breeze. Although most had undergone more than six months of training and scoffed at the Ming's counter-espionage capabilities, on the eve of infiltrating deep into enemy territory, each felt a sense of tension and pressure.

They drank strong tea and chatted about everything under the sun to ease their nerves. A few felt the urge to smoke again, but they had already quit. In the places they were going, cigarettes were a rare overseas commodity, and even smoking a pipe or a water pipe would likely be impossible. The Chongzhen Emperor, during his reign, frequently launched intermittent anti-smoking campaigns. At their most severe, smoking could even be a capital offense. To avoid unnecessary trouble, quitting was the best solution.

"Once we leave, who knows when we'll be back," Tong Guan said, sipping his tea.

"I'd say three or four years," Zhang Biao said. "With the transportation conditions of this era, just visiting all the counties along the Yangtze would take a long time, even in our time with cars and trains." As he spoke, he fiddled with a Yongle-era coin. It flickered between his fingers, one coin becoming three, then four, then five, before vanishing completely.

Zhang Biao was a master's student in history and a magic enthusiast, specializing in coin tricks. In preparation for his intelligence work, he had diligently practiced various "sleight of hand" techniques, planning to use the guise of a street performer as cover for his reconnaissance. He was to be one of Tong Guan's key team members.

"It would be fine in times of peace, but these next three or four years are the twilight of the Ming Dynasty," said Ji Jianzhang, looking a bit uneasy. He was dressed as a private secretary or an accountant. Ji Jianzhang had excellent calligraphy skills, which had been specially honed at the intelligence bureau.

Tong Guan, however, was unconcerned. "The real chaos hasn't arrived yet. The counties along the Yangtze we're going to still have law and order. Besides, we'll have a martial arts expert protecting us."

Xu Tianqi said, "I don't have much faith in martial arts experts. I'd rather carry more bullets; that's more reliable." He originally worked in the foreign affairs department, but since there wasn't much for that department to do and the work was dull, he had decided to throw himself into intelligence work on a temporary basis. He had received less training. Tong Guan planned to station him at an intelligence post as a resident member. Xu Tianqi's specialty was English—which was useless, of course—but he had a good grasp of the Jianghuai dialects, which was a valuable skill.

"Whether it's a martial arts expert or a pistol, neither is the key issue. The key is money," Tong Guan said leisurely. "With money, you can go anywhere in the world. Without it, you can't take a single step."

The Yangtze River Task Force's operation was long-term. The Executive Committee and the Intelligence Bureau placed no specific restrictions on their work content, only providing a general direction. Their operational area stretched from Nanjing down to Chongqing and Chengdu upriver. Once the intelligence team set out, they would have to rely entirely on themselves, including raising a portion of their subsequent operational funds.

"How much money will the Foreign Intelligence Bureau give us?" Xu Tianqi was very interested in this.

Tong Guan said, "Li Yan discussed it with me last time. About five hundred taels of silver. That should be enough to get started. We're traveling far, so we can't carry too much money. Flashing wealth can easily lead to trouble."

Just as they were talking, Li Yan came in, carrying a canvas bag with a smile.

"Director Li, you're finally here!" Tong Guan said with an effusive expression, standing up to shake his hand.

"Hehe, sorry to keep you waiting," Li Yan said, placing the canvas bag on the table. "This is your equipment."

"When do we leave?"

"Within the next three days," Li Yan said. "We've already arranged your transportation." He sat down, opened the bag, and began distributing the contents to the people present.

"You'll first take a boat to Guangzhou. At the Qiwei Escort Agency in Guangzhou, you'll meet up with your native bodyguard—this man." Li Yan handed Tong Guan a paper folder. "Here's his file. Take a look, but you have to give it back to me when you're done."

Tong Guan opened it and let out a chuckle.

"Li Xiaogang? Is his father's name Li Dagang?"

"Correct. That's the name," Li Yan said. "Li Dagang is one of the older generation from the Qiwei Escort Agency. His martial arts skills are formidable. It's only in recent years, as he's gotten older and weaker, that he's stopped going on escort missions. His son is very skilled with both his fists and weapons; he's a rising star in Qiwei's new generation."

"Is he reliable?"

"Very reliable," Li Yan said. "Lin'gao saved Li Dagang's life, and Li Xiaogang has attended a special training course in Lin'gao. The Political Security Bureau gives their whole family a very high rating. Plus, Li Xiaogang's son has already been sent to study at Fangcao Di."

This time, besides Li Xiaogang acting as the traveling bodyguard for the Yangtze team, Li Dagang and Li Xiaogang's wife, Xiang Chunhua, would also accompany them.

"Xiang Chunhua also comes from a family of escort bodyguards. She'll be very useful to your team."

"The whole family is pitching in? That's true loyalty."

"There's no harm in having more hands." Another thing Li Yan didn't mention was that this was a tactic by the Colonial and Trade Department to break up the factions within the Qiwei Escort Agency. Li Dagang was from Jiangxi and was one of Sun Kecheng's most loyal "hometown brothers," the core of the Jiangxi clique. This was a perfect opportunity to split them up.

Li Yan then took out a cloth pouch from the bag and opened a corner, revealing glittering gold leaves.

"Fifty taels of gold," Li Yan said. "According to the Ming exchange rate, that's roughly six hundred taels of silver." Gold was easier to carry than silver, and merchants on long journeys with large sums of money often converted it to gold beforehand.

Finally, there were four Glock pistols, each with two magazines, the standard personal sidearm for Senators. These were their own service pistols, which had been sent for inspection and maintenance a few days prior. There were also 200 rounds of 9mm ammunition, packed in a small metal box.

Some intelligence officers believed that pistols were unnecessary for trade and intelligence work. However, the state of public security in this era was poor, and they wouldn't feel safe without a powerful weapon for self-defense. After much discussion, it was decided to issue pistols to the trade and intelligence personnel. Of course, they could also choose not to carry them.

The Yangtze River Task Force would not be equipped with a radio because Tong Guan had not yet decided where to establish the task force's base. The Intelligence Bureau suggested Nanjing, but Tong Guan felt that the Hangzhou intelligence team would be operating in the Jiangnan region in the future, and setting up another base in Nanjing would be redundant. He personally advocated for establishing it in Wuchang.

In the late Ming Dynasty, Wuchang was a strategic battleground. The Intelligence Bureau was not very supportive of his proposal—after all, ensuring the safety of the Senators was the top priority.

"Wuchang's geographical location is crucial," Tong Guan argued. "It's not only a major city in the middle reaches of the Yangtze but also connects to Shaanxi, Hanzhong, and other areas. It's a key point for both north and south. We can gather a lot of useful information in Wuchang." He was very interested in this location.
