Despite the neglect, a deal could be made. The other party was very interested in the thousand dan of sugar he had brought. Although they couldn't produce that much ready cash, the terms of exchanging it for rice were agreed upon instantly.

"Eight Spanish silver dollars per dan of sugar," the steward offered.

Chang Shide was furious. *Do they take us for fools?* The lowest market price was clearly seven taels of silver per dan. Eight Spanish silver dollars per dan was equivalent to only... only... he quickly calculated, "only five taels!"

He quickly shook his head, saying it was too low, much lower than the market price. Zhang Dabala whispered with the steward for a while, and the steward smiled slightly and began to speak. Zhang Dabala translated:

"Only our master here can provide you with the sufficient quantity of rice and silver you need to buy your sugar in cash. Otherwise, you can sell it to the Ming merchants at the pier and come back for your money this time next year. Perhaps—" Zhang Dabala hesitated for a moment before translating, "you can wait at the pier for other more generous customers, but the weather here is very hot..."

Chang Shide's blood boiled. He wanted to shoot this treacherous merchant on the spot, but seeing his fearless demeanor, he had to suppress his anger. He suddenly had a personal understanding of the textbook story "Harvesting Three or Five Dou More." He said to Zhang Dabala, "Can you negotiate with him to add one or two more dollars?" If they could raise it to 10 silver dollars, that would be seven taels. Although not the best price, it would be acceptable.

The treacherous merchant shook his head repeatedly. "Not even one more dollar. However, the cost of transporting the rice to the pier will be borne by our estate."

Chang Shide began to persuade him, saying that doing business with him would definitely be profitable because he had all sorts of novel goods that could make a huge profit. He wished he could find a mirror to show him, hoping that he would adhere to the principle of long-term cooperation and raise the price appropriately. In short, he was peddling the "win-win" theory. Unexpectedly, the treacherous steward showed an impatient expression, shouted a few words at Zhang Dabala, which made Zhang Dabala look unhappy as well. He had to tell him:

"He said either we close the deal at this price, or he won't entertain us any longer."

In the end, Chang Shide finally gave in. A thousand dan of sugar was sold at eight silver dollars per dan. Of the 8,000 dollars in payment, Vu Ngoc Giap's side paid him 1,200 Spanish silver dollars, and the rest was converted into coarse rice at a price of five qian per dan. Chang Shide did a quick calculation. He could get about nine thousand seven hundred dan of rice! That was over nine hundred tons—in comparison, the official tax of a single Lingao county was less than eight thousand dan. The difference in agricultural productivity was too great!

Although he had suffered a small loss, thinking that if he had transported it to Guangzhou to sell, the British purchase price was only three taels and eight qian, he had still made a lot of money. This was a small consolation. Besides, if this batch of rice was transported to Leizhou, it would be worth twenty thousand taels of silver according to the market price. The profit from this transaction was still considerable. It reminded him of the days when he played *Uncharted Waters*, trading art and carpets between Athens and Istanbul.

Although the Great Whale had a superior cargo capacity, it could only carry three hundred tons at full load, and Bei Kai still had to find the Hon Gai coal mine. So, all the grain was temporarily stored in the local granary, to be loaded on the next ship.

Bei Kai knew that this place was not far from Hon Gai. Perhaps this big landlord knew where the open-pit coal mines were. He had Zhang Dabala ask if there was any coal exposed on the ground locally.

The steward listened, slowly nodded, and said, "I've heard of it, over in Cam Pha, but it's all mountains."

Bei Kai's interest was piqued. He quickly asked, "Where is Cam Pha?"

The steward rolled his eyes. He probably thought this dark, thin, and unimpressive little man was not a Ming merchant, but a "Vietnamese traitor." With a look of disdain, he said a few words to Zhang Dabala. Zhang Dabala had a wry smile and looked at Bei Kai with sympathy—it probably wasn't anything good.

In the end, it was Chang Shide who asked again, and the steward finally answered:

"It's not far from here. If you go south along the coastline by boat, you can get there in a day." A strange expression appeared on the steward's face. "What's so special about this black stone? If you want to burn fire, you can use firewood or charcoal. The estate has plenty. I can't say much, but if you want one or two hundred dan, you can have it right away."

Chang Shide wanted to ask for more details, or at least get a guide, but the steward, seeing that they didn't want to buy firewood or charcoal, stood up and left. The servants then came to "see the guests out." The group was thus driven out.

The business was done, and the profit was not bad, but the whole thing felt awkward. Whether it was Chang Shide, Bei Kai, or even Zhang Dabala, they all felt very unhappy.

"In the future, I will be the tyrannical governor of Tonkin, oppressing men and women!" Bei Kai said through gritted teeth.

"When the time comes, we'll wipe out this traitor's family first!" Chang Shide usually hated it when people were casually called traitors, but at this moment, his nationalist sentiments erupted. "Those who are not of my race must have a different heart! Traitor!"

Zhang Dabala also cursed, "This fellow Vu Ngoc Thanh has such a big ego now! A slave under him is so rude! When our big gang came here back then, this old boy came to the pier to greet us, bowing and scraping. There was no shortage of wine, meat, and women. He even gave me a woman!" His words carried a sense of a fallen phoenix being inferior to a chicken.

Chang Shide asked, "Your big gang has been to Vietnam before?"

"Yes, we helped them fight a war. It was said to be against some King of Quang Nam named Nguyen Hoang. But the women they sent were really not bad—" In Zhang Dabala's mind, these matters were obviously less memorable than the women.

Back on the ship, everyone rested for a day. After the people from the Vu family estate had unloaded the cargo, the ship continued to sail south.

Zhang Dabala was familiar with the sea routes. Although he didn't know where Cam Pha was, he had been to the coast of Vietnam many times over the years. There were indeed many places along Ha Long Bay where coal could be dug out in the open, but no one had ever mined or sold it here. Since the Australian merchants liked this black stone so much, he would lead them to find it. After the job was done, there would surely be a reward.

The night passed without incident. The next morning, when Chang Shide woke up, he felt that the ship had already stopped. Looking out of the sterncastle window, Chang Shide found himself in a dreamlike scene. Hundreds of strangely shaped, verdant small mountains dotted the sea, and mist drifted between the flying birds and the islands.

"Damn, it's so beautiful!" Chang Shide knew that this must be Ha Long Bay. He was about to go up on deck to have a look when A'Xiu came in, carrying a washbasin, a cup, and a spittoon.

"Master, please wash up."

"When did the ship stop?" Chang Shide asked.

"Master, the ship stopped a while ago." A'Xiu handed him the toothbrush with toothpaste already squeezed on it, giving him a charming smile at the same time. These days, the master had been favoring her much more than A'Zi and A'Bi, which made her feel that her stock was rising in his eyes. The other two female slaves had also become more respectful towards her. This time, he had specifically brought her along, and she felt that her chances of advancing further were even greater. Of course, A'Xiu knew that she could not be the mistress, but it was very possible to become a concubine. So she served Chang Shide with even more meticulous care.

After washing up, Chang Shide went up on deck. The sun had not yet risen. He looked at his watch; it was not yet 6 a.m. The air was slightly salty and refreshingly intoxicating.

On the sea, near and far, were small limestone mountains of strange shapes, like the stone mountains in Guilin and Yangshuo in Guangxi. These peaks, jutting out from the turquoise sea, had various shapes and were covered with lush vegetation, with flocks of birds landing and taking off from time to time. The mountains were on the sea, and the reflection of the mountains was on the sea. The spring morning's almost transparent blue sky was reflected on the sea. Each mountain seemed to be floating in a blue, transparent, and infinite illusion. The sunlight, projected on the rippling sea surface, was ever-changing and colorful. In the distance, there were some fishing boats with ocher-colored double sails, sailing out from between the mountain gorges, drifting in the green mountains and blue sea. In a blink of an eye, they disappeared into the shadows of the mountains. It was confusing and dreamlike.

"This is a good place," Chang Shide became more certain, because the scene before him was very similar to the tourist videos of Ha Long Bay he had seen. He had had many thoughts about Vietnamese girls in the past, and now, seeing this beautiful scenery, his thoughts about girls came back. "If I build a seaside villa here and have a few hundred, no, a few dozen Vietnamese girls lie naked on the beach..."

As his thoughts ran wild, he suddenly saw Bei Kai also on the deck. Bei Kai had been learning Vietnamese from Zhang Dabala since he boarded the ship. Was he preparing to be a Vietnamese landlord here? Chang Shide was puzzled by his enthusiasm for learning.

Zhang Dabala was sitting by the helm, thickly dressed and looking bloated, not at all like a heroic pirate, but more like a poor old peasant reminiscing about past bitterness and thinking of present sweetness.

Seeing Chang Shide come up, Zhang Dabala introduced that the place where the coal was was not far ahead. Once they landed, they could buy coal from the local villagers.

"Buy coal? No one goes up to mine?"

"Manager Chang, this black coal is not a rare thing. You can also buy it in Guangdong. Who would be so bored as to come here to buy coal? Besides, except for blacksmiths, ordinary people have more than enough firewood to burn. Why use this black and dirty thing?"

So that's how it was. Chang Shide thought that without demand, there would naturally be no development. What a pity for the 20 billion tons of high-quality anthracite here.

Under the guidance of Zhang Dabala, the ship moored in a desolate harbor. The advantage of a shallow-draft ship was evident here. There was no need to lower a small boat; a single gangplank was enough to land.

Chang Shide and the others changed into Ming Dynasty clothes and went ashore under the guidance of Zhang Dabala. This was a hilly area with uneven ground and not very dense vegetation. According to Zhang Dabala, because the soil layer here was very thin, the harvest from farming on the coalfields was not good. Except for fishermen, few people settled here.

President Wen's instruction to Chang Shide was to "engage in trade first, and then try to get the coal mine after the channel is opened." But this place was unfamiliar, and they couldn't even find a living soul. There was no one to do business with.

They led their men a few kilometers inland but saw few people. Sometimes, as soon as they saw a figure, it would run away at a speed faster than a monkey.

Bei Kai, holding a map and a compass, constantly interpreted the surrounding scenery and terrain, pointing the way forward.

Bei Kai was looking for a stone mountain called "Poem Mountain." It was located on a peninsula jutting out into the sea, shaped like a cat's ear. It was said that the so-called "True Ancestor Emperor" of Vietnam had once composed a poem on this mountain. Later, many Vietnamese "famous scholars" and "heroes" also followed suit and composed poems on this mountain, hence the name.

"What Poem Mountain? Just call it Cat Ear Mountain. It's so descriptive!" Chang Shide said dismissively after hearing his explanation.

Cat Ear Mountain was quickly found with the help of the compass and the map. It was over 400 meters high and was very conspicuous among a pile of small hills. The headquarters of the Hon Gai Coal Company in another time and space was built around the foot of this mountain by the sea. The entire city of Hon Gai, when the French had just withdrawn, was two kilometers long from east to west and had a population of thirty thousand. It was a mining city of considerable scale.

At this time, there was nothing here. Only the grass and trees danced in the sea breeze. Hon Gai had a natural harbor, which was why it could become the location of the coal company's headquarters.

"It's too desolate," Chang Shide muttered. It would be convenient to dig coal here, but it was so poor and barren. Who would be the miners?

"Can we dig coal here?" Chang Shide said.

"Not yet," Bei Kai said. "There are three or four large open-pit mining areas. I don't know if this is the Cam Pha mining area. This is the only open-pit mine by the sea."

"There should be small open-pit mines, right?"

"There should be," Bei Kai was not very confident. He was a self-taught exploration team member. "It's a pity that Captain Cui went to Tian Du for inspection, otherwise he would definitely be accurate if he came."

Bei Kai naturally used the old method—digging test pits. The soldiers began to draw lines and work in this hilly area. It was unknown whether it was because of the constant sea breeze or the barren soil here, but there were no large trees, only some low shrubs. It was completely different from the vibrant and spring-like inland of Hai Duong they had visited yesterday. This provided great convenience for their prospecting work.

According to the data, there were no mine shafts at the headquarters of the Hon Gai Coal Company, so Bei Kai chose a test digging site about 2 kilometers inland, already on the slope of the hills.

Bei Kai chose a small hill as a standard point. According to a 15-meter grid, he divided the hilly area within a 1500-meter radius around the small hill. Then, in groups of three, the eight groups began to work on the 100 grid points. The main content of the work was to dig test pits.

The requirement for the test pits was to be 3 meters deep. Hon Gai was known for its large open-pit mines, and the coal mines were large and concentrated, but there were only three or four open-pit mining areas exposed on the surface. Cat Ear Mountain was not an open-pit zone. Whether they could find a small open-pit mine was a matter of luck.
