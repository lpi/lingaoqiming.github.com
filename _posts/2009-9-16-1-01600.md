The agenda moved on to the machinery manufacturing industry, which was [Chief Wen][y002]'s own field. The discussion mainly revolved around what equipment to bring. [Zhan Wuya][y004] had already contributed a small machinery factory, and he reported on the types of equipment it had.

"Can this equipment produce the various specialized machinery we need? Um, for example, boilers?"

"Theoretically, it's entirely possible. Take my small factory, for example. It doesn't have much equipment, but as long as we have the right materials, we can put together general mechanical equipment for you. Of course, my factory mainly processes various parts for others and hasn't made complex complete sets of machinery. There are also some small parts that we generally don't make," [Zhan Wuya][y004] scratched his head. He was not used to standing on a stage like this and being consulted. "For example, various standard parts, oh—" he realized that many people didn't know what standard parts were, so he explained, "they are mechanical parts used for fastening connections, such as screws, bolts, washers, and so on. It's best to use specialized equipment to manufacture them."

"Of course, we can also manufacture these, it's just a bit more troublesome. We can make some specialized machines to manufacture these standard parts.

"There are also things like various castings, gears, bearings, and so on. These are not things that a small machinery factory like ours can manufacture. It involves specialized equipment, and some also require heat treatment and electroplating. I don't know much about that. We usually just buy ready-made parts or have someone else process them."

"But gears and bearings are very useful. Not being able to manufacture them means that the equipment manufacturing industry is out of the question."

"Then let's just bring specialized equipment. For gears, we can use a gear hobbing machine. Bearings are more difficult..."

"A full set of equipment for a bearing factory would probably cost over ten million."

"Over ten million is a small matter. Where are you going to find so many skilled workers to do it?"

"We still have to start with indigenous methods. We should try to rely on existing equipment as much as possible. Investing in all specialized equipment is too much."

"The materials require a heat treatment furnace. The bearing cages and installing the balls can be done by hand. For fixing, a punch press will do."

...

Then they entered a more complex discussion phase. After a while of murmuring, the discussion in the Industrial Group subsided. They had probably reached a consensus on the manufacturing methods and equipment for gears and bearings. Someone started writing a list. [Xiao Zishan][y001] guessed it was probably an equipment list or something similar.

[Wen Desi][y002] spoke up at this point: "I propose that in order to unify the parts, we don't need to bring shearing machines and bending machines. A few more punch presses can replace them. We should bring as many cutting tools and grinding wheels as possible. Also, the machinery factory doesn't have a milling machine or a heat treatment furnace. These all need to be brought."

"If we want to be as complete as possible, we also need a broaching machine and a boring machine. In addition, the number of lathes should be greater," said Jiang Ye, who had been a lathe operator for eight years. "After all, the lathe is the most basic machining equipment."

"How about preparing 8 lathes?"

"That's too few, let's make it 12. This thing is very useful."

"What about a forging press? We can't do without that either."

...

While the discussion on machinery was in full swing, many people began to yawn. But constrained by the rule that they couldn't leave until the topic was over, they began to have their own small group discussions, and for a time the conference room was filled with a buzzing sound.

[Wang Luobin][y003] suddenly stood up without asking for the moderator's permission—the machinery guys in the Industrial Group had completely ignored the meeting moderator. "We also need a small foundry, we can't forget that. And we'll need to build engines in the future, so this is a must. Speaking of which, the single-cylinder diesel engine is practically a universal machine: it can plow fields and plant rice, power boats on the water, generate electricity in the mountains, and transport people and goods on the road."

"A small engine is not a big problem. A general agricultural single-cylinder engine can be made of cast iron, HT250 is fine: it has good shock absorption, good casting fluidity for easy shaping, and is easy to cut during processing."

"Speaking of casting, I thought of the problem of mold making in manufacturing. This is a professional trade. Having the equipment doesn't guarantee you can make good products; you need molds. The equipment required by the modern mold industry is too heaven-defying: 3D modeling, electrical discharge machining... This is not an easy matter."

"It's not that exaggerated. You're talking about now. In the past, the process designer would design and draw the mold drawings, then the parts would be machined, and finally assembled by fitters—the skill of the fitters was very important."

...

Slowly, the discussion on machinery subsided. The Industrial Group had used up a lot of paper, and it seemed they were all quite confident. [Wen Desi][y002] saw [Engineer Wang][y003] writing furiously with great interest and couldn't help but worry that this procurement list would be too long.

"I am [Ji Situi][y044]." A man with a full beard stood up. Although he had a full beard, his face was actually a baby face. "On behalf of the Chemical Group, I express my strong protest." He deliberately emphasized the words "Chemical Group." "The chemical industry is a very important industrial sector. How can it be lumped into the Industrial Group without distinction? They are all in machinery, and have nothing to do with us!"

"Regarding the grouping issue, we will discuss it later. First, let's hear your views on the chemical industry."

"Three acids and two alkalis. Our goal is to solve the production of these things.

"Let me first popularize some basic chemical knowledge. The chemical industry we are talking about here is heavy chemical industry, which is the foundation of all chemical industries."

This time it was the turn of the machinery personnel to yawn, but most people still watched his speech with interest.

"The chemical industry is the industry with the strongest versatility among all industrial fields. The products of the chemical industry itself are rarely end products. These products are mainly used by other industrial sectors. For example: sulfuric acid is for the fertilizer industry, soda ash is for the glass manufacturing industry, synthetic ammonia is for the explosives and fertilizer industries, and so on. As long as we can solve the manufacturing of these basic heavy chemical products, we can solve many material manufacturing problems.

"Do you know how much you rely on the chemical industry in your daily life? You don't know, which is why you lump the chemical industry and machinery together!" He shook his head, "What a tragedy!"

"Don't get so emotional. Let's just talk about the chemical industry."

"Our basic chemical equipment needs a set of synthetic ammonia and combined soda production systems and a set of coking chemical systems. These two sets of equipment can roughly meet our basic needs, especially the synthetic ammonia equipment."

"What is coking equipment?"

"A coke oven?"

"No, simply put, it is a combined manufacturing equipment that uses coal tar to produce various chemical products. It can produce sulfuric acid, phenol, nitric acid, dyes, and yes, sulfa drugs."

"Sulfa drugs are very useful. That way we'll have antibiotics."

"Of course, the output is not very high, but it is generally sufficient for normal situations."

"What about synthetic ammonia? For fertilizer?"

"It is extremely useful to us. To put it simply, without synthetic ammonia, we cannot produce nitric acid."

"Without nitric acid, we cannot produce explosives."

"Of course, there is also the fertilizer industry, which is even more dependent on synthetic ammonia."

"In addition to complete sets of equipment, we also need to prepare some spare chemical equipment: such as comprehensive towers, absorption towers, decarbonization towers, distillation towers, saturated hot water towers, various reaction kettles, pressure-resistant pipelines, acid pumps, heaters... I think we will need at least 500-600 tons of materials."

"These things, um, can't we produce them ourselves? Our machinery industry is relatively complete."

"It's a materials problem," [Ji Situi][y044] said. "Unless we can quickly produce materials like stainless steel and polyethylene, I think it will be difficult to produce chemical equipment ourselves within ten years."

"What about using glass and ceramics? The Eighth Route Army's military industry used water vats as reaction towers to make sulfuric acid. And many of the indigenous chemical equipment from the Great Leap Forward also used these things," [Luo Duo][y011] spoke up again.

"I'm not clear about that. If we have the conditions to purchase modern equipment, there is no need to use indigenous equipment. At least the production efficiency will be much higher. Even the production environment is better than the indigenous method. If any of you like to make sulfuric acid in a water vat, you'd better think carefully about your teeth."

"I would like to ask, after we have this equipment, can we establish an organic chemical industry?"

"That, I'm afraid, will be very difficult." [Ji Situi][y044] thought, *You guys are really asking for the moon. Is organic chemistry so easy to do?*

"Then we won't be able to produce nylon and synthetic rubber," someone lamented.

"What do you need nylon for, stockings?" someone joked.

"Black silk, flesh-colored silk... not a single one can be missing."

When the atmosphere began to turn into a farce, [Xiao Zishan][y001] had to once again dispel everyone's creativity and bring the topic back to the main point.

"Rubber trees take eleven years before they can be tapped, but there are many places where rubber is needed."

"We're not making condoms, why do we absolutely need rubber?"

This remark caused another burst of laughter, and the meeting once again fell into an infinite stream of discussion.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] finally managed to calm everyone down.

"I think you want organic chemistry for plastics, right?" [Ji Situi][y044] faced the person who had proposed building an organic chemical industry, and the person nodded. "Although plastic is our most common daily necessity, the organic chemistry it involves is very complex, and it is unlikely that we can make it—this is not just a problem of raw materials. However, we can manufacture celluloid and Bakelite."

"Bakelite is very useful."

"If we want to build an electrical power system, Bakelite is very useful, but rubber is also..."

"Regarding the discussion on rubber, let's have the Agriculture Group elaborate on it later."
