Shi Niaoren went to the United States the next day. As for what weapons to purchase, there were too many opinions, and a decision could not be made for a while. The North American group said they would wait for their news before taking action. In any case, it was not advisable to store the purchased weapons for too long, and it would be timely to buy them a few months before departure.

For the members of the Executive Committee, the current discussion was not satisfactory to everyone. Many people felt like they had a fishbone stuck in their throat, but they couldn't say why. None of the several plans seemed to suit their own wishes. If they were discussing military weapons, although they hadn't played with them, many of them knew a lot and could talk a great deal. But for civilian-version weapons, the vast majority of urban nerds were completely at a loss. They wanted to talk but had no theoretical basis; you could even say they were completely in the dark.

For the past few days, Jiang Ye had been pestering the members of the Executive Committee, including Xi Yazhou, lobbying everywhere to promote his package weapons plan: semi-automatic rifles + bolt-action Mosin-Nagant rifles. [Chief Wen][y002] was moved by what he said and even went to check the information on the Type 38 rifle for a while—this thing, with a bayonet attached, could form a magnificent long spear formation. Unfortunately, the group from the Sports Group had no desire to continue the revolutionary tradition of pulling a bolt. His activities among the general populace also did not receive much support—what the masses liked were weapons that could "strafe," and they didn't care whether they were automatic rifles or submachine guns, but they were firmly against bolt-action rifles—this thing made people feel insecure.

Unexpectedly, a few days later, they received a transatlantic phone call from Dr. Shi, saying that the North American group had added another member, who would be returning to China immediately to discuss weapons with everyone. He said that this person had played with more and more varied guns than Little Rui, and knew the North American civilian weapons market like the back of his hand. He was the kind of person who had fired cannons on the ground and flown a Mustang in the sky. His experiences made everyone stand in awe, not knowing what kind of deity was coming. Most people thought that the person who came would be a muscular, burly MAN.

Unexpectedly, when they picked him up and brought him back to the base, they saw a dandyish young man, with a slightly powdered and made-up look. Everyone was somewhat disappointed, and even more so, they began to doubt whether Dr. Shi was a reliable person.

The visitor introduced himself with the surname Lin and the given name Shenhe. He was a firearms enthusiast. Thanks to the decadent and backward American empire, he had been in the United States for many years and had not only played with countless famous and nameless firearms, but had even built a Nordenfelt machine gun and a 12-pounder Napoleon bronze cannon himself (of course, he participated in the manufacturing). The group of military fans around him were drooling. After he heard the Executive Committee's introduction about firearms, he first smiled leisurely, which puzzled everyone.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] saw his smile and couldn't help but think of the smile of Zhuge Liang played by Tang Guoqiang on TV. It was a pity that there was no one beside him to chime in and ask, "Why is the military advisor laughing?"

"You all don't know much about the civilian weapons market in North America, do you?" Lin Shenhe's voice was not loud, but his words were very clear. "Civilian weapons are actually very different from military weapons, and their performance varies from factory to factory." He paused for a moment and continued to explain, "Take the AR-15, for example. Everyone knows it's the civilian version of the M-16, and knows that it can't fire in bursts, it's a semi-automatic rifle. In fact, the civilian goods produced by various large and small treacherous merchants on the US market are very cunning and cannot be compared with the weapons in the hands of American soldiers at all. The barrels of the AR-15, not to mention the match-grade precision barrels, even many of the ordinary ones are not even chrome-plated.

"Another example is the M1A, the civilian version of the M-14 recommended by Xi Yazhou. It's produced by the famous Springfield Armory, and many people like it. In fact, its receivers are all investment cast, unlike the forged receivers of the military contract M14s back in the day. In contrast, the M-14s produced by our Norinco have forged receivers, but the quality is not very good."

"So the treacherous US merchants are making money by advertising with the US military, and deceiving the working masses of the US with shoddy products?"

"It's not exactly deception. The civilian gun market in North America is very large, and there is demand from people of all classes and incomes. This is different from military orders. So there are companies that take the route of simplified craftsmanship and low prices, and there are also those that make high-priced, high-quality products. For example, speaking of the civilian version of the M14, the one from LRB Arms has a forged receiver and is much more expensive than the one from Springfield Armory. Anyway, people of any income can find what they consider to be the most cost-effective thing."

After Lin Shenhe's introduction, everyone realized how complex the civilian gun market in the United States was. They couldn't help but feel a sense of respect.

"Then what is your opinion on the choice of weapons?"

"Well, that depends on what the Executive Committee's requirements for weapons are. Regarding the choice of semi-automatic rifles, I agree with Group Leader Xi's view—given the environment we will be facing, it is best to choose semi-automatic. 200 semi-automatic rifles are enough to deal with any complex situation at the beginning."

"We don't have any objections either. The problem is that choosing which semi-automatic has become a difficult problem."

"If we are talking about better cost-effectiveness, the SKS is indeed very good. The retail price is only $400, and the M43 ammunition in North America is also very cheap, suitable for large-scale equipment. And the stock of this gun is very sufficient, making it easy to purchase in large quantities."

"Didn't Little Rui say that the Mosin-Nagant is only $80 a piece? You can buy 5 for $400!" The bolt-action rifle party still persisted. "And the ammunition is even cheaper."

"Who among you has used a Mosin-Nagant?" Lin Shenhe had an all-knowing smile on his face. "Among bolt-action rifles, the Mosin-Nagant's bolt is the most difficult to open. People say you have to kick it with your foot. And bolt-action rifles require a lot of practice to become combat-effective."

"Then we can choose others... like the Lee-Enfield."

"It's not impossible. But in my opinion, bolt-action rifles would be good as equipment for a native army in the future. For us transmigrators, it's better to be well-equipped to have more confidence."

"I still oppose the weapons of the Warsaw Pact system," Xi Yazhou continued to insist on his theory. "The service life of the whole gun is too poor."

"Oh, that's not entirely true. There are indeed some very bad Warsaw Pact weapons. The key is where they are made. As far as I know, on the North American civilian gun market, the AK series produced by factories like IZMASH in Russia all have cold-hammer-forged barrels and chrome-lined bores, with a service life of over 80,000 rounds. As for the AR-15 series, only the HK416 uses a cold-hammer-forged barrel. The AK series produced by Arsenal in Bulgaria is said to have a barrel life of over 15,000 rounds. This is what I was told by an American Arsenal agent I asked before."

"Then let's buy a large number of AKs! They can also be converted to full-auto!" The AK party began to get cocky.

"I rather agree with Xi Yazhou's idea. At least some of them should be semi-automatic rifles that use full-power cartridges." Lin Shenhe unhurriedly added another word of praise. "Considering the needs of combat, Group Leader Xi's idea is quite comprehensive. It's not about the range, but that full-power rounds have a certain penetrating power against old-style houses, and are also very advantageous in dealing with enemies in the bushes. The transmigrators will need this ability in densely vegetated areas."

...

After a round of brainwashing by Lin Shenhe, the Executive Committee, whose eyes were shining, finally chose a hybrid plan:

A small number of Russian-made AK semi-automatic rifles using the 7.62mm NATO round: the Saiga-308, as the special weapon for the military group personnel.

The SKS semi-automatic using the M43 round as the weapon for the transmigrator militia—although the SKS has some performance defects, its advantage is that the ammunition is very cheap, unlike the astonishingly expensive 7.62mm NATO round. Economy is, after all, a consideration.

The SKS proposed by Lin Shenhe was the SKS-D. The superiority of this model was that it could use AK magazines, which meant it was no longer limited to its own 10-round internal magazine. The sustainability of firepower was greatly improved.

"As for handguns, the M9 is purely for show. It's better to choose the Glock. The price is cheap, the quantity is sufficient, and American police all love it. The price is less than $50."

Lin Shenhe pressed his advantage and changed the handgun originally decided by the Executive Committee to the Glock. Although the M9 was very handsome, the Glock was just as cool, so it didn't cause any objections. However, the procurement ratio was reduced from a majority to a minority. Automatic pistols would only be equipped in small numbers for military professionals. Most people would switch to S&W revolvers. Revolvers were more suitable for low-quality reloaded ammunition.

Then Lin Shenhe made many more suggestions: such as purchasing a large number of Russian-made 4x optical sights—if they wanted the rifles to be able to exert their long-range function beyond 400 meters, sights were indispensable. There were also a small number of high-magnification sniper scopes to be equipped for snipers.

"Also, we can purchase a small variety of various light weapons as blueprints for future reverse engineering, or at least as a reference material."

During this discussion, the entire Sports Group, except for Xi Yazhou, remained silent. However, after the meeting, several people proposed to go to the shooting club to shoot the M-14 and experience the effect of full-power ammunition.

"Alright, you can arrange that." [Wen Desi][y002] looked at [Xiao Zishan][y001]. "If that what-cha-ma-call-it 308 is available, arrange for everyone in the Sports Group to go and shoot it to get a feel for it."

How to get the money to the United States became another problem. Just these 200 rifles would cost $100,000. Exchanging it at a bank was obviously not an option. Fortunately, [Wen Desi][y002] had recently opened many more companies to cover the flow of funds. One of them had import and export trade rights, so he sent a few kilograms of gold over in a container under the pretext of exporting electronic products.

"Do you really trust that Dr. Shi, and Lin Shenhe?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] once asked [Wen Desi][y002] while they were walking on the sports field.

"If we don't trust them, what can we do?" [Chief Wen][y002] asked him back. "Our weapons can only rely on them. There is no other way."

"That's true," [Xiao Zishan][y001] fell silent.

"To be realistic, our entire operation is built on the basis of mutual trust," [Wen Desi][y002] took a deep breath. "If you and [Engineer Wang][y003] didn't trust me, how could you have gone through the wormhole with me? If these people didn't believe we had a wormhole, how could they have come here? Even for those who left, if we didn't trust their promise of secrecy," his face turned cold, "we should have..."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] shivered: "Be careful with your words!"

"Yes," [Chief Wen][y002] nodded. "How is Xi Yazhou recently? Is he upset?"

"No, and his proposal wasn't completely overturned. It seems he even went drinking with that Lin Shenhe. Several people went, and the atmosphere was quite lively. That Lin Shenhe has a lot of practical experience. He's a talent."

"Hmm, what about the others in the Sports Group? What are their thoughts?"

"They think we're making a big fuss over nothing, that it's all superfluous." [Xiao Zishan][y001] gave a wry smile. He had more and more family members under his charge, and from their chats, he could know many people's thoughts. "In their view, as long as there are guns to use, everything else is bullshit. So they don't have much opinion on what kind of gun to use."

"That's good. Everyone's emotions need to be stable. To be honest, everything is fine and dandy now, but I'm afraid that after we go over..." [Chief Wen][y002]'s words trailed off.

"When one holds a sharp weapon, the intent to kill arises on its own."

"That's right, especially when everyone has a gun..."

"So we need a system to manage firearms and ammunition?"

"Yes, we must have one. At least in the long run, we must have one."

"But this is actually a technical detail. Looking at the big picture, we still need a complete political system. In other words, we need a political program, a code of conduct, and so on," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said.

"Yes, so we should have a complete system... a constitution?"
