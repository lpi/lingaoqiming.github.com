As the first rays of dawn painted the sky, the *Fengcheng* was already abuzz with activity. The spectacular disappearance of the wormhole was the topic of every conversation, the shared memory of a miracle witnessed. For those who had been sealed in the cabins, a flood of digital photos and videos served as a testament to the event.

The Executive Committee had not yet given the order to weigh anchor, but the first cracks in their meticulous plans were already beginning to show. The ship's galley, designed for a crew of forty, was hopelessly inadequate for the four hundred souls now aboard the *Fengcheng*. A simple breakfast of congee was an impossibility. Long lines formed at the toilets, and some, in their desperation, resorted to relieving themselves over the sides of the smaller boats tied alongside.

"Commissioner Ma, this is unacceptable!" Bei Wei, the leader of the landing reconnaissance team, stormed onto the sterncastle, his face a mask of fury. He confronted [Ma Qianzhu][y005], the newly appointed landing commander. "All this human waste will attract sharks! The landing will be a bloodbath!"

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] sighed, a weary resignation in his eyes. "What would you have me do? There are ten toilets for four hundred people."

"If one of them falls from those rickety boats, we won't have to worry about sharks," Bei Wei shot back.

Their argument was interrupted by the arrival of "Auntie Tian," the head of the cafeteria, her face a picture of despair. "Commissioner Ma, the galley... it's impossible. There's not enough time to cook for everyone."

[Ma Qianzhu][y005], already on the defensive, felt his patience fray. "This is not my concern! Speak to [Xiao Zishan][y001]!"

"But you are the landing commander," she replied, her voice unwavering. "All matters on this ship are under your authority."

He cursed inwardly. The problem had begun at dawn, when [Li Yuanyuan][y007] from the General Affairs Group had served the Executive Committee a breakfast of freshly cooked congee and steamed buns. The masses, he knew, were not troubled by scarcity, but by inequality. To create such a divide at the very outset of their enterprise was to invite dissent. The committee members were now huddled in their cabins, eating in secret. He picked up the phone. "Engine room! Run the desalination equipment at maximum capacity! We need a full supply of fresh water!"

"A full supply?" a resentful voice shot back. "Do you want us to piss fresh water for you?" It was Xiao Bailang, a young mechanic who had been assigned to the engine room for the past three months.

*Insubordination,* [Ma Qianzhu][y005] thought, a flash of anger rising in his chest. *Just you wait, you little brat. I'll have you sold to a Thai brothel.* He took a deep breath, the anger subsiding into a familiar sense of weary frustration. He left the sterncastle and went down to the deck.

Dong Shiye sat leaning against his backpack, his legs still weak from his precarious morning ablutions. The sea had been a dizzying, churning void just below his feet. He watched the cursing, queuing crowds and felt a small sense of satisfaction. He had come prepared. He cleaned his hands with a disinfectant wipe, his teeth with floss and chewing gum. His principle was simple: rely on yourself, not the organization.

He ignored the chaotic distribution of congee, opting instead for a compressed biscuit from his own supply of military rations. To eat the congee would mean washing the bowl, a waste of precious water.

He gazed out at the coastline, a dark, unbroken line of green. This was not the Hainan of the 21st century, with its sprawling resorts and coconut-lined beaches. This was a wild, untamed land. The beach was a narrow strip of black gravel, backed by a low, fractured cliff. The shore was a dense tangle of mangroves, a primordial ecosystem untouched by human hands. And strangest of all, there was not a single coconut tree in sight. The iconic symbol of Hainan, he realized with a jolt, had not yet been introduced to this part of the island.

A commotion on the starboard side drew his attention. The landing reconnaissance team, led by Bei Wei, was preparing to depart. They were a motley crew of soldiers, engineers, and geologists, their mission to scout the terrain, chart the waters, and search for any signs of human habitation. They were armed with rifles and machetes, their faces grim and determined.

"Be careful," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said to Bei Wei at the top of the gangway.

"Don't worry," Bei Wei replied, his voice steady.

The sputter of the motorboat's engine shattered the morning's silence, a sound centuries ahead of its time.

Bei Wei had full authority over the landing. His orders were to gather information and avoid conflict. Xiong Buyou, an otaku from a manga company, had been assigned to the team as an interpreter. He was a native speaker of the Lingao dialect, a linguistic anomaly that was completely unintelligible to speakers of both Mandarin and the mainstream Hainanese dialect. It was a language that had kept Lingao isolated for centuries.

Xiong Buyou had wanted to wear his chainmail, but Bei Wei had forbidden it. The anti-stab vest was more practical.

Their maps were 400 years old, their accuracy questionable. Bei Wei decided to head for the most prominent landmark: Lingao Cape. As the motorboat sped toward the shore, the men on the *Fengcheng* watched in silence, their hearts filled with a mixture of hope and trepidation. They were pioneers on the shores of a new world, and the first steps had just been taken.
