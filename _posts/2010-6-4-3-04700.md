Thanks to the diligent efforts of the Qiwei Escort Agency, they managed to recruit enough sugar masters and other workers for the various sugar mills. Although it was late in the season and the best masters had already been hired, leaving them with the old, the young, and the less skilled, at least every mill was able to start operations for the harvest. Wen Tong informed the five mills under his name that any outside sugarcane brought for processing would be charged only thirty percent of the sugar output as a fee. This was to attract small-scale cane farmers who didn't have their own mills, allowing them to acquire more raw sugar. At the same time, he instructed all the mills to buy up any and all sugar products, including raw sugar, sugar bricks, and even the leftover molasses.

"Tell them we want the bagasse too!" Wen Tong excitedly shouted to Wen Xiu and Wen Qing, who were acting as his messengers. The two brothers, being literate and fluent in Mandarin, had become his secretaries and envoys, constantly rushing around Leizhou to deliver his orders, their faces tanned by the sun. Wen Tong wrote letters daily to the newly recruited mill and plantation managers, issuing various instructions and demanding regular reports. To facilitate communication, Liao Dahua had purchased several sedan chairs and hired a team of bearers to be on standby.

As for the temporary laborers for the sugarcane fields, Wen Tong quickly discovered that he couldn't recruit enough people locally. The wages for short-term workers skyrocketed during the harvest season, and because they had started late, most of the available labor in the countryside had already been hired by other cane farmers and plantations. Wen Tong had no choice but to wait for the workforce to be sent from Guangzhou.

Guangzhou was preparing to send the first batch of two hundred people. He had originally wanted more, but the dilapidated houses on the plantations and at the mills couldn't accommodate so many. The existing structures were in desperate need of repair, and they also had to build new kitchens and latrines. Food and drinking water had to be prepared, and even the pots for cooking had to be purchased. Arranging food and lodging for so many people in the 17th century was a daunting task, requiring a hands-on approach to everything.

Fortunately, the Qiwei Escort Agency's local branch was a great help. Liao Dahua handled everything from procuring food and hiring craftsmen to repair the houses to dealing with the local officials.

In Guangzhou, Zhang Xin put Sun Chang in charge of organizing the first group of immigrants bound for Xuwen. The letter from Xuwen had described the primitive conditions in Leizhou, where the new arrivals would not only have to harvest sugarcane but also perform various other tasks. Therefore, Sun Chang selected only young, able-bodied men without any diseases for the first batch. He specifically chose men with families, rejecting all single men. Zhang Xin, puzzled, asked him why.

"I've heard that the conditions in Leizhou are quite harsh," Sun Chang replied. "If we send unattached men, they might run off at the first sign of trouble. Wouldn't that be a waste of all our effort and money? Men with families are more stable."

"You are very thorough," Zhang Xin said, impressed by the foresight of this former house slave turned head steward.

"It's not that I'm thorough, but in my previous service in Master Gao's household, though I was just a lowly servant, I saw much of how they hired and managed people, and I am familiar with the various pitfalls."

Sun Chang had Guo Yi visit the governor's yamen and, for the price of one hundred taels of silver, obtain a name card from the aide-de-camp, Lü Yizhong. Although the several hundred able-bodied immigrants could travel to Leizhou by boat, they would inevitably have to pass through towns and villages after landing, where they would be questioned by local officials. Having an official document would make things much easier. The first group of immigrants was organized into a military-style formation of squads, platoons, and companies, with leaders appointed at each level. Each person carried their own bedding, eating utensils, and a five-day supply of dry rations.

The route was to travel by boat from Guangzhou to Haian in Leizhou, then march to Xuwen. Upon arrival, they would be assigned to the nine sugarcane plantations based on their individual circumstances.

The Qiwei Escort Agency had also made ample preparations at its various branches and outposts along the route in Leizhou. They organized a relay system, with guides meeting the immigrant group as soon as they entered the territory. Rest stops were set up along the way, providing boiled water and steamed buns. In more desolate areas without rest stops, the cooking teams would build their own fires to boil water and eat their dry rations. They were forbidden from drinking unboiled water, and lodging was arranged for every night, ensuring no one had to sleep outdoors. With this relay system, the immigrants were well-fed, well-rested, and never got lost. Escorted by the Qiwei men, who carried the official document, and armed with their own staffs and waist knives, they were not troubled by anyone on the less-than-peaceful roads of Leizhou. They reached Xuwen in less than two days, in excellent physical condition, with not a single case of illness or injury. After a short rest, they were ready to work.

Wen Tong dispersed the two hundred-plus immigrants, sending them out in squads to the various sugarcane plantations. They lived in hastily repaired thatched huts, but the warm climate of Leizhou meant they wouldn't freeze. The immigrants were immediately put to work harvesting the sugarcane. Following Wen Tong's instructions, sufficient rice, vegetables, and meat were purchased from the nearby villages to ensure the immigrants were well-fed during the busy season. Harvesting sugarcane was strenuous work; if they weren't fed properly, people would quickly lose their strength and run away.

After the first batch of immigrants had settled in and worked for half a month, and seeing that morale was stable, Guangzhou began sending the second batch. This group included the wives and children of the men in the first group. The women were sent primarily to handle the logistical needs of the immigrants, such as cooking and mending clothes.

In the end, about four hundred people, men, women, and children, were transported from Guangzhou. Wen Tong, Chang Shide, and Liao Dahua gradually dispersed and settled them on the various sugarcane plantations as long-term laborers—in reality, they were indentured servants. Each person had signed a contract acknowledging a debt of fifty taels of silver to the Zi Corporation, which they had to repay with their labor. Guo Yi believed this model would, to some extent, curb the tendency of some refugees to run away after getting their fill of food.

The policy of recruiting refugees had been quite successful at the beginning, especially when the turnover rate to Lingao was fast. The starving refugees were happy to go to a new place where there was work and food. But as the transport speed slowed and more and more people accumulated in the refugee camps in Guangzhou, after a few square meals, they regained their strength. Hearing that they would be sent to Hainan Island, many who were attached to their homeland began to think of escaping. They had come to Guangzhou to avoid starvation; now that they were fed and with spring approaching, some began to slip away. The Guangzhou station was initially helpless—they didn't have enough manpower to guard these people. But the situation couldn't be allowed to continue, or it would quickly become a trend. Guo Yi and the others came to a conclusion: carrots alone were not enough—they needed a stick.

To minimize the number of refugees escaping, in addition to increasing various brainwashing measures and promoting the wonderful prospects of life in Hainan, Guo Yi finally requested and received permission from the Executive Committee to implement a system of indentured servitude.

All refugees taken in had to sign a contract, borrowing money to pay for their food, clothing, shelter, and medical services in the camp. In return, they had to serve the Zi Corporation for at least seven years, after which they could get their contracts back.

According to the contract, their food was provided free of charge during this period, and they were also paid wages. At the end of the term, they did not have to pay any additional redemption fee.

With this contract, Guo Yi could legally use the power of the government in Guangzhou to control them, making the common people, who were particularly afraid of the authorities, dare not escape at will. This was especially effective after he used Liang Cunhou's name card to report a dozen or so escaped refugees to the Nanhai county yamen. Each was given forty to eighty strokes of the cane at the yamen, which effectively curbed the escapes and completely extinguished the idea of returning home for many. Others gradually began to question the point of desperately returning to their hometowns to eat bran and vegetables and pay rent—if they had to work the land, wasn't it better to work for a master like Patron Guo, who at least provided enough food and new clothes?

After nearly a month of continuous effort, the transmigrator group's sugar industry in Haikang and Xuwen counties was finally on track. Although there were some frustrating incidents where a large amount of sugar was ruined due to the poor skills of the sugar masters, the overall operation was stable. Raw sugar was being produced continuously. Following Wen Tong's instructions, all the raw sugar, molasses, and bagasse produced in the mills were transported to the central sugarcane plantation in Xuwen. Liao Dahua, following his instructions, had managed to acquire some land to expand the plantation's territory to the riverbank—if they couldn't get steam or diesel engines, they planned to use water power for pressing.

Wen Tong planned to build a model sugarcane plantation here and a sugar factory with new equipment. He named it the South China Model Sugar Factory—in commemoration of the first modern sugar factory in Xuwen, the South China Factory. He also named the other four mills after several shareholders of that factory who had made significant contributions to the modernization of China's sugar industry: Guoxin Factory, Qichong Factory, Zhi'an Factory, and Qiwen Factory. For the time being, these factories would continue to use the old production methods, with technical improvements to be made after the model factory was running smoothly.

Thus, the South China Model Sugarcane Plantation became the place that received the most immigrants, with nearly one hundred and fifty men, women, and children settling there. Since Chang Shide knew nothing about growing sugarcane, he became the administrator of civil affairs. He went from plantation to plantation, registering households according to the "Civil Affairs Management and Organization Manual" compiled by Wu De, establishing grassroots organizations, and selecting elderly and virtuous people from among the immigrants to be village chiefs, and witty and eloquent people to be their deputies. Following the principle of universal military service, he established a militia—or "village braves" as they were called locally. They were equipped with swords, spears, bows and arrows, and even matchlock guns brought from Lingao. Under the guidance of the escorts, the militiamen trained in their spare time. Wen Tong didn't need them to be a musketeer unit; he just wanted them to be able to defend themselves when bandits attacked. Although Chang Shide and Wen Tong were deeply skeptical about the loyalty of this militia, the security situation in the area left them no choice. Relying on a few escorts to protect nine properties in two counties was far beyond the capabilities of the Qiwei Escort Agency in Leizhou.

"Even if it's not for us, we can only hope they'll do it for themselves," Chang Shide said. "At least now they have food and clothing, and their families are reunited. They should be willing to put in the effort to protect their own homes."

"That's if they consider this place their home," Wen Tong was still rather pessimistic.

"The two managers are worrying too much," Liao Dahua tried to reassure them. "They have food and shelter here, the climate is warm, there's no frost or snow—it's a good place. And they've met benevolent masters like you. What more could these refugees hope for?"

"Let's hope so," Wen Tong said, looking at the newly built, scattered, African-style thatched huts. "After this harvest season, we'll build new houses for all the plantations, according to the standard B-type housing."

"The investment is too large—" Chang Shide had seen the B-type buildings constructed for Baitu Village in Bopu. They were practically fortresses, much larger in scale than the dormitory-style A-type buildings.

"The sugar factory will be our cash cow in the future. To establish a firm foothold in Leizhou, we need some self-defense capabilities," Wen Tong said. Next, he would start improving the technology and machinery—that was the only way to make his South China Sugar Factory worthy of its name.

Wen Tong now had two directions for improvement. The first was to produce white sugar. Wen Tong knew several methods for making white sugar, but without equipment, he could only use the traditional method from the "Tiangong Kaiwu," using yellow mud as an adsorbent. This "yellow mud" was likely a porous material like clay. From this perspective, it didn't necessarily have to be yellow mud; activated carbon, diatomaceous earth, and other such materials could also serve as adsorbents.

The second was to increase the yield of raw sugar. There were many areas for improvement here. The simplest way was to increase the juice extraction rate. Wen Tong had roughly estimated that the juice extraction rate of the sugarcane after being pressed three times by the mill's wooden rollers was no more than 40%. The so-called bagasse still contained a large amount of sugarcane juice, which was a huge waste. Modern sugar factories had an extraction rate of at least 70%.

After much consideration, he decided to start with making white sugar—after all, it had a higher profit margin.

Wen Tong didn't try to experiment with various random adsorbents. They couldn't produce activated carbon yet, and diatomaceous earth would have to be shipped from Lingao, which was inconvenient. Yellow mud and other types of clay, while not available everywhere, were easy to find locally. If it didn't work, he would think of something else.

Following the process described in the "Tiangong Kaiwu," Wen Tong first had the raw sugar melted down and then poured into an earthenware funnel with a straw plug at the bottom. Once the raw sugar had completely solidified, the straw was removed. Chang Shide had someone bring several loads of pure yellow mud from outside, which was poured into a water tank and vigorously stirred into a slurry. After letting it settle for a moment, he used a ladle to scoop up the solution from the top layer of the yellow mud water and poured it, spoonful by spoonful, into the funnel.

"This method is so strange," Chang Shide was a bit skeptical. Could pouring yellow mud water over brown sugar really produce white sugar? It just looked dirty.
