Though the yamen runners acted like tyrants over the common folk, their power was entirely dependent on the system. When faced with a "hard target" that the system couldn't control, they were powerless. The Australians, naturally, had no regard for the Ming system, and the runners, being perceptive, fell in line. Wu De had anticipated potential riots, but after seeing the glint of spears and sabers surrounding them, they complied without a single complaint, obediently forming lines and marching out of the city. Even the ropes prepared for binding them went unused.

The section chiefs and key members received special treatment: they were bound directly and thrown into ox-carts to be hauled away. They would enjoy private rooms in the "study class."

The destination for the runners was this "study class," which was, of course, not for "studying." Its main purpose was for screening and interrogation. Before their final disposition, Wu De intended to extract as much information as possible from them.

As for the Six Offices, the Household Office had been completely taken over by a special team from the Planning Committee. Because it dealt with the county's finances, all personnel except for the arrested Chen Minggang and his "grain collectors" were temporarily retained for later cleanup. Zhou Qi's official appointment as the Household Registrar hadn't been issued yet, but he had already taken charge of the place—under the escort of the Transmigration Group's bayonets, of course.

Wu De didn't trust Zhou Qi either. In his view, no one from the old system could be entrusted with significant responsibility. Zhou Qi was merely a temporary, transitional figure. Wu De had a different plan for how the Household Office would be managed and how future tax collection would be conducted.

The staff of the Punishments Office were all temporarily retained, but its scribe, Zhang Shi, had been arrested, primarily due to his connection with Chen Minggang. As Chen Minggang's brother-in-law, he couldn't be allowed to remain in such a position. It was better to arrest the wrong person than to let a potential threat slip through.

The scribes of the other offices were needed to handle daily government business. After being summoned to the yamen, Xiong Buyou announced that they were to continue their work, "serving the Emperor and the court with all their hearts." However, they were forbidden from leaving the yamen. All retained staff from the various offices were treated similarly.

"Although the Personnel Office staff will remain, you must immediately send someone to take control and prevent them from moving any files," Wu De instructed Zhou Botao.

The Personnel Office controlled the entire county's personnel system, including the village chiefs, security heads, and local officials, as well as the records of the yamen's own clerks. All appointments, promotions, transfers, and salary adjustments had to pass through their hands. It was the equivalent of a modern county's Human Resources Bureau and Organization Department combined, wielding considerable power.

For the Transmigration Group to clearly grasp the Ming's "local cadre" system in Lin'gao, the archives of this department were crucial. The county's main archive room was also placed under guard.

Another critical location was the county treasury. The treasurer was among those arrested that night. After his capture, he was immediately imprisoned in the yamen to await his fate. The Planning Committee wasn't optimistic about how much money and grain they would find in the county granary, but there was bound to be something. And the treasurer's personal wealth was unlikely to be insignificant.

As for the other yamen functionaries—jailers, coroners, executioners, granary keepers, and the like—they were all considered specialized personnel. Although corruption existed at every level, purging them was not an immediate priority. They were retained for the time being.

That night, the Lin'gao county yamen was ablaze with lights, bustling with activity until dawn. The county's residents locked their doors, too afraid to peek outside, and an atmosphere of tense anxiety enveloped the town. Xiong Buyou directed everything from his post in the yamen, swamped with work.

Wu Mingjin and Wang Zhaomin had no idea what was happening in the front yamen. After the noon interrogation in the hall concluded, Wu Ya reported the entire sequence of events. The outcome was rather satisfactory to the magistrate.

"It seems the Australians understand the key to local governance. Appeasing the gentry is the top priority," Wang Zhaomin commented.

But Wu Mingjin's brow was furrowed with worry. "Appeasing the gentry is a good thing, but with Chen Minggang dismissed and a host of grain collectors removed, what's to become of the half-collected autumn levy?"

"You need not worry about that, my lord," Wang Zhaomin said confidently. "Since they dared to arrest Chen Minggang, they must have a plan."

Wang Zhaomin volunteered to negotiate with the Australians, demanding a practical solution for the autumn tax payment, and then report back.

"Just don't let them stir up any more trouble," Wu Mingjin sighed. He felt his official career was becoming far too thrilling. The good mood cultivated over half a year of laissez-faire governance had all but evaporated.

By the afternoon, he was plunged into panic. A servant suddenly reported that the front and back of the yamen had been sealed off. Even the passage to the front yamen was guarded, with no one allowed in or out.

"They're wearing the uniforms of the Zao Ban, but I don't recognize a single one of them!" the servant reported.

"What is this?" Wu Mingjin was stunned. What were they doing?

"Bring Mr. Wang here!"

The servant left and returned moments later, reporting that the passage to Mr. Wang's courtyard was also blocked. No one was allowed in or out.

Wu Mingjin's fluctuating emotions once again sank into despair. His fantasy of peacefully coexisting with the Kun bandits until his term ended was shattered. It seemed they were truly rebelling this time. He just didn't know if they would force him to accept a puppet position. This dreadful thought, which had been tormenting him since morning, filled him with fear. Though he was prepared to die rather than submit, when death was truly at the door, it was hard to face one's own fear.

That night, everyone in the yamen spent a sleepless night. Wu Mingjin didn't close his eyes once, listening fearfully to the sounds from the front yamen. However, apart from an increase in footsteps, the slaughter and looting he expected never occurred. As dawn broke, Wu Mingjin got up in his office—he hadn't returned to his inner quarters to avoid his family's questions—and quickly washed his face. A servant brought breakfast and asked, "Scribe Wang has arrived. Shall I show him in?"

"Of course! Bring him in immediately." Wu Mingjin almost didn't want to eat, but then he thought Scribe Wang probably hadn't eaten either. "Tell the kitchen to prepare another portion."

Wang Zhaomin, however, said he had already eaten. He didn't look frightened at all; in fact, he seemed rather pleased with himself. Wu Mingjin couldn't help but feel suspicious. *Did Scribe Wang help the Kun bandits with something last night? They are known for their generosity...*

Scribe Wang, oblivious to his master's suspicions, quickly relayed the important news he had heard that morning.

"The Australians have taken full responsibility for the autumn levy," he said, knowing this was the magistrate's biggest concern. "They will advance the payment for any shortfall in the county's collection..."

"Advance the payment?!" Wu Mingjin was astonished. Including the official quota and wastage allowance, they would need at least twelve or thirteen thousand *dan* of unhusked rice. This was Lin'gao, not the southern heartlands. Not only was the population sparse, but the land's yield was pitiful. Even if the Kun bandits had their own secret farming methods, they had over ten thousand of their own people to feed...

"That's right," Wang Zhaomin said, clearly confident in the Transmigration Group's abilities. "Master Xiong and a gentleman from the Delong Grain Company will be here shortly to discuss the autumn levy with you, my lord."

"What's their interest rate?" Wu Mingjin knew nothing came for free. Advancing tax payments was not unheard of. In some counties, if the court demanded wheat for the summer tax when the local wheat was only harvested in autumn, the county would borrow grain from large landowners and repay them after the harvest, with interest, of course.

"No interest." Wang Zhaomin's face beamed with pride. "Master Xiong said that because of the Chen Minggang affair, the tax collection needs to be reorganized. To avoid missing the deadline, they will first advance the full amount, including the wastage allowance. They will even handle the transportation and delivery to the official granaries."

Handling the transportation and delivery was a huge undertaking, involving significant miscellaneous fees and the constant threat of extortion from the boatmen. It was a major headache for Wu Mingjin every year. If the Australians were willing to take it on, it would be a huge relief. No wonder Wang Zhaomin looked so pleased.

Wu Mingjin suddenly remembered. "There was a lot of noise in the front yamen last night, and the front and back were sealed off. What on earth happened?"

"Something big happened." Xiong Buyou had summoned Wang Zhaomin early that morning and given him a rough account of the events.

"What?!" Wu Mingjin slammed his hand on the table and shot up. "How dare they! Whose county is this, anyway?"

Overnight, they had arrested so many yamen runners. Dismissing Chen Minggang was one thing, but to arrest the heads of the Three Classes and the Punishments Office scribe as well? This was outright rebellion!

It wasn't that he was particularly loyal to or fond of these men—quite the opposite, they were all unsavory characters. But for the Australians to arrest them all without even a word to him was a blatant disregard for the authority of the government!

"My lord!" Wang Zhaomin said. "It seems the Australians intend to intervene in the yamen's affairs..."

"Hmph, this is 'holding the Son of Heaven hostage to command the nobles'..." Wu Mingjin stopped himself. He was hardly the "Son of Heaven," and saying so would be treasonous. But Wang Zhaomin understood his meaning. The Australians were hollowing out the yamen, seizing its administrative power completely. From now on, they could operate legitimately under the name of the Ming's Lin'gao County. It was a brilliant scheme.

In the core territories of the Ming Dynasty, this trick might not have succeeded. But in a remote southern county like Lin'gao, where the emperor was far away, it was a different story. The area was vast and sparsely populated, almost isolated from the outside world. Trade was underdeveloped, and population movement was minimal. News traveled slowly, and the local gentry were largely unsophisticated, with little success in the imperial examinations and no influence in official circles.
