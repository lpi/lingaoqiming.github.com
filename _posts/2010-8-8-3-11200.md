Xin Nari once again displayed his cleverness. Instead of running from the village entrance, he jumped into a small river by the village and swam to safety.

In addition to the work team itself, the Executive Committee had also dispatched a bandit suppression detachment to support the operation. In fact, most of the soldiers didn't even get a chance to fire their weapons before the battle was over. Du Wen and Dong Weiwei maintained a stern expression in front of outsiders, but they were actually overjoyed—this was a great victory, and it was all under their own management!

After this battle, the stalemate in Daolu Village was completely broken. This victory not only lay in the annihilation of the bandit gang, but also took the opportunity to wipe out the family forces of several bandit leaders who had long been entrenched in the Thirteen Villages area. The work in Daolu Village progressed by leaps and bounds. The militia that Du Wen had longed for was quickly organized, and the construction of the earthen wall began. The village administration, which had been fraught with difficulties, suddenly became a favorable situation where "the whole village obeyed orders without question." It was like a domino effect; after one fell, a chain reaction followed. The work team's activities in the other areas of the Thirteen Villages suddenly encountered no resistance and proceeded very smoothly.

Du Wen unceremoniously wielded the "iron fist of dictatorship," first sweeping away the bandits' families in the village—the cloth strips hanging on the doors became the best identification marks. Those who were not killed, regardless of gender or age, were all tied up in strings and escorted back to Bairen City by the detachment—there was an urgent need for hard labor there.

"The children too?" asked the officer in charge of transporting the prisoners.

"Of course, take them all. The Executive Committee will decide how to deal with them back there," Du Wen was happy to carry out a thorough cleanup, getting rid of all the people she considered problematic. As for how to deal with the children, let Wen Desi worry about that.

Du Wen had originally intended to deal with all the bandits' families in the Thirteen Villages area in the same way, but she was stopped by Dong Weiwei. "They didn't participate in the riot. We shouldn't be too extreme. Let's leave them a way out."

"We must cut the weeds and dig up the roots! The families of these bad elements are all full of bad intentions. They will all be sources of social instability in the future..."

"It's unnecessary and will lose us the people's support," Dong Weiwei insisted. "History tells us that expanding the scope of a movement and implicating the nine clans will only be counterproductive."

"But not carrying out a purge and being boundlessly lenient is harmful." The two women, who had embraced in victory less than five minutes ago, began a new round of arguments.

In the end, they reached a compromise. Du Wen began to spare no effort in promoting the campaign of "entering the villages and households, investigating the roots, and making everyone pass the test" in all the villages. Every day, she took the newly formed Daolu Village militia and a portion of the guards to the various villages: holding meetings, organizing militias, cleaning up the household registration, ordering the bandits who had fled home and their families to register and surrender, and investigating the property and grain hidden by the bandits' families.

Because the other villages had not participated in Xin Nari's counterattack and had no other connection with the bandits, they were dealt with much more leniently than Daolu Village. Only a few bandits with blood debts were purged. For ordinary bandits, as long as they handed over the looted property and grain and signed a letter of guarantee, they could be let go. Then, at a village-wide meeting, it was announced that those who had had minor involvement with the bandits in the past or had helped them transport stolen goods would all be pardoned, as long as they had not participated in this counterattack and there was no public outrage. They also did not have to return the money, grain, and property they had received in the past—these people had gained little, and it had been a long time. Pursuing the matter would be endless and would not be conducive to quickly stabilizing the people's hearts.

Sending Dong Weiwei as the deputy team leader was indeed a wise decision. Although Dong Weiwei constantly argued with Du Wen over specific matters, she effectively curbed Du Wen's enthusiasm for mass movements. Overall, things were carried out in a relatively moderate and orderly manner, without any excessive actions. Wu De, who had originally been skeptical about sending two women to lead a work team, was now full of admiration for Ma Qianzhu.

"The 'Viceroy' is truly the 'Viceroy'," he said this in the farm's bar.

As for the confiscated houses, land, and property, Du Wen had originally wanted to take the opportunity to carry out a small-scale land reform and distribute the land. But this was intercepted by a special commissioner sent by the Planning Committee.

"These are all the spoils of war of the transmigrators. How to deal with them must be decided by the Executive Committee."

"Flies!" Du Wen muttered in dissatisfaction. Although the Planning Committee was run by the most beloved Commissioner Ma, the people under him were not well-liked by most. Whether it was distributing supplies in normal times or receiving supplies after a battle, this group of people always displayed their penny-pinching characteristics—and they always managed to appear at every place with a major harvest at the fastest speed.

A lot of property was dug up from the village, but not much grain. The Planning Committee left a portion for the work team to carry out relief work in the village. Every household in the village was given some grain and silver. Families who had been harmed by the bandits and had lost family members received extra compensation.

Lu Ruohua made the sign of the cross in the street and led people to collect the bodies, with a look of compassion on his face. However, he was the greatest hero of this victory. During her regular confession, Old Lady Mei had told him about Zhao Dachong's visit to them to inquire about the work team's situation. In the end, she also mentioned that Zhao Dachong had asked Old Man Mei to be a spy.

Lu Ruohua knew that the matter was serious and went to discuss it with Bai Duolu. According to the rules, the content of a confession should not be revealed to a third party, but the Jesuits had long been granted an exemption in this regard. Bai Duolu quickly reported this information to Dong Weiwei.

That night, the work team summoned Old Man Mei for questioning. The half-dead-with-fear Old Man Mei quickly confessed everything. Based on the information provided by Old Man Mei, everyone unanimously concluded that the bandit gang was about to launch a counterattack.

At that time, Dong Weiwei sent a telegram to Bairen City, requesting the dispatch of a bandit suppression detachment for support, and if possible, to encircle and annihilate them. At this time, a member of the work team came to report: Liu Si had been absent-minded recently, often hiding in the ancestral hall and not going out, even too lazy to go to the widow Zhou's house, where he used to often help out. After hearing this abnormal state, the two women, combined with the news from Old Man Mei, knew that something was definitely wrong with Liu Si.

Liu Si, who was from a humble background, was no match for the cunning and shrewd modern people. He was caught off guard by a few half-true, half-false words from Du Wen, coupled with a half-baked interpretation of body language learned from the FBI. Liu Si thought that the matter had been completely exposed—he was originally unwilling to become a bandit. Under Du Wen's "patient and systematic guidance," Liu Si knelt on the ground in tears and confessed everything, even the fact that he was actually trying to pick up girls while doing mass work. Du Wen had always looked down on people who messed around with men and women. At that time, she really wanted to kick him in the crotch and then "permanently expel him from the party." But with Dong Weiwei's strong persuasion, she finally decided to let Liu Si "atone for his crime by meritorious service"—after all, it was a good opportunity to play the game of "Infernal Affairs."

Of course, for Liu Si, this merit was not so easy to achieve. But Du Wen promised that after the successful suppression of the bandits, she would no longer pursue the matter of his womanizing and guaranteed that it would not be recorded in his personal file.

As for the bribe, it was naturally confiscated and turned over to the public. Liu Si did not dare to argue and had to honestly play the role of a double agent.

After the successful luring of the enemy, Liu Si also received a reward. Du Wen had a private talk with him:

"Little Liu, although you made a mistake this time, your attitude is good." Du Wen paused, and Liu Si quickly stood up. "Thank you for the organization's trust in me! I will definitely turn over a new leaf and redouble my efforts to contribute to the Senate..."

"Alright, alright," Du Wen waved her hand. "Your matter, the merits and demerits cancel each other out. As I said before, it will not be pursued again. However, you also need to give the widow Zhou an explanation. Just get married. It's not good for the masses to see you sneaking around all the time!"

"Yes, I'll choose an auspicious day..." he immediately stopped himself. Chief Du hated these things the most.

"It's good to pick a day," Du Wen was in a good mood and didn't care about these things. "Also, the organization has decided that since you are marrying a local woman, you should just stay here and do local work. Daolu Village is a new area, you will be the village chief!"

"Thank you for the promotion and important appointment from the organization!" Liu Si stood up excitedly. If it weren't for the fact that kowtowing was not practiced here, he would probably have kowtowed several times.

"Work hard in the future. First, do a good job in Daolu Village, and then we will gradually expand to other villages." The situation in the Thirteen Villages was very good now. The next focus of the work team was to conduct social surveys. They would not have time to deal with the specific affairs of the village anymore. It should not be a big problem to hand it over to Liu Si.

However, under the many favorable circumstances, there was also a side effect that dissatisfied Du Wen: the number of baptisms had greatly increased. From the original Mei couple, the whole village was now scrambling to go to the church to listen to the teachings and be baptized. Lu Ruohua was so happy that he thanked God every night. He also looked at Bai Duolu with new eyes. Bai Duolu was miserable. He was now being "bombed" by Father Lu every day, who wanted him to take vows to become a monk.

"With your talent, your devotion to God, and your contribution to the spread of the gospel, the future Archbishop of Guangdong will be none other than you, and you will also be the abbot of several wealthy monasteries..."

Bai Duolu thought to himself that in the past, Wen Zong wanted me to be the Bishop of Lin'gao, and now Lu Ruohua says the Archbishop of Guangdong is none other than me. Is the Pope going to give me a red hat in the future? No, if I really wear a red hat, according to the thinking of people like Wen Desi, they will definitely spare no effort to make me the Pope... At this thought, Bai Duolu felt a little guilty, but he also fantasized about it for a moment. Then he thought that if he really became a clergyman, he would have no wife—everything else was negotiable, but this he could never agree to.

During the days when Du Wen was carrying out the purge of the bandits, and the people were in a state of panic and every family was uneasy, Lu Ruohua did not miss the opportunity to enter the various villages in the area to preach the gospel. This time, he was no longer alone—the converts of Daolu Village, although they were not very clear about the basic doctrines, had already paved the way for his missionary work. A group of middle-aged and elderly women, with crosses around their necks, followed Father Lu and adopted a door-to-door, street-sweeping approach, carrying out a mass movement-style evangelism of "everyone listening to the gospel."

"Everyone must go deep into every household, to the fields, and spread the gospel of God to every lost sheep," Lu Ruohua said to a group of middle-aged and elderly women with extremely devout eyes, who were also carrying a bag full of missionary leaflets.

His missionary group followed behind Du Wen, taking advantage of the lingering prestige of the transmigrators to move around everywhere. Many people, in order to quickly establish a relationship with the transmigrator group, rushed to Lu Ruohua to be baptized without even knowing what God and the Holy Mother were. The catechumenate class was overcrowded every day, and they had to have classes in the courtyard. Bai Duolu's voice was almost hoarse. Once the mass-produced converts were baptized, they all immediately asked for a cross to hang around their necks. Some even took several and hung one on their main gate. The crosses that Lu Ruohua had brought with him were soon all gone, and he quickly wrote a letter back to Macau to order a large batch.

Du Wen was furious and repeatedly wanted to expel this foreign monk and draw a clear line. But it was undeniable that the foreign monk's preaching of doctrines like "forgiveness" and "love" had played a role in stabilizing society. With Dong Weiwei's persuasion, she finally endured it. Besides, most of the missionaries who came were middle-aged and elderly women, so it was not convenient for her to order people to use force.

In this great leap forward of evangelism, Lu Ruohua also developed the first batch of "nuns": some lonely, middle-aged and elderly women who, after this turmoil, wanted to become nuns to cultivate for the next life. There were no large temples in Lin'gao, and even nunneries were rare. This newly emerged foreign religion came at the right time. The foreign monk spoke kindly, sang beautiful songs, and had many beautiful pictures—Lu Ruohua had taken down the real estate advertisement pages that Bai Duolu used to wrap his books. After he described heaven and the resurrection, some people asked to become "foreign nuns."

Lu Ruohua simply took them in and temporarily considered them as church staff. At least in the future, someone would take care of the chores like cleaning the church, cooking, and washing clothes.

One day, Lu Ruohua came to find Bai Duolu.

"Has your monastery been established?"

Bai Duolu was speechless. The so-called Australian church was just a concept. Where would a monastery come from? He had to make an excuse, "There is no monastery here yet."

"Let's establish one. There are many lambs here who want to choose the path of lifelong service to the Lord," Lu Ruohua made the sign of the cross. "Please go and discuss it with He Ying."

He Ying did not dare to neglect the matter after receiving Bai Duolu's telegram. This matter involved the future of the church's power, so he quickly went to the Executive Committee for instructions.

"What do you think?" Wen Desi asked He Ying in return.

If He Ying were to rely on his social experience from another time and space, he would definitely say, "I have the same opinion as you." But that was not necessary here.

"Let's do it," He Ying said. "After this bandit suppression, there will definitely be many orphans of the bandits left in the villages. We can't kill these children, and it's a disaster to educate them ourselves. It's better to let the monastery adopt and raise them. It won't waste resources, and we can also brainwash them by the way. Using the hell of the afterlife to control them is more effective than using our swords and guns. It's a win-win situation."
