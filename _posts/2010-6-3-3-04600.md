Chang Shide was half-lying, half-reclining on the bed. He had drunk some sobering soup, and though he still felt a bit dizzy, he was in high spirits. Just as he was about to fall asleep, Wen Xiu entered the room silently. He was wearing only a thin undershirt, his hair untied and combed back, his face flushed like a peach blossom, his almond eyes full of springtime allure. Chang Shide was momentarily stunned, unsure what to make of his appearance.

Wen Xiu curtsied like a woman and whispered, "Wen Xiu is here to serve the master in his sleep." With that, he moved to help him undress, his small, soft hands gently kneading his body, cooing in a thousand charming ways, "Master—"

Chang Shide froze for about five seconds. Suddenly, all the alcohol seemed to evaporate from his pores. A chill shot up from his heels to his head, and goosebumps erupted all over his body.

"No—" he let out a mournful cry, pushing Wen Xiu away and scrambling off the bed. *Mamma mia*, what kind of era was this? A servant sexually harassing his master! If it were a maid, he might have let it slide, but it was a man! As pretty as Wen Xiu was, he was still a man.

The small commotion led to chaos. Zhou Shizhai burst through the door. Seeing the scene, the escort's face changed dramatically. He quickly said, "Please, enjoy yourself, Master," and retreated with his head bowed.

"No, Old Zhou, let me explain—" Chang Shide, shoeless, chased after him. Outside, Li Biao was peeking in, and several other escorts had gathered in the courtyard, armed with swords and clubs.

"What are you looking at? Get back!" Zhou Shizhai waved his hand impatiently, then turned to the disheveled Chang Shide. "Chief Chang, your appearance is rather unsightly—"

"Yes, yes, I know." He hurried back to put on his shoes.

Wen Tong also came out. He had been drafting a report on improving sugar production by lamplight. Hearing the noise, he came out, still trying to figure out what was happening. He saw Wen Xiu, his clothes in disarray, emerging from Chang Shide's room with a wronged expression. He immediately misunderstood and his face darkened.

"Old Chang, I always knew you were a bit of a flirt, but I never thought you had *this* kind of hobby!" Wen Tong didn't discriminate against gay people, but he held those who would sleep with anyone for physical pleasure in contempt.

"It's not what you think!" Chang Shide was so frantic he was scratching his head, feeling like he could die. It was clearly this damned effeminate man who had tried to harass him, so why did everyone think he was the one with designs on the man's chrysanthemum?

"Old Wen, you have to believe your revolutionary comrade! You can't possibly not believe me, right? We were roommates in Lingao! You know what kind of person I am!"

"It's hard to say. Once a person is separated from the collective, many of their ugly true natures are exposed."

"I've been wronged—" Chang Shide pointed to the heavens and the earth, swearing oaths and explaining until he finally managed to convince Wen Tong that it was Wen Xiu who had harassed him. Just then, Liao Dahua arrived. Chang Shide, frustrated at being wrongly accused, couldn't help but complain to him, which led to him cursing out Guo Yi as well—why on earth would he send a "rabbit" to serve them?

Liao Dahua chuckled. "Master Chang, no need to be angry. The boys must have misunderstood. It's common for children like them, who are trained to serve masters, to attend to them during the day and serve as concubines at night. Yesterday, Manager Wen said he didn't want to buy maids and that it would be more convenient to have servant boys on the road. That's probably where the misunderstanding arose. Since you have no such intentions, I will give them a good scolding."

"What? Things like that happen?" Chang Shide's perception of ancient sexual mores was seismically shaken.

"It's quite common. Scholars who travel with their books, swords, and zithers often bring a young boy along. It's convenient for errands on the road, and at night, when they can't bear it, they use them to relieve their urges. High officials in the court also keep them. Some are so intimate that they are favored even more than concubines."

"What the hell kind of society is this!" Chang Shide couldn't help but swear.

Liao Dahua just stood by, smiling apologetically. He knew that Wen Xiu was too eager to curry favor and had offered himself up, but it had backfired spectacularly. It seemed neither of the two masters was interested in men. He mentally noted that he needed to find some maids for them quickly.

The storm of that night passed. At first, Chang Shide was a bit paranoid, afraid that his manly image would be mocked. But he later realized that the locals had no interest in gossiping about such matters. Even Wen Xiu came to bring him his wash water the next day as if nothing had happened. Perhaps, as Liao Dahua had said, it was simply not a big deal.

The next day, the two of them continued their journey by sedan chair, protected by the men from the Qiwei Escort Agency. They spent nearly half a month inspecting the various sugarcane plantations and sugar mills under their name, getting a preliminary understanding of the situation. The journey was arduous and dusty, and they even encountered several robbery attempts, but thanks to the protection of the Qiwei escorts, they passed through without any real danger.

The situation at the various plantations and mills was largely the same. Some still had a few long-term laborers, while others were completely deserted. Wen Tong now understood the state of Leizhou's sugar industry: it was a typical model where the mill was integrated with the plantation. There were no independent mills that only processed sugar. They were all attached to sugarcane plantations, either owned by a large cane farmer or a landlord, or jointly operated by several farmers. The mills primarily processed the cane from their own land, with some capacity for outside processing. The equipment utilization rate was very low, so they were all small-scale and poorly equipped.

The sugarcane fields were not cultivated under the common tenancy system. Small plots were farmed by the cane farmers themselves, who hired temporary laborers during the busy season. Larger plots were managed entirely by landlords who hired long-term laborers, a nascent form of agricultural wage labor.

Thus, when the land changed hands, the entire labor force disappeared, which was completely different from the tenancy system where the tenants remained even when the landlord changed. This created an urgent need to replenish the labor force.

One day, the group returned to the plantation in Xuwen. Coincidentally, Zhang Xin, the liaison from the Guangzhou station, had also arrived. As the future main seller of Leizhou's white sugar, the Guangzhou station was paying close attention to this venture.

Following a proposal from the Guangzhou station and approval from the Executive Committee, Wen Tong and Chang Shide formally established the Leizhou Sugar Company in Xuwen. The capital for the company was allocated from the Guangzhou station. The sugarcane plantation outside Xuwen city would serve as the company's headquarters. Wen Tong planned to conduct a pilot project for sugar industry improvement in Xuwen.

"Can you produce white sugar?" Zhang Xin was very concerned about this and asked repeatedly.

"No problem. We can produce white sugar better than any other company in Guangdong," Wen Tong said with great confidence. "But to have a price advantage, we'll need the machinery department to help us build the equipment."

"Some Englishmen have recently arrived in Guangzhou," Zhang Xin informed him. "They are being very cautious and are looking to buy goods. White sugar is one of the major commodities. If we can produce sugar before April, selling twenty or thirty tons won't be a problem."

"We can do it, but I need enough manpower from the Guangzhou station," Wen Tong said. "It's difficult to supplement the labor force locally."

"How many people do you need?"

"At least three hundred." In Wen Tong's plan, this group would be the first batch of workers for the sugarcane farms and the sugar factory. Each plantation needed to be supplemented with at least twenty laborers, and those with mills needed even more.

"All able-bodied men?"

"Women and children too. That will help keep the young men here. Besides, the farm women from Guangdong and Fujian are very capable and strong; I don't think they're any worse than men. Oh, and find about ten people with experience in raising cattle."

"Done. I can give you five hundred if you want," Zhang Xin readily agreed. Due to the ongoing immigration work, Lingao's reception capacity was stretched. A purification cycle was 40 days, and the quarantine camp in Lingao could only accommodate about four hundred people at a time. Many of the recruited immigrants had to be settled in Guangzhou to await transport. The Guangzhou station had set up a village-like quarantine zone in the suburbs for some preliminary "purification" work. There were already over a thousand people stranded in the camp. To avoid arousing the suspicion of the local officials, Guo Yi was already trying to find ways to send some of them away as soon as possible.

"I'm afraid I can't handle five hundred," Wen Tong said. "Let's start with three hundred. There are a thousand things to do here, and I was hoping to get more cadres from Lingao."

"Cadres are hard to come by," Zhang Xin said. "The Qiwei people are very reliable. You can select some key personnel from them to be military cadres." Seeing Wen Tong's stunned expression, Zhang Xin added, "Leizhou is a chaotic place. As a big sugar factory owner, you'll naturally attract the envy of all sorts of characters. Bandits are a given, but if the local gentry get ideas, that could also be a problem. You need to have an armed force to protect yourself and your property. Start by forming a militia. We'll send you some weapons from Lingao."

"Alright," Wen Tong said, thinking he would leave this matter to Chang Shide—he knew how to wield a ghost-head saber, after all.

"I plan to first establish a sugarcane cooperative here in Xuwen, and then expand to places like Haikang and Suixi."

"Will you continue to buy up sugarcane land to expand the plantations?"

"I hope to establish plantations," Wen Tong said. "The current business model here is still dominated by small-scale farming, and the cultivation and management levels are too backward."

During his half-month journey, Wen Tong had gotten a good grasp of the sugarcane cultivation situation. Under the small-scale farming system, the cultivation of cash crops was very haphazard: some grew fruit cane, others grew sugar cane. As for field management, some were clearly diligent, while others were careless, completely dependent on the weather. Some people were even growing sugarcane in places that were not suitable for it.

For a cash crop like sugarcane, the best business model was naturally large-scale plantations: consolidating these small plots of land into a large sugarcane plantation. Whether using wage labor or slavery, the production efficiency would be much higher than the current small-scale farming.

But acquiring the farmers' land was not easy. The cane farmers were rarely bankrupt or in financial difficulty. Even with the terrifyingly high interest rates, growing sugarcane was still profitable. Without natural disasters or man-made calamities, it was difficult to annex land on a large scale. Unless the transmigrators manipulated the price of sugar, forced all these small farmers into bankruptcy, and then bought them out one by one. Wen Tong did not agree with this plan, not because he was particularly benevolent, but because he didn't think the transmigrator group had the ability to do so yet.

"My idea is to create a sugarcane cooperative," Wen Tong presented his plan. "Organize all the farmers who grow the same crop, and under their leadership, provide unified technical guidance, use improved varieties, purchase fertilizer collectively, and process and sell the sugarcane uniformly. This will lower costs and increase profits." Wen Tong estimated that this plan would attract many small farmers.

"This plan probably won't yield many results in the first year, but over time, once the benefits become apparent, the farmers will naturally be willing to join. We can't force them since we're not the government. We have to rely on word-of-mouth and reputation to achieve our goal."

"Then you'll have to put down roots in Leizhou," Zhang Xin said, looking at his ambitious plan. "This plan won't see any benefits for three to five years. Just persuading each and every farmer, and then the profit sharing after the harvest... you'll need a good number of people to assist you."

"I don't mind putting down roots. I can enjoy the life of a great landlord," Wen Tong was very interested in his new venture. "I've applied to the Education Committee for some management and technical personnel from here. I'll take as many as they can give me. I'm also prepared to train my own people for the rest. As for persuading the small farmers to join, I'll persuade as many as I can. After three to five years, if all goes well, I'll be the largest sugar supplier in Leizhou. My sugar will be plentiful and of high quality. Then, I'll engage in some price dumping, crash the market's purchase price, and bankrupt all those who refuse to join the cooperative. Then I'll buy up both their land and their labor."

Zhang Xin nodded repeatedly, surprised that a technician like Wen Tong could come up with such a ruthless plan.

"Just ask for whatever you need. The Guangzhou station will fully cooperate."

"We're just a sugar production base here, we don't have any intelligence personnel, but I'm very interested in the specific situation in Haian Street. The locals call it 'Sweet Port,' and all the sugar is exported from there. There are also many sugar merchants on the street. These merchants from Chaozhou and Shantou will be our rivals sooner or later—"

"That's easy. We'll arrange for people to go undercover there. If normal methods don't work, we can always resort to some abnormal ones. The men from the Special Reconnaissance Team are itching for some action."

"Hehe, let's hope it doesn't come to that. But our time is limited, we can't get bogged down in a trade war. A quick and decisive approach is better."

The two sides agreed on a series of communication methods. Since Leizhou was not an official dispatch station, but only a secondary base, there was no radio assigned to them at present. Communication with Lingao would primarily use carrier pigeons. Communication with Guangzhou, in addition to carrier pigeons, could also use the Qiwei Escort Agency's routes to deliver letters. According to the Executive Committee's instructions, they were not to easily send people across the sea to Lingao for contact unless absolutely necessary—direct contact between the two sides should be as minimal as possible.

The Executive Committee also had a connection in Leizhou with the salt merchant Liu Gang, who lived in Haikang County. However, after consideration, the committee decided that the two sides should maintain separate lines of communication and avoid contact. Liu Gang was an important channel for them to smuggle salt into the mainland and needed to be protected.
