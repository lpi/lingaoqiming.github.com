Qian Shuixie waited until he saw the two military dogs in the team being carefully lowered into the small boat in their special harnesses before he saluted Li Ziping, put on his steel helmet, and climbed down the rope ladder. His personal orderly followed him down. Because Qian Shuixie had a wife, he didn't dare to openly have a female orderly. He had to go through the proper channels and choose a nimble sixteen-year-old boy who could do laundry and cook to be his orderly. This boy was originally a runaway slave from Guangdong. As the saying goes, "no one is more clever than a eunuch," and in this timeline, those who were servants were not lacking in cleverness. Qian Shuixie was well taken care of and had a good impression of him, so he gave him the name Chandler.

Chandler was a naturalized citizen with the status of an indentured servant, and he had no right to choose his own surname or name. Generally, they were named using their original surname plus a name given at the purification camp. If the roster showed that a certain surname was too common, their surname would be changed. However, once they gained the favor of an Elder and became an adopted child, apprentice, personal attendant, or orderly, they could be given the Elder's surname. This was a great honor for a naturalized citizen, and the General Office recognized this practice and issued corresponding certificates of bestowed surnames.

Although Chandler was an orderly, he was also a formal member of the special reconnaissance team, and his training results were not bad. He carried Qian Shuixie's large, fully packed field backpack and nimbly climbed down the rope ladder. Because the training intensity of the special reconnaissance team was very high and they were on 24-hour combat readiness, their food standard had always been high. Recently, it was adjusted to the same standard as the Elders. Not only was fish guaranteed at every meal, but even the most scarce oil and fat were also guaranteed every day. Therefore, their physical fitness was a big step above that of ordinary naturalized citizens.

"Is everyone here?"

"All present!" the NCO reported to him.

Qian Shuixie raised one hand high and then brought it down, three times in a row. "Move out!" he commanded loudly.

The sailors on the rowing boat immediately pulled the oars, and the boat slowly headed towards the shore.

A total of two rowing boats were lowered from the Haitian. One was loaded with the fifteen members of the landing survey team, and the other was for the marines. They carried a "typewriter" to serve as a fire point in the lagoon and could directly cover the landing team if necessary.

Li Ziping ordered all the cannons and "typewriters" on the ship to be on alert and to open fire to cover the landing detachment in case of an enemy attack.

They soon landed near the mouth of a larger freshwater river that flowed into the bay. Although the Haitian was not planning to establish a permanent camp here this time, the survey team and the special reconnaissance team were preparing to conduct two or three days of reconnaissance and survey activities in the vicinity, so a temporary camp had to be established where there was fresh water.

The coast was exceptionally desolate. The beach was empty, and there were no villages or houses along the coast. But from the traces of residue on the beach, he could see that people often came to the seaside and the lagoon. Obviously, the Pingpu people were not far from the sea. They did not live by the sea to prevent pirate attacks.

The marines began to set up a simple camp at the mouth of the river. Qian Shuixie led the team along the river into the inland. His primary task was to climb Takau Mountain and observe the surrounding environment from a high point, so that the survey team led by Liu Zheng could draw a rough topographical map of the area around Takau Port. This place would become a new base for the transmigrator group in the future. [Wu Nanhai][y009]'s Agricultural Committee had long coveted the Tainan Plain, which could be developed on a large scale.

Deep in the inland, apart from small patches of forest, there were deep grasslands and shrubs everywhere. It was now approaching summer, the time when the vegetation was most luxuriant. Not only was it difficult to walk, but there were also many mosquitoes and insects. As soon as one moved, a cloud of various mosquitoes and insects would be disturbed. Liu Zheng was a seasoned backpacker and knew how dangerous the insects in this kind of terrain were. Moreover, Taiwan had always been plagued by malaria, so all members of the landing survey team were tightly wrapped, wearing high-top canvas boots and wide-brimmed hats with mosquito nets.

Wearing this outfit was certainly inconvenient. Combined with the dense grass and forest, the survey team, which landed at noon, did not climb to the main peak of Takau Mountain until after four in the afternoon.

Although the scenery along the way was desolate, they still saw many traces of human activity. There were faintly discernible paths in the grasslands, traces of once-cultivated fields, and at the foot of Takau Mountain, they also found the ruins of a completely collapsed and buried aboriginal settlement. Obviously, people had once lived here, and in large numbers. Based on the scale of the settlement and the traces of fields they found, Liu Zheng believed that at least four or five hundred aborigines had once lived here.

Where did these aborigines go? It is generally believed that they were attacked and killed by the pirate Lin Daoqian during the Jiajing period, and the entire community migrated to the inland "Ahoulin." But the information provided by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Ren Fu's oral account both indicated that these aborigines should still be not far from the coast, rather than deep inland. Therefore, the immigrants who landed in Kaohsiung were bound to have conflicts with the local Pingpu people.

The altitude of Takau Mountain was over 300 meters. With their high-powered telescopes, it was enough to see the topography of the nearby ten square kilometers. What appeared before them was the vast Kaohsiung Plain. Although the inland plain in their field of vision was basically desolate grasslands and jungles, from time to time they could still see some simple villages and the surrounding cultivated paddy fields.

"There are quite a few natives here," Liu Zheng said with a frown. "It's best to clean them up all at once, otherwise it will be very troublesome if conflicts arise in the future..."

Qian Shuixie did not speak. The survey team was marking the discovered settlements on the map one by one. From the number and scale of the discovered settlements, the legendary "Takau" community had a population of at least two thousand. The Dutch recorded that they could mobilize four or five hundred armed personnel at a time.

Judging from the distribution of aboriginal communities in Taiwan at that time, the Takau community was a large community no less than the Xinkang community in Tainan. Historically, they had always been in conflict with the Xinkang community, and it was not until the Dutch intervened in the dispute that the Takau community was driven out of the Kaohsiung Plain.

"To drive the natives away from here, we need at least one infantry company, plus militia," Qian Shuixie estimated the required forces.

According to historical data, in the Christmas campaign launched by the Dutch in 1635, they defeated the Takau community and forced them to submit and move inland. They dispatched five hundred men plus five or six hundred allied troops from the Xinkang community. In primitive societies, all able-bodied men were soldiers, so it can be inferred that the community had at least one thousand able-bodied men. Otherwise, the Dutch would not have mobilized such a large force. The campaign against the Takau community was one of the few large-scale military operations conducted by the Dutch in Taiwan.

Liu Zheng said, "The landing of the advance team should begin in the winter after the end of the typhoon season."

It was now about to enter summer. In summer, not only were mosquitoes rampant, but there were also many typhoons, which greatly restricted the navigation of ships and the landing of personnel and materials. It could even cause epidemics. At the end of 1631, there were not yet a large number of immigrants from either Zhejiang or Shandong. At this time, to start a full-scale landing and construction in Kaohsiung, there was still time.

"And in winter, the vegetation withers, and the visibility is good, which is convenient for observation. Look at the density of the vegetation," Liu Zheng pointed to the hillside. "Those tribesmen can easily hide hundreds of people in there, and you might not even discover them when they are right in front of you..."

Qian Shuixie nodded. The winter in subtropical Taiwan was of course not cold, but it was now the Little Ice Age, and the temperature in southern Taiwan should be a few degrees lower than in the 21st century. Even in Hainan, which was at a lower latitude, some of the vegetation showed obvious signs of withering in winter. The Dutch chose to launch their campaign at Christmas, and this factor was obviously also taken into consideration.

As it was getting late, Qian Shuixie decided to camp on the mountain and set off for the inland the next morning.

The survey team found a spring near a few large rocks on the top of the mountain. There were large rocks here, the terrain was flat, and there was not much vegetation. There was also fresh water nearby. It was a good place to camp. The two of them discussed and decided to camp here for the night. Liu Zheng instructed his men to build a bonfire under a small clump of trees and sent people to sprinkle sulfur and lime around the camp to repel any possible snakes and insects.

Dinner was field rations. Although they had seen deer, wild boars, and other wild animals on the way up the mountain, Qian Shuixie did not allow them to hunt for the sake of caution and health. Even so, the hungry team members devoured the field rations like a whirlwind. Chandler made a decent dinner for Liu Zheng and Qian Shuixie with the Elder-exclusive field rations, and the two of them ate with relish.

"Your orderly is very capable," Liu Zheng praised.

"Yes, very capable. Unfortunately, he's just like us, haha," Qian Shuixie picked up a stick from the bonfire, lit a farm cigar, and puffed away. "No multiple uses."

Liu Zheng teased him, "I think this little Qian is quite good-looking."

"I'm not gay, and I'm not one of those sour scholars from the Ming Dynasty," Qian Shuixie chuckled a few times. "Speaking of which, with a wife like mine, I don't even dare to think about a maid. Even if my wife is in Guangzhou and we're living apart, I have to be honest..."

Of course, Qian Shuixie also had a maid in his name who was now on the Feiyun, but there was no way to develop that kind of relationship.

"Look at you, as if I don't have a wife," Liu Zheng said.

Qian Shuixie remembered that Liu Zheng did have a wife, and she was very good-looking. He heard that she used to be in the arts. At the annual meeting, Liu Shuixin even sang a few songs—she was a professionally trained singer.

Liu Zheng said, "I heard that the Zhiminglou in Lingao, run by the General Office, is about to open. How about we go for a sauna together when we get back?"

"Let's talk about it later. Right now, my wife is far away. If your wife doesn't object, we'll go."

"No problem," Liu Zheng said. "What's wrong with taking a bath and getting a massage?"
