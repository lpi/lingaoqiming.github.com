"I never thought it would be so difficult to get to Lingao. The farthest I've ever been is Jinan Prefecture and Tianjinwei. Apart from knowing that Lingao is in Qiongzhou Prefecture in the south, I have no idea about the route." This Wang Xinglong was very talkative, and with Lin Ming's deliberate guidance, he chattered on about his experiences along the way.

It turned out that Wang Xinglong had not walked all the way to Lingao by himself. He couldn't afford the travel expenses for such a long journey, and he didn't know which road to take to Lingao. He only knew that the Australians had many business partners in Jiangnan, and there were ships coming and going. So he followed a large number of refugees and took an empty grain ship returning south along the canal, all the way to Jiangnan. In Shanghai, he met the shopkeeper of the Haixing Firm, and then he got a free ride to Lingao.

"If I wanted to make a living, it would have been easy to stay in Jiangnan. But I've always heard that the Australians here have strange skills and that miscellaneous studies are flourishing. My heart itched, so I came to Lingao." Wang Xinglong said with great interest, "Only after I came did I realize how good this place is. It's a time of peace and prosperity!"

Lin Ming cursed inwardly: another one who has drunk the 髡贼 (kūn zéi - 髡 rebels)'s intoxicating soup! Seeing that Wang Xinglong had not shaved his head or changed his clothes and was still in Ming dynasty attire, he asked, "You haven't shaved your head?"

"My body, hair, and skin are from my parents." Wang Xinglong sighed. "Now that my family is broken and I am alone, I only have these memories left. I dare not change them casually."

"Brother Wang is a filial son," Lin Ming praised. Since he was unwilling to shave his head and change his clothes, it seemed he still had a sense of Chinese identity and could be won over. "This is the attire of our great China. How can it be changed so easily? Otherwise, we won't be able to face our ancestors after we die."

How could Wang Xinglong know the twists and turns in Lin Ming's mind? He was a scholar by birth, and although he was still young, this concept had been ingrained in him since childhood. Lin Ming's praise of him as a filial son made him nod in agreement.

"It's also thanks to Shopkeeper Qian's willingness to take me in and bring me to Lingao. If I had taken the Australians' refugee ship, I would have had to shave my head whether I wanted to or not," Wang Xinglong sighed.

"The rule of the Australians is indeed a time of peace and prosperity, but this insistence on shaving one's head and changing one's clothes always feels a bit inappropriate... alas, after all, they are from overseas..." Lin Ming said deliberately.

"The Australians didn't say you have to shave your head and change your clothes, but if you don't, you can't enter their schools. Fortunately, there are many books and newspapers on the market, and there are also libraries—it's just a pity that I can't receive the teachings of the great Australian sages in person," Wang Xinglong added with some regret.

The two of them talked as they walked, and soon they arrived at the East Gate Market police station. After completing the household registration procedures, on the way back, Wang Xinglong took him to a shop to buy bedding and toiletries.

"These are all considered an advance. You can pay them back after you get your wages," Wang Xinglong said.

Returning to the Haixing Firm, Wang Xinglong led him to the back: it was a small brick-paved courtyard, surrounded by two-story small buildings on all four sides. In the middle was a well, and next to the well was a large green stone. A girl in a green dress with her hair in two buns was facing away from them, her sleeves rolled up high, vigorously washing clothes. The wooden basin on the ground was full of clothes to be washed.

"This is my younger sister," Wang Xinglong introduced, then called out, "Jinchun!"

The young woman turned her head. Seeing her cousin with a strange man, she was not surprised. She wiped her hands, which were red from the well water, on her apron and curtsied.

Lin Ming hurriedly returned the courtesy, cursing Wang Xinglong in his heart for being so ignorant. They were not related, so how could he directly let his sister come out to greet a stranger? Didn't he know that men and women should not have physical contact? Could it be that he had taken a liking to him and wanted to marry his sister to him...

Looking closely at the sister, her appearance was not bad. It was clear she was a girl from a middle-class or higher family, but she was a bit too tired and had lost some of her shape. Her figure was a bit stocky, and her arms were bare... a good girl, wasted...

While he was lost in thought, he heard Wang Xinglong say, "My sister also works at the Haixing Firm, in charge of general affairs. She is also our colleague. If Brother Lin has any clothes to be washed, just give them to her."

"How can I..."

"Brother Lin, don't be so polite," Wang Jinchun said, not minding at all. "This is my job. The shopkeeper hired me to wash clothes and clean for everyone. If you don't let me wash for you, wouldn't I be a redundant person in the shop?"

Wang Xinglong said, "Jinchun, Brother Lin has just come from the ship and doesn't know the rules here very well. He'll get used to it after a few more days." He then led Lin Ming to a small room on the second floor.

"Brother Lin, you can stay in this room." Wang Xinglong helped him put down his bedding. "The male clerks of the shop all live in this courtyard. The shower is downstairs in the south building, and the washroom and toilet are also there, which is very convenient."

"There are also female clerks here?" Lin Ming saw that this room was almost identical to the room in the For the People Inn, even the furniture was the same.

In the Ming and Qing dynasties, large shops and firms never had female employees. The clerks could not bring their families, and even the shopkeeper had to go to his post alone. Hiring female clerks was a shocking thing.

"That's right, my sister is one of them. Besides her, there are three or four other female clerks," Wang Xinglong said with a smile. "Brother Lin, you've just arrived and don't know the Australian customs. Many women here have to work, and some even work in the Australian factories."

"Not just work, some are even officials." With a high-pitched female voice, Wang Jinchun had already pushed the door open and come in. In one hand, she held a tray with a teapot and teacups, and in the other, she carried a large rattan-cased bottle. "If my brother hadn't forbidden me from getting 'purified,' I would have become a cadre long ago..."

"Purification requires shaving one's head, that is absolutely not allowed," Wang Xinglong shook his head like a rattle drum. "What a disgrace, what a disgrace."

The sister, however, didn't mind at all and complained, "It was you, brother, who said how good the Australians were and insisted on coming to Lingao. After all the hardship to get here, you are unwilling to follow the local customs. Now I can only be a clerk here. Look at Mr. Liu who came to Lingao with us. He shaved his head the earliest, and now he's already a section chief..."

Wang Xinglong had a smile on his face and did not refute, only saying, "Are the clothes all washed? I'll help you hang them up later." He then took a towel from his pocket. "Look at you, you don't even dry your arms after washing clothes. When you get old, your arms will ache..." He then pulled Jinchun's arm and began to wipe it carefully.

Lin Ming cried out inwardly, "Indecent! Indecent!" But he saw that Wang Jinchun didn't mind at all and let him wipe her, her eyes smiling. Lin Ming felt that the two of them were being intimate and cursed in his heart, "Truly worse than an animal! No wonder he would join the 髡!" He immediately felt great contempt for the Wang siblings. But he dared not show it on his face and just turned his head away.

While he was feeling awkward, he heard Wang Jinchun say, "Brother Lin, this is tea. You can keep the tea set in your room. Hot water can be fetched from the kitchen. This is a thermos. If you have any clothes to be mended, just give them to me. It's all part of my duties."

Lin Ming said a few polite words and saw the two of them out. His luggage was still at the inn, so he was in no hurry to move it over. He then took a closer look at the room and the courtyard. Although the layout was small, it was very clean and tidy. But he roughly saw that there were more than ten rooms in this small courtyard. Excluding the toilet, washroom, and shower room on the first floor, even with one person per room, there were at least seven or eight "respectable" clerks here.

Wang Xinglong said there were also "four or five female clerks," plus there must be some clerks and apprentices who slept in the common room and did rough work. Wouldn't that be more than twenty people... This shop used too many people!

Full of doubts, Lin Ming first opened the bedding he had bought and made his bed. Then he poured a cup of tea and drank a few sips to calm himself down. He had now settled down, had a job, a place to live, and was not afraid of being "arrested as a vagrant." He could now sort out his thoughts properly.

From what he had seen and heard so far, the 髡贼 attached great importance to "purification," and the core of "purification" was "shaving one's head and changing one's clothes"—this was a necessary condition to eat directly under the 髡贼. Along the way, whether it was the 髡贼's government offices, *baojia* system, shops, or workshops... all the people from top to bottom were like this. Right, Wang Xinglong had said this was called "naturalized citizen." Hmph, "naturalized," "naturalized," are you barbarians worthy of it?! As for the ordinary people, it seemed they could do as they pleased. There were many naturalized citizens on the streets who had shaved their heads and changed their clothes, but there were also many common people who kept the Ming dynasty attire.

The grace of the great Ming for three hundred years still remained. Lin Ming thought, it seems that even in Lingao, the 髡贼's lair, there are still many people who are loyal to the great Ming. Even someone like Wang Xinglong, who had actively joined the 髡, was not in favor of shaving his head and changing his clothes. It seems there is still hope.

Lin Ming left the Haixing Firm, first went to the labor introduction office to complete the procedures, and then went to the For the People Inn. It was already late, so he rested at the inn for a night and had a comfortable sleep: the room and bedding here were clean and tidy, and most importantly, there were no fleas or bedbugs. This was one of the places where Centurion Lin admitted that the great Ming was far inferior to Lingao.

The next morning, Lin Ming checked out of the room, moved his luggage to the Haixing Firm, and started his work as a "clerk master."

Different from what he had thought, the work of this clerk master was quite busy. Every day, the errand boy would bring a large pile of notes from Shopkeeper Qian's accounting room, with only a few sentences on them. But Lin Ming had to write letters based on the content of these notes. The content of the letters was varied, but they were all business correspondence: some were inquiries and quotations, some were instructions to buy or sell, and some were about personnel changes, financial turnover... all kinds of things, very complex. Lin Ming was also an old hand at handling official documents, but he had never seen this kind of thing before. Fortunately, Wang Xinglong was there to guide him, and he soon roughly figured out the key points and his writing speed increased a lot.

After writing these letters, they were sealed in special envelopes, and the recipient's name and address were written on them—in addition to some places in Guangdong and Fujian, they were also sent to Nan-Zhili, Zhejiang, and even Tianjinwei and the capital. He didn't even know where some of the places were. After asking Wang Xinglong, he learned that they were all counties under the jurisdiction of Qiongzhou Prefecture.
