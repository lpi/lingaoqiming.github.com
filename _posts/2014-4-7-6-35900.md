The next day, the police station did indeed come to verify their information. The household registration forms had already been filled out, and as usual, a police officer checked and registered them one by one. Since they had no fixed address, they were registered under the inn's temporary household. Then, each person was issued a temporary identification card.

Zhuo Yifan and the others had hoped to see the fierce and fiery policewoman again, but she didn't come this time. Instead, a few charming and beautiful young policewomen arrived. However, after the previous incident, no one was foolish enough to cause trouble. Several of the occupied courtyards didn't even open their doors, and the idle people all hid inside.

Although the household registration forms were very detailed, these household registration officers still asked a great many questions, including where they came from, who in their family hadn't come, what they did for a living, and whether anyone in their family was an official or had a title... They asked about everything in great detail.

Although the numerous questions were annoying, their smiling faces held an undeniable authority. Li Xiaoliu had already come to warn them: when registering their households, they absolutely could not refuse to answer. Otherwise, they would not be able to register, get a temporary ID card, and would not be able to stay in Lingao.

Fortunately, they had learned about these procedures when they read the "Notes on Pacifying the 髡," and had already prepared their "cover story." Zhuo Yifan was confident that they had not revealed any flaws.

After registering their households and receiving their ID cards, the police officers left. Wan Lifeng respectfully saw them out and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief when he returned.

"That went smoothly!"

"Thanks to the 'Notes on Pacifying the 髡'!" Meng Bofei said with a serious expression. "The 髡's method of checking backgrounds is very thorough. If we hadn't been prepared, we would have definitely been exposed today."

Although they were deputies in the team, their experience in the martial arts world was far greater than Zhuo Yifan's. This process of registering households and obtaining documents, for ordinary people, would not be a big deal—at most, it would be tedious. But for this cobbled-together team, it was a very effective move.

If just one or two people's stories didn't match the others, they would be immediately exposed.

Zhuo Yifan, however, had no time for reflection. He had to go out immediately and send the "safe arrival" signal to contact Sima Qiudao.

Sending the signal was easy: he just had to place a stone on the wall of the public toilet in the alley where the inn was located.

Before he received a response to his signal, Li Xiaoliu had already come to invite him to a "briefing."

The clients of the "Qiong'an Inn" were almost all wealthy landowners who had come to Lingao to "escape the turmoil." Some had fled their hometowns due to disasters, selling their land and houses. Others, seeing that the Ming Dynasty was on the verge of collapse and that there were signs of chaos, had sent a few of their sons and nephews to Lingao to buy property and prepare a retreat for their families, a classic "three burrows for a crafty rabbit" strategy.

Whatever their motives, these people all carried large amounts of capital and intended to purchase property and settle down in Lingao. Lingao was a peaceful place, but its social management model was completely modern. Not to mention the local tyrants from small towns, even the landlords from the capital and Jiangnan might not be able to adapt to the local rules and customs.

To prevent his clients from being flogged or sent to dig sand shortly after arriving in Lingao, Li Xiaopeng had specially prepared an "Immigration and Naturalization Briefing" for new clients.

This briefing was organized by the inn. The process was to invite a naturalized citizen cadre from the Lingao County office to first introduce the basic laws and policies of Lingao. For this, Li Xiaopeng had even paid out of his own pocket to print pamphlets for the clients. This was followed by a presentation on related investment opportunities.

As the "young master," Zhuo Yifan could not refuse—he had come to Lingao under the pretext of buying a house and moving.

The briefing was held in the inn's garden. To satisfy the clients' "Ming-style lifestyle" needs, the "Qiong'an Inn" had specially set up a courtyard in the garden with a flower hall and a small stage, for the wealthy to feast, watch plays, and relieve their loneliness and boredom.

Many people were already seated in the flower hall. These were all the wealthy families who had recently arrived in Lingao. There were elderly men with white beards, handsome young men, and middle-aged men who were already starting to get fat. They were all dressed in silk and satin, but their faces were all filled with anxiety. Although everyone said that Lingao was a paradise on earth, this place was no longer under the rule of the Ming. From the moment they entered Qiongzhou, the inn's attendants who had come to welcome them had repeatedly reminded them: the rules here are different from the Ming, and you must not act arrogantly.

Many families had brought their entire households with them. Even those who had only sent their sons and nephews had brought a large amount of property. A single mistake in this strange land could be a disaster for a family.

The only local person they could trust at the moment was the owner of the "Qiong'an Inn." Therefore, they attached great importance to this "briefing." Not only had the masters, old and young, come, but a bamboo curtain had also been hung at the back—clearly, many of the women had also come.

The briefing had not yet begun, and the flower hall was filled with a low hum of conversation.

Zhuo Yifan, accompanied by his pageboy, was led by Li Xiaoliu to an empty table. Tea and four kinds of fruit pastries had already been placed on the table.

Li Xiaoliu whispered, "Master Zhuo, please have a seat. This is the 'Immigration and Naturalization Guide.' The key points of the briefing are all in here. You can listen and read at the same time, which will make it easier to understand."

After speaking, Xiaoliu refilled his teacup and carefully withdrew.

After a while, Li Xiaopeng led in a "fake 髡" with short hair, wearing a gray four-pocketed jacket. Zhuo Yifan knew that this was probably a so-called "cadre." He had heard from Shi Weng that these "fake 髡" were all riff-raff from the Great Ming who couldn't support themselves and wouldn't die, so they had all joined the 髡 and become their accomplices, their most capable agents. Many loyal subjects of the court had fallen at their hands.

Zhuo Yifan wanted to see what this "capable agent" looked like. He looked intently and saw only an ordinary young man, no more than thirty years old, with ordinary features and a dark complexion. He had short hair like a monk and a clean-shaven face. He wore a gray cotton jacket with patches on the elbows—he looked quite poor, but his clothes were clean and tidy, and he had an air of neatness about him. He carried a plain canvas satchel slung over his shoulder.

Li Xiaopeng said a few opening words, nothing more than polite pleasantries, and then introduced the man as a "clerk from the Civil Affairs Section of the Lingao County Office of the Civil Affairs Committee."

Zhuo Yifan didn't know what kind of official this title was, but he thought it was probably something like a clerk—and he secretly looked down on him.

He saw the man stand in front of the central table, take off his satchel and place it on the table, and then scan the flower hall with a calm and composed gaze, completely unlike the either obsequious or sinister expressions he had seen on the faces of Ming officials.

He secretly praised in his heart: The 髡 really have talented people!

The "fake 髡" didn't bother with pleasantries and began to explain the local policies and regulations in a few words.

Zhuo Yifan had originally thought he was just here to make an appearance, but now he put away his contempt and listened carefully.

The briefing was divided into several parts. The first part concerned the laws and regulations related to daily life, such as the "Hygiene Regulations," the "Urban Appearance Regulations," and the "Public Security Law"... These were things that people would encounter in their daily lives, and a slight carelessness could lead to a violation. For people who had come from the Ming and had not yet had time to change their old habits, "breaking the law" was a matter of minutes—they might even break the law as soon as they stepped onto the street.

For these wealthy families, some of the regulations were not very relevant, such as spitting and urinating in public. They had servants carrying spittoons when they went out, and they knew to be discreet about urinating and defecating, and would never do so in the street as long as there was a toilet available. But the various "privileges" in social life that the gentry and wealthy families were accustomed to were absolutely forbidden under the rule of the Senate.

In other words, the government could no longer be ordered around by the gentry and wealthy families with a single note, nor would you be considered the "foundation of the state" just because you were a grain-paying household or had a title, and be given "some face" in all matters, enjoying various legal exemptions and preferential treatment.

The phrase "everyone is equal before the law" was deafening, and it made the wealthy families, who were used to privileges, feel anxious. What? Would they have to be on an equal footing with the unruly commoners in the future? Those unruly commoners, who would still resist rent and cause trouble in the market even with the threat of the yamen's paddle and cangue, if they were truly "equal," could they still live their lives?

Some of the wealthy families in the audience began to have second thoughts. Those who had already brought their entire families began to regret their rashness.

"The so-called equality before the law does not mean that favoring the poor is equality. It means handling matters impartially based on facts and in accordance with the law! Under the rule of our Senate, we will not favor or protect anyone because of their wealth, gender, place of origin, or any other reason. I think everyone knows that some officials in the Ming pride themselves on being honest and upright: in a lawsuit between a rich man and a poor man, they favor the poor man; in a lawsuit between a rich man and a scholar, they favor the scholar... Here, there is no such thing!" he said, chopping his hand down. "Whoever is right and legal, we will protect them. Whoever is wrong and breaks the law, the law will never let them go!"

Zhuo Yifan sneered inwardly: To be able to say such empty and beautiful words, the 髡 are truly shameless. Not to mention whether they would favor the poor, just this "everyone is equal," every dynasty has had the saying "if the prince breaks the law, he is punished the same as the common people," but who has ever taken it seriously? You know, "punishment does not extend to the great officials" was also said by a sage.

As expected, the faces of the wealthy families around him showed expressions of disbelief.

The cadre seemed to know what they were thinking and said again, "I know you won't believe it right away. But you will be in Lingao for a long time, so you can experience for yourselves whether what I have said today is true or false."
