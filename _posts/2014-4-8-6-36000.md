Next, the cadre began to explain the parts of the civil law that were more relevant to the wealthy families.

The most important issue was that of servants. Almost without exception, the wealthy families had brought a large number of servants with them. The practice of keeping servants was already very common in the Ming Dynasty—a Juren would have more than twenty servants accompanying him when he traveled. In the late Ming, with frequent wars and famines, the cost of keeping servants was extremely low.

The Senate did not welcome private ownership of slaves. In particular, the vast majority of servants in feudal Chinese society were used for domestic service, producing nothing but consuming social wealth. Moreover, the ownership of slaves allowed the wealthy to directly control a large population, which was unbearable for the Senate.

Therefore, the Senate restricted the ownership of slaves at the legal level. Not only was the slave trade completely prohibited, but there were also various restrictions on existing servants. Anyone who kept servants under the rule of the Senate had to pay a one-time "servant registration fee" to continue to keep them, and then an annual "servant use tax" per head.

This immediately caused a buzz of discussion below. What kind of law was this? You had to pay taxes to the government for the servants you bought? And you had to pay it every year!

Wait, that wasn't all. According to the Senate's law, there was a quota for the number of servants each household could keep. If a household "exceeded the quota," the servant use tax would be levied on a progressive basis. That is, the more servants you kept, the higher the tax rate.

This policy was not only to reduce the number of servants, but also one of the legal means to force large families to divide their households. To pay less tax, the large families of several generations living together would inevitably consider dividing their households to increase their servant quota and avoid taxes.

Seeing the resentful expressions on the faces of the people around him, Zhuo Yifan secretly nodded. Although he himself came from a family of officials and had servants at home, he did not approve of the exploitation and enslavement of a large number of servants.

Although the 髡's move did not explicitly prohibit the ownership of slaves, it actually greatly increased the burden of keeping them, thus restricting it in a disguised way. It could be called a benevolent policy—it was just that this benevolent policy was a bit too commercial. He felt both admiration and contempt in his heart.

The cadre then went on to explain many other important points about living in Lingao. The whole presentation lasted about half an hour. Although it was not long, it was very thorough and clear. After he finished speaking, Zhuo Yifan saw him say a few more words to Li Xiaopeng, then take a piece of paper from his briefcase and hand it to him. Li Xiaopeng stamped it, tore off half, and returned it to him. The cadre then left.

Zhuo Yifan was secretly puzzled. If it was a "bribe," he would understand. But what was this business of stamping and tearing paper?

It turned out that this "policy briefing" was not free. It was not within the scope of the Civil Affairs Section's work to give legal lessons to the rich. The Senate's immigration policy was to "open the door." People from the Great Ming were welcome to come, and no particular group was given special treatment. Therefore, a fee was charged as a matter of course. The fee was naturally paid by the Qiong'an Inn. Li Xiaopeng's stamp on the slip was the proof of payment.

Next, it was Li Xiaopeng's turn to speak. He talked about what the rich cared about most: buying houses and land.

Buying a house was a given. Whether they were immigrating with their whole family or preparing a "rabbit's three burrows," they needed a permanent place to live. In order to continue their traditional lifestyle of luxury and to satisfy the "Australian-style life" that their wives, young masters, and young ladies envied, they had to acquire land and property.

However, Li Xiaopeng's words once again poured cold water on them. The land policy in Lingao was very complicated and different from that of the Great Ming. In the Great Ming, as long as the landowner agreed to sell, it didn't matter what the land was used for before. Once you bought it, you could basically do whatever you wanted with it: build a house, a workshop, raise pigs, grow vegetables, or use it as a cemetery. Generally, no one would interfere, let alone the urban management or city appearance departments. The remnants of this laissez-faire system persisted until 1949. At that time, in the grand city of Beijing, there were still all kinds of animal pens and poultry sheds in residential areas, with pigs, sheep, cattle, chickens, ducks, and geese. Pigs and sheep were slaughtered openly on the city streets. As for having cemeteries in the city, that was not even worth mentioning in any city at the time.

In Lingao, however, land was divided into various uses. According to the land planning practices of another time and space, the entire county's land was divided into residential, industrial, cultural and educational, and agricultural uses. To run to a place, see that the feng shui was good, and buy it for a cemetery, or to see that the scenery was beautiful and buy it to build a villa—under the rule of the Senate, if you wanted to build your own house, you could only buy residential land. It was simply impossible for private individuals to buy land for a cemetery and build a family tomb.

Unfortunately, residential land in Lingao was particularly scarce. On the one hand, there was the demand from the expansion of industry and agriculture. On the other hand, the influx of a large number of immigrants exacerbated this shortage. In order to provide more housing for immigrants and alleviate the housing shortage, the Executive Committee was strict in its approval of private residential land purchases, in order to reserve enough residential land for the construction of apartment buildings and dormitories for sale and rent.

Of course, those who wanted to buy land could also buy residential land from private individuals. However, there were very few natives who owned private residential land. After all, the entire population of Lingao was originally less than 40,000. The residential land they owned was only a very small part compared to the Senate, which had seized all the official and barren land in the county.

The housing shortage in Lingao not only resulted in extremely high prices for residential land at present, but also the county's only construction unit, the Lingao General Construction Company, was fully booked. It was basically impossible to buy land and build your own house in Lingao.

It was precisely for this reason that Li Sunqian's real estate business was so prosperous. It could be said that his real estate company was the only one in the county that could provide housing that met the needs of these wealthy families and guarantee delivery within a year.

The housing problem was relatively easy to solve, as Li's real estate company was there to handle it. It was just a matter of how much money to spend. But "acquiring property" was far more difficult than "buying a house."

According to the thinking of the rich, buying land and collecting rent was naturally the most stable method. In ancient Chinese society, land was always the property with the strongest ability to preserve its value. It did not require complex knowledge or much effort, and the income was quite stable. In times of war, you could hide the land deeds and flee. As long as peace was restored, you could take out the land deeds, and no matter whether the dynasty had changed or not, the government would recognize them. It didn't matter if the tenants were all dead; you could just recruit new ones.

Therefore, not only did rural landlords think this way, but also merchants who had made their fortunes in industry and commerce, and court officials. After getting money, they would buy large amounts of land and collect rent. Even the Zheng family, the maritime commercial hegemon, also purchased a large amount of land and became the largest landlord in Fujian.

When the rich came to Lingao, they naturally had the same idea. However, at this briefing, they quickly discovered that this path was blocked.

The Senate did not legally prohibit the tenancy system, so the old tenancy system could still operate according to the old customs. However, from a legal and economic perspective, the Senate had issued several legal documents that imposed many restrictions and suppressed the tenancy system.

After the tax reform, the landlords' usual practices of concealing land to evade taxes and shifting the tax burden were no longer feasible. The strictly enforced progressive agricultural tax made the burden on tenant landlords very heavy. What they found most difficult to bear was the Senate's siphoning off of the labor force. State-owned and private intensive farms, and the booming industrial and commercial enterprises, all caused the original tenants to move elsewhere.

Many immigrants entered Lingao, but the right to allocate them was entirely in the hands of the Australians. Free immigrants had too many employment options and were not willing to be the tenants of landlords.

The result was that tenant landlords found it difficult to retain tenants on their land, and the turnover rate of tenants was high. No matter how much land a landlord had, it was useless if no one cultivated it. To retain tenants, they had to offer better share-cropping ratios and tenancy conditions. Land income plummeted—the Tiandihui had now begun to consciously refuse to provide agricultural services to tenant landlords, and they were completely unable to enjoy the benefits of agricultural technological progress.

In the end, the local landlords either sold their land to engage in industry and commerce, or they invited the Tiandihui, the largest "tenant" in Lingao, to manage their land. Very few landlords who continued to maintain the tenancy system remained. This was especially true for small and medium-sized landlords, almost none of whom were spared.

It was not too difficult for the new rich to buy land locally. Although there was little developed and cultivated land, there was plenty of "barren land to be developed for agriculture." The difficulty was how to manage it. It was obviously not feasible to solve everything by recruiting a few tenant families.

Therefore, Li Xiaopeng proposed a package of investment solutions.

For those who were not seeking high returns and did not want to use their brains, they could buy land or "barren land to be developed for agriculture," and then directly ask the Tiandihui for a full or partial package...

"May I ask, Master Li, what is a full package, and what is a partial package?" someone asked when Li Xiaopeng got to this point. The rich were very concerned about acquiring property—this was related to their future survival and development in Lingao.

Li Xiaopeng explained that a full package meant entrusting the land entirely to the Tiandihui for management. The landlord did not have to do anything. They would just collect their share according to the lease. They didn't even have to invest a single penny; even the taxes were paid by the Tiandihui on their behalf. But in this case, the landlord's income was quite small.

In the full package management, the Tiandihui would first charge a service fee. Then, the costs of developing barren land, improving the soil and water, buying seeds and fertilizers, hiring long-term laborers and agricultural machinery... all the expenses incurred in managing the land, up to the final tax payment, would be deducted from the land's harvest in advance. The remaining net income would then be shared with the landlord. The landlord could generally get about 30% of the net income.

If the land was relatively barren or simply wasteland, the initial investment would be very large, and the landlord might not get any share at all in the first few years.
