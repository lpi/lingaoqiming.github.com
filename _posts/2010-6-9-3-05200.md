"It's all here." Xiao Gui took a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it over. It was a detailed list of the delivered goods. Chang Shide glanced at it. The allocated materials were truly impressive, ranging from boilers, steam engines, cement, and bricks to thermometers, pH test strips, and laboratory equipment... Many things he hadn't thought to apply for were also on the list—they had been much more thorough than he was.

"This ship must be newly built. It's quite suitable for transporting such large items. I was originally worried about how the steam engine and boiler would be transported."

"Hehe, this is President Wen's latest design," Xiao Gui laughed. "It's called a... near-shore, shallow-draft, wide-body, flat-deck barge. President Wen originally planned to build all-wood containers, making this a sort of makeshift container ship. But after calculating, he realized that making containers out of wood was completely unrealistic—they were both heavy and not sturdy. The containers never materialized, but the ship was already under construction, so they just finished it."

"Aren't there a lot of containers piled up in Lingao?"

"Commissar Ma treats them like treasures. He wouldn't even let the metallurgy department dismantle them to be melted down for steel. He even specifically instructed that they be rust-proofed," Xiao Gui said.

As they were talking, Wen Xiu came in to report that the laborers had been organized. Because the cargo this time included a steam engine and a boiler, the demand for labor was huge. Therefore, all the able-bodied men from the entire South China Plantation had been mobilized, and they had also hired more than two hundred people from the surrounding area. A huge team of laborers was formed, equipped with countless carrying poles, ropes, and rolling logs. Wen Tong was most concerned about the boiler and the steam engine; the main structures of these two pieces of equipment had to be moved as a whole.

"Let's start unloading."

A group of workers in blue short clothes, short hair, and rattan hats disembarked from the ship. Their strange attire caused a stir among the onlookers. These men, carrying green bags, unloaded iron pipes, iron plates, and sacks of iron parts from the ship. They quickly assembled a platform on the stone embankment, then continued to connect the iron pipes on the platform, installing pulleys and chains. Under their command, the laborers came up. Some lined up to pull the chains, while others grabbed the ropes on the large cargo. One person climbed onto the platform, holding small red and green flags. Then, hundreds of laborers and workers began to pull the chains and ropes to the rhythmic sound of a whistle and the waving of the small flags. The behemoth on the deck was lifted up, trembling. A group of laborers, under the command of a chanter, turned the crane, and the cargo, following the movement of the crane arm, was slowly moved from the air to the pier and then slowly lowered onto the prepared rolling logs. The crowd of onlookers let out a gasp of amazement.

Transporting the sugar factory's equipment to the South China Sugar Factory was a very challenging task. Haian Port was only about ten kilometers from the South China Sugar Factory's location at Nanmentang, outside Xuwen County town. But the road was rough and winding, and the surface was uneven, barely passable for ox carts. Ordinary machinery and materials were either carried on shoulders or backs, or transported by ox cart. Large equipment could only be slowly pushed forward on rolling logs. The hardship was imaginable. To facilitate passage, a team of laborers was sent ahead to clear the road, level the ground, and fill in the potholes. The laborers took a full four days to transport the large equipment the ten-plus kilometers to the sugar factory. The people who came with the ship also quietly arrived at the sugar factory and settled into the courtyard prepared for them.

The horizontal steam engine transported this time was a Mozi II model. Although its horsepower had not increased, it was more efficient in steam utilization than the Mozi I. The Industrial Committee was quite satisfied with the performance of the Mozi II and had decided to put it into mass production. The one sent to Leizhou was the first mass-produced unit.

In addition to this equipment, the most unusual items were many long, narrow boxes. The three-person work team was eager to check them as soon as they arrived. The boxes were all marked with "Fragile" and "Handle with Care." They were all carried by hand and shoulder, not by ox cart. Opening the boxes, they were tightly packed with straw ropes and dry seaweed. Layer by layer, they were opened, and Wen Tong and Chang Shide were full of praise for the industrial department of Lingao.

Inside the boxes were glass and ceramic pipes of various calibers. These pipes would be used in areas with special requirements, to replace the more easily rusted cast iron pipes.

"This is too powerful—" Wen Tong was almost speechless.

"It's nothing, practice makes perfect. Besides, these pipes weren't just made for you. The chemical factory needs them in more places. This batch can only be considered trial production."

The future power workshop of the sugar factory was located by the river for convenient access to water. In addition to large-scale leveling of the foundation for equipment installation, Mei Lin also organized the construction of a reservoir specifically for treating the boiler water. Masons were recruited to build a towering chimney, something they had never built before. It was so large that all the local masons were not enough. Chang Shide also bought up all the bricks and tiles from the local brick kiln in one go. Now, the only brick kiln in the county was working overtime to produce bricks and tiles to supply the construction site's needs.

The three-roller press that Wen Tong had specifically requested arrived smoothly. With the help of the vast database, designing and manufacturing this machine didn't take much effort. The machinery factory only had some complaints about the large amount of steel consumed by the rollers. Wen Tong looked at it; the machine didn't look any worse than the old equipment he had seen.

"But the strength of many of the parts inside is questionable, so the service life is hard to say," Xiao Gui said. Some key connecting parts, gears, and transmission parts, although they were made, had poor durability due to material performance limitations.

"It doesn't matter, we brought a lot of spare parts this time," Chen Tianxiong said nonchalantly. "If it breaks, we'll just replace it. It's the first time we've made something like this, so it's inevitable that the quality is a bit poor."

In addition to the press, there were also a rotary knife and a crusher specifically for breaking and tearing the sugarcane. Sugarcane processed by crushing had a much higher juice extraction rate than the traditional method of directly feeding the sugarcane into the press.

A month later, the construction of the sugar factory's workshop and the installation of the equipment were finally completed. The boiler was successfully ignited once, and the steam engine started running. For the first time, the sky above Xuwen was filled with the billowing black smoke that symbolized modern industry. This semi-mechanized sugar factory, unique in this time and space, finally began mass production. Its daily sugarcane pressing capacity was 70 tons, with workshops for cane cutting, pressing, and sugar boiling. Except for the sugar boiling workshop, which continued to use the old manual operation method, all other workshops used machinery. The sugar boiling workshop used no fire at all, but directly used the steam from the boiler for heating.

The towering chimney of the South China Factory and its steel sugarcane press amazed many locals. When they heard that the factory continued to process sugarcane on behalf of others, many cane farmers came from afar to have their sugarcane processed, just to see for themselves how this newfangled sugar factory operated. Bundles of sugarcane were transported by ox cart to the sugar factory at the south gate of Xuwen County town. They first underwent mechanical processing: the sugarcane was first leveled and cut by a cane knife, then torn apart by a crusher. The crusher was very sophisticated because the sugar in the sugarcane was stored in the "pith." The crusher only broke the sugarcane along the direction of the fibers to avoid breaking the "pith" during the crushing process and causing the loss of sugarcane juice.

After being crushed, the sugarcane was transported in baskets by hand to the feeding port of the press. A three-roller press could extract 70% of the juice in one go, whereas modern sugar factories used several three-roller or multi-roller machines for continuous pressing, sometimes up to fifteen rollers to complete the process, with a juice extraction rate of up to 90%.

The transmigrators did not have such mechanical conditions, so they adopted a repeated pressing method. After the first pressing, the bagasse was not discarded but piled aside. After all the raw cane was pressed, it was passed through the press again. Although it was labor-intensive, the benefits were considerable.

The sugarcane juice extracted by the press was first sent to an iron heater, where it was heated by high-temperature steam as it flowed. Then it passed through a cement liming tank, where lime was added for clarification. Finally, it was transported through ceramic and glass pipes to a settling tank, where the impurities settled. The clarified sugarcane juice entered a boiling pot to be heated with steam to produce sugar. The method of removing molasses still used the earthenware funnel technique, but the scale was much larger, with over thirty funnels lined up in the sugar boiling workshop.

With the support of thermometers, pH test strips, and other experimental equipment from Lingao, Wen Tong, after much practice and repeated experiments, finally mastered the temperature at each stage of sugar boiling, the amount of lime to add, and a series of other data, and formulated a corresponding production process. The sugar masters were initially dismissive of his methods—they had followed their masters for many years and had mastered this technique through long-term practical experience, and even then, their mastery was only average. So they were skeptical of this new contraption and were even ready to see the owner make a fool of himself.

But the owner, relying on glass tubes, paper strips, and some indescribable jars and pots, not only produced sugar but also did so without any mistakes in every pot, and the sugar yield was almost the same every time! This was a devastating blow to the sugar masters' confidence—even the most skilled sugar masters in the county and the prefecture couldn't do this!

Seeing the fearful and adoring eyes of the sugar masters, Wen Tong was both proud and a little disappointed: why has our science and technology always been empirical? Why did no one ever think to explore its principles and establish standards?

The implementation of this method greatly reduced the waste in the sugar boiling process. And Wen Tong used this to establish a stricter assessment system for loss rate control—since the production factors were all controllable, the only factor that could cause excessive loss was the workers' lack of responsibility. From that day on, the people who were formerly called "masters" in the sugar boiling workshop became "workers."

This whole set of procedures was countless times more efficient and convenient than the traditional earthen sugar mills. The scene of large-scale, semi-mechanized production of sugarcane sugar left the local gentry and commoners alike dumbfounded.

The surprise was secondary. When the cane farmers discovered that after having their sugarcane processed by this factory, the amount of sugar produced was a quarter more than that of ordinary earthen mills, and the factory still maintained its low processing fee of thirty percent, the entire population of Xuwen's cane farmers went into a frenzy. Regardless of the distance, ox carts and boats came from all over to have their sugarcane processed, forming long queues at the factory gate. Some cane farmers had to wait for two or three days for their turn, but their enthusiasm did not wane. In the end, even entire boatloads of sugarcane were transported from Haikang, landed at Haian, and then hired ox carts to be transported to the South China Factory for processing. Due to the overwhelming number of people, there was some chaos. Liao Dahua had to once again ask the yamen to send people to maintain order and control the scene. The chimney, spewing black smoke, and the steel rollers, which roared as they devoured huge amounts of sugarcane, clearly left a deep impression on the assistant magistrate. However, his fear of the machinery far outweighed his curiosity, and he always kept a safe distance.

When Wen Tong got the numbers for the first day, he knew that the profit far exceeded his expectations. Especially in the processing-for-others business, a considerable part of the extra sugarcane juice extracted fell into the pockets of the South China Sugar Factory. This part of the profit was obtained at zero cost. Not to mention that the extra molasses and bagasse were also their benefits. The cane farmers did not need these by-products, but the South China Sugar Factory had a use for them.

If the equipment were better, with a twelve-roller machine and the water immersion method, a 97% extraction rate would not be a dream. Wen Tong thought that there was still a lot of profit potential to be tapped here.

Wen Tong even began to consider whether it was still necessary to maintain the other four earthen sugar mills. It seemed that driven by profit, the common people were not afraid of the distance and difficulty of the road. At least the earthen sugar mill in Xuwen could be closed down, leaving only the one in Haikang.

Mei Lin and the others who came to assist were also beaming with joy. Seeing the sugar factory flourishing, everyone was genuinely happy—this was another growth point for foreign trade. Of course, there were some problems during the operation of the whole set of equipment. Once, a pipe at the boiler interface broke and leaked, and several times, the gears and connecting parts of the press were damaged, which once affected production. But under the emergency repairs of Chen Tianxiong and Xiao Gui, it quickly returned to normal. Xiao Gui also had another task: to train several qualified boiler workers for the sugar factory—firing a boiler was a serious job. A moment of carelessness could harm oneself and others, not to mention that this boiler was a knock-off product.

Chen Tianxiong was not in a hurry. Although he also had the task of training maintenance technicians, his was a long-term business trip, and he would not be going back for a while. He had enough time to train apprentices. Wen Tong suggested that after the sugar factory's children's school was opened, they could select apprentices from among the older children of thirteen or fourteen based on their learning situation.

However, Chen Tianxiong's actions attracted Chang Shide's attention. In addition to his regular three daily inspections of the machinery, he often talked with the people from the Special Reconnaissance Team in the courtyard. Sometimes he would even change into local clothes and go out with the Qiwei escorts as guides. Obviously, Chen Tianxiong was not just here to maintain the machinery; he was most likely an intelligence officer.
