The news of the occupation of Jeongui, along with Nangong Wudi's report, reached Feng Zongze, who was holding the fort at the beachhead position on Seongsan. Although a full occupation of Jeju Island would inevitably mean shouldering the burden of supplying food to the forty to fifty thousand local inhabitants, Feng Zongze believed it was still worthwhile.

Because exiles and government slaves were mostly concentrated in specific areas, the population distribution on Jeju Island was highly centralized. Sixty to seventy percent of the population was located in the three towns and the nine coastal forts. This made it easy to achieve the objectives of occupation, control, and utilization. The three towns and nine forts also had a large number of official buildings available. Although Jeongui, in terms of its appearance and economic level, was just a large, walled village, it had all the necessary official buildings: a garrison headquarters, a training ground, barracks, a county school, government granaries... Though the standards were not high, they were all vacant buildings that could be utilized, saving a considerable amount of materials and labor for construction.

The refugees from Shandong would not be able to perform heavy physical labor at first, and they would also have to overcome the problem of acclimatization. Feng Zongze believed that at least in the initial phase of Operation Engine, they would have to rely heavily on local labor and facilities.

From this perspective, feeding these tens of thousands of people was not a losing proposition. What the Senate lacked most at the moment was population, and the Koreans were also a resource that could be fully utilized.

Since the Senate was prepared to assimilate and utilize even the people of northern Tonkin, a "Little China" like Korea was an even more suitable target. Furthermore, if a situation arose where the population of Jeju became too large and the food supply could not keep up, they could use the empty tonnage of the returning refugee and supply fleets to transport some people to Kaohsiung to participate in its development—their condition would be much better than that of the refugees from Shandong.

This would also change the island's demographic structure—once and for all. As he thought of this, a self-satisfied smile appeared on his face.

Feng Zongze stared at the map in his tent, marking and drawing on the glass plate with colored pencils. Currently, the military cleanup was proceeding smoothly. The task force had already occupied Jeongui County town and the two forts of Suji and Seogwi near Seongsan, capturing several hundred Joseon soldiers. On the southern front of Jeju Island, apart from Daejeong, which had not yet been occupied, the Joseon forces had been basically eliminated.

Judging from the consolidated reports from the various detachments, the Joseon military strength on the island was very weak. They not only lacked the ability to resist the invasion but couldn't even manage to harass them. During the attacks on the Suji and Seogwi forts, there were no conflicts that could be called battles. Basically, after the troops opened fire and shot down a few soldiers, the entire enemy force scattered.

From the situation in cleaning up the Suji and Seogwi forts, it was clear that the "nine forts"—the garrison posts—set up by the Joseon on the island were poorly armed, and the number of soldiers was far below strength. According to the testimony of captured Joseon soldiers, the actual number of soldiers in the garrison posts was less than half the official quota.

Each "fort" had several hundred government slaves who cultivated the official lands allocated to the post by the Joseon government. The original intention was to use this to support the soldiers, but like the *weisuo* system of the Ming Dynasty, it had long since fallen into decay. The produce from the land mostly ended up in the pockets of the local fort commanders and officials.

Jeju Island was not a fertile land, and its agricultural production was backward. For the fort commanders and officials, the fewer people who shared the produce from the land, the better. Thus, they were not concerned about filling the vacancies in their ranks.

This added weight to Feng Zongze's determination to take Jeju quickly.

That being said, the forces at his disposal were stretched thin. The total landing population was only a little over a thousand. Spreading them out to garrison three locations would be too dispersed. Of course, based on the intelligence provided by the Grand Library and the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, and the estimates made by the General Staff, neither the Joseon nor the Ming would launch an attack on the island. So, the external threat was basically non-existent. However, maintaining internal security on the island still required a considerable number of troops.

The Joseon government and army had always been ineffective during foreign invasions. It was the "righteous armies" mobilized by the lower-gentry and common people that had shown greater combat effectiveness. Therefore, at the forward committee meeting of the Jeju Island Task Force, the three Senators unanimously agreed that the military operations on Jeju should prioritize "pacification."

Swiftly capturing the government's centers of power on the island and controlling the officials, scholar-gentry, and landlords—if any—should serve to nip any future resistance in the bud.

Secondly, they needed to quickly form a local "puppet army"—no, that term wasn't good. Feng Zongze thought that it demeaned them and, in fact, acknowledged the legitimacy of the Joseon's rule over the area.

He needed a more appropriate name. After some thought, he decided to call it the "Public Security Army." The Public Security Army was already an irregular force composed of mercenaries. Since they could hire Japanese as public security soldiers, hiring Koreans was the same thing.

A local auxiliary force was crucial for strengthening their rule. After the Manchu Qing entered China, they made the formation of the Green Standard Army a top priority in every place they occupied, with the motto "occupy a place, form a battalion." Without the Green Standard Army continuously serving as an occupation force and cannon fodder, the Eight Banners would have been unable to complete the conquest of all of China. Even in the 20th century, with the rise of nationalism, the various puppet armies formed by the Japanese played a certain role in suppressing resistance bases and hindering guerrilla operations.

As the highest administrative official sent by the Senate to Jeju Island, Feng Zongze had been fully authorized by the Senate and the Executive Committee: he had the right to form "local security forces" that did not use firearms.

Besides the "Public Security Army," they also needed "collaborators." Feng Zongze knew this wouldn't be difficult—every society has a large number of disaffected individuals from all classes who, for various reasons, harbor resentment towards society and the government. As long as they were given the opportunity and the possibility of a change of dynasty, these people would jump out on their own.

Feng Zongze had no doubt that as soon as they took Jeju town and controlled the entire island, such people would appear immediately.

Since Jeju Island was a place where government slaves and exiles were concentrated, the number of malcontents was certainly greater than in all eight provinces of Korea combined. It should be easy to find "cooperators" among them. Not to mention the oppressed, potential "proletarian collaborators."

Feng Zongze and the other Senators also had another hope: to utilize the Chinese exiles on the island, including both Han and Mongols. According to the background information provided by the Grand Library, prisoners had been exiled to Tamra Island—that is, Jeju Island—since the Yuan Dynasty. Although Tamra had been annexed by Goryeo, it was actually under Mongol control during the Yuan Dynasty. In addition to exiling prisoners to the island, the Yuan also sent herdsmen to raise horses there. The fact that Jeju became an important horse-breeding ground was actually due to the Mongols, and the horse breed on the island also came from the Mongolian horses they introduced.

The Mongol influence on Jeju Island was so great that when the Yuan Dynasty was on its last legs, they once considered moving the court to the island and even began preparations to build a palace there. After the fall of the Yuan, the Joseon Dynasty spent a great deal of effort to subdue the Mongol herdsmen on the island and completely annex it.

Although the Ming Dynasty did not occupy Jeju Island, they exiled many Mongol nobles and Han officials loyal to the Yuan to Jeju. The Yuan's Prince of Liang from Yunnan and many of his subordinates were exiled here by the Hongwu Emperor. In his time, many of the Yuan, Liang, An, and Jiang surnames on the Korean peninsula were descendants of these people.

These people were not Koreans. Although they had been on Jeju Island for several centuries, they should still be different from the ordinary commoners on the island—and differences could be exploited.

As Feng Zongze was contemplating his work after the occupation of Jeju, his secretary entered.

"Reporting, sir."

"What is it?"

"One of the Haenyeo is very ill," the secretary said with some hesitation. "You instructed me to pay attention to the Haenyeo's condition and to report any situation immediately..."

The fishing village near Seongsan was now under their direct control. The fishermen who had fled had not yet returned, so the Haenyeo they had captured were still in the camp.

"I see. You did the right thing," Feng Zongze nodded. "Send a medic to check on them."

Saving lives was the easiest way to win people's hearts. Since Jeju Island was to be a refugee camp, the first fleet had brought a large amount of medicine and disinfectant. The medical staff was also well-equipped. It was no problem to offer some medical favors to the locals.

He suddenly stopped the secretary who was about to leave.

"Wait, I'll go and see her myself."

"Sir—" the secretary was surprised. She knew her master understood medicine, but she had not expected a Senator to personally treat a low-born captive.

Feng Zongze stood up. He had made up his mind: if he was going to win their hearts, he might as well do it thoroughly, starting with the few captives he had on hand.

Although the Haenyeo were of humble status and had no influence to speak of, the news of him personally treating them, once spread, would have a very good effect. To be a ruler, besides powerful military force, proclaiming "benevolence and righteousness" was also an effective means.

The Haenyeo spent long hours diving in the deep sea, holding their breath while working underwater. The high water pressure, combined with the lack of oxygen, made them prone to chronic headaches, hearing loss, tinnitus, gastrointestinal diseases, neuralgia, and arthritis. Additionally, due to the strong winds and high humidity, coughing and asthma were also common.

The Haenyeo was suffering from an abscess. This was a very common ailment for the people of Jeju Island, especially among the Haenyeo, where it seemed to be an occupational disease.

In every shrine on Jeju Island, there were offerings to the sea goddess and the Dragon King god, deities who were believed to protect people from skin diseases. In the shrines dedicated to the sea goddess, there was a custom of offering cooked rice with a boiled egg on top. This was a beautiful wish, hoping that one's skin would be as white and smooth as a peeled egg.

The seriously ill Haenyeo was none other than the woman of the Pan clan. Feng Zongze didn't need a thermometer. Just by looking at her flushed face and chapped lips, he knew she was running a fever.

This indicated that the inflammation was already quite severe. He put on gloves and pressed the area with his fingers. It was a typical abscess. It would have to be surgically incised and drained to be cured.
