"May the almighty God of Transmigration bless us, may the Time-Space Administration Bureau approve our actions. Amen."

[Wen Desi][y002] muttered the words, then, shouldering his assault pack, he was the first to step through the wormhole, followed closely by [Xiao Zishan][y001] and [Wang Luobin][y003].

[Wen Desi][y002] was an avid hiker and had a full set of camping and travel gear at home, making him well-equipped. However, he only chose to bring quick-dry clothing, a survival kit, a multi-purpose knife, and an assault pack to carry the wormhole exit.

As for weapons, [Wen Desi][y002] had considered his all-steel crossbow and hunting knife, but then thought that if something really happened, it would be a bit of a stretch for three urban nerds to compete in strength and ferocity with people from the Ming Dynasty. In any case, the wormhole exit could be moved at will, so if danger arose, they could just open the wormhole and escape. To be cautious, [Wen Desi][y002] took out three anti-stab vests, some smoke bombs, and stun guns, which could be used to get away in an emergency.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] had no such equipment. He went directly to one of the many military surplus and labor protection stores on the street and bought a set of training clothes, a pair of high-top Jiefang boots, and a replica military backpack.

[Wang Luobin][y003] wore his usual outdoor work clothes. Each person brought two days' worth of compressed biscuits and a few bottles of purified water. They also brought some emergency medicine. This was just to minimize the chances of having to open the wormhole, to avoid exposure.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] had brought a wide variety of promotional items. At first, they planned to only bring glass cups and plastic powder boxes, but later they thought it would be better to bring a little of everything—after all, they didn't know the aesthetic tastes and needs of the Ming people, so it was better to bring more samples to test the waters.

After determining the crossing point, [Xiao Zishan][y001] went to the library several times and roughly found the current location of Haopan Street. He found a budget hotel nearby and rented a room. Then, for several days, [Wen Desi][y002] would slightly open the wormhole at night to observe the environment on the other side—Haopan Street was a commercial area, after all, and densely populated. If they opened the wormhole randomly, they might end up in someone's bedroom or right on a busy street. To be safe, [Wen Desi][y002] simply ordered infrared night vision goggles online. If the location was not suitable, they would have to change places again—it was a complete gamble.

According to [Wen Desi][y002]'s several nighttime observations, the space on the other side should be the backyard of some mansion. He could see many rows of gray brick and tile houses, and it was completely deserted after dark.

No one really knew what would happen after they crossed over, and there was nowhere to consult. The preliminary plan was to hide in a secluded place after crossing over, and as soon as it was light, they would find a shop, show their samples, and see how the other party reacted.

What attitude the 17th-century ancients would have towards these three strangely dressed people was unpredictable: whether they would avoid them or cause a large crowd of uninformed people to gather. There was also the language barrier, but, according to [Chief Wen][y002], Cantonese was the dialect that preserved the most components of ancient Chinese, so the difference might not be as great as with modern Mandarin.

The time was set for around 5 a.m., which was the beginning of the mao hour in ancient times. Any earlier, and it would still be dark. Although the Ming and Qing dynasties did not have a clear curfew system, nightlife was quiet, and there were few pedestrians at night. If they were discovered by the night watchman or a patrolling yamen runner, they would be questioned. Any later, and more people would be up and about their business, greatly increasing the possibility of the wormhole being seen opening—three people appearing out of thin air would surely cause a sensation throughout Guangzhou.

Master Gao Ju had been feeling that he couldn't sleep soundly at night these past few days. The few dogs in the warehouse yard behind would always bark incessantly at night. The household guards went to check several times, but found nothing unusual. The warehouse yard itself was a place for storing goods. The walls were not only high, but there were also side courtyards and alleys on both sides. Even for a top-notch thief, it would not be so easy to sneak in. Thus, some people became suspicious, saying that a strange light often appeared in the courtyard in the middle of the night. For a time, the Gao residence was in a state of panic. It was fine during the day, but as soon as night fell, the warehouse became a place everyone avoided. The celestial phenomena had also been strange these days. In the evening, there was always rolling thunder, but no rain, and the sky often turned a strange purple. Master Gao was also in a bad mood, and he was too lazy to even favor his most beloved concubine.

It wasn't that Master Gao was afraid of ghosts, but that the warehouse in the backyard was a matter of life and death for him. Of the hundreds of large and small businesses on Haopan Street, every single one had made its fortune by trading with foreigners. Now, he had converted all the goods and silver he had obtained from the Franks last winter into raw silk, satin, and porcelain that the Franks liked. He had also prepared a lot of saltpeter and ironware, the export of which was explicitly prohibited by the imperial court. If anything went wrong, wouldn't it be the end of him—and his life was a small matter. Half of his vast enterprise belonged to Eunuch Yang in the palace. Although Eunuch Yang was not as prominent as the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old, it would not be difficult for him to have his entire family wiped out.

Tonight, the dogs were quite quiet and didn't bark again. Master Gao had a good night's sleep. Because of his unease these past few days, he had been sleeping alone in his inner study. Just after the fifth watch, he got up. Under the service of a maid, he brushed his teeth with green salt and washed his face. He was squinting at the half-dark sky, wondering about the weather and whether he should go to the courtyard for some fun...

There was another burst of frantic barking from the backyard. Master Gao couldn't help but be startled. His pleasant morning mood was completely ruined. He slammed down his cup and was about to call someone to investigate when he saw the head of his household guards come tumbling and crawling straight into the courtyard. Master Gao's face changed dramatically. This was the inner study, and male servants were not allowed to enter without being summoned. For the head guard to rush in in such a panic, it was obvious that something major had happened.

"Master, Master, the warehouse yard... in the yard... there are... there are..."

"What's the rush? Speak slowly." Master Gao had been smuggling foreign goods for many years and had long since developed a calm demeanor in the face of danger. After a moment of panic, he calmed down.

"The backyard, the backyard, three Japanese have come!"

Hearing that there were three Japanese in the backyard, although Master Gao didn't quite understand how they had gotten in, as long as they were people, it was manageable. He breathed a sigh of relief and said, "A few Japanese have scared you like this! Tie them up first and lock them in the woodshed." He waved his sleeve with an air of importance, but his mind was racing.

Could they be men sent by Boss Wang from Youyu Island? Has a foreign ship docked? Gao Ju knew that the Franks often had Japanese servants, but it wasn't time for the ships to arrive. Besides, as his partner, Boss Wang wouldn't send a few Japanese over without giving him a heads-up, let alone sneak them into his backyard.

"Master, these Japanese... are truly strange!" the head guard hurriedly reported. "We didn't dare to act rashly."

"Good-for-nothing! Useless!" Master Gao was furious, but he was also a little scared. Although he was a sojourner from another province, he had heard many stories about the ferocious nature of the Japanese pirates who had plundered the coast in the early years. The reason Haopan Street was now enclosed within the city walls was also because of the rampant Japanese pirates back then. For these three people to sneak into his backyard in the dead of night without anyone knowing, perhaps... Master Gao remembered hearing from a sea merchant who knew Japanese that there were some extraordinary warriors in Japan who were skilled in stealth and assassination...

At this thought, he was greatly frightened. The idea of having his servants capture them first faded away. He quickly asked, "Where are these three people now?"

"We have them surrounded in the backyard with bows and muskets," the head guard glanced at Master Gao's face. "From their appearance, they don't seem to have any ill intentions..."

"Bastard!" If they had no ill intentions, what were they doing in his backyard? Were they here to buy soy sauce?

"Master, these men have no weapons. This is a small box that their leader threw to us." The head guard quickly handed over a small box from his bosom. "He also said many things, but I couldn't understand them very well."

Master Gao took the paper box half-believingly, but was startled. The box was incredibly smooth to the touch, as if it had been glazed, but the rough edges immediately told him it was a paper box.

He thought to himself: Truly strange. He carefully opened the box. Inside was a small, oval, flat box. The material was neither jade nor porcelain, and like the paper box, it seemed to have a layer of porcelain glaze. The color was a vibrant pink he had never seen on porcelain before, and it was very light in his hand. Master Gao had been dealing in foreign goods for many years and was very knowledgeable, but he couldn't tell what it was made of. It looked similar to a woman's powder box. He tried to lift the lid, and it opened like a clamshell. He saw a bright, shining surface inside. He looked closely, and his face turned ashen!
