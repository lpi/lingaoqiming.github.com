Shortly after [Xiao Zishan][y001] returned to his office, Zhao Manxiong called him on his PHS phone.

"Actually, I don't really approve of you going to see him in person," Zhao Manxiong's voice was still gentle and soft over the PHS microphone. "But I can understand your feelings."

"I'm half-convinced by what he said."

"You can fully believe what he says. He's not a liar who loves to tell falsehoods."

"Alright, I completely trust your judgment. But is it crossing the line to use certain means against a certain Elder?"

"That lady is much more active than you imagine. You and I both know the harm she's doing. But I think you're well aware that everything she's done so far is legal. You can't find any fault with her from a legal standpoint."

"That's why I find it a bit difficult to decide."

"Giving a little humanitarian treatment to an Elder who has been severely punished for a long time is not a difficult decision," Zhao Manxiong said. "Currently, all her actions are legal. The Executive Committee and the Elder Council cannot infringe on her rights. Similarly, as long as Comrade Xin does not murder, commit arson, or attempt to rape a female Elder again, then his basic rights as an Elder should also be guaranteed. This is also legal."

"I understand what you mean. But..."

"Listen to his words, observe his actions."

"What if he falls back into his old habits?"

"Then we'll act according to the law."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] hung up the phone. He was clearly aware of the risks involved. Once something went wrong, the person who had "loosened the chain" for him would definitely have to bear the responsibility. After all, Xin Wuzui was a "marked" man.

He repeatedly assessed the risks and consequences for a long time and decided to trust Zhao Manxiong. Besides, some risks had to be taken.

Zhao Manxiong was right about one thing: everything Cheng Yongxin had done so far was within the framework permitted by the Elder Council. It could also be said to be an open conspiracy.

He believed that Cheng Yongxin herself was not really interested in so-called feminism, democracy, or freedom. She was more concerned with pursuing her own political power. These fancy words were just various pretexts she used to seize greater power within the Elder Council system.

It could be said that this was a political struggle among the Elders. However, what worried him was that certain elements within it were becoming the beginning of a struggle between the Elders and the naturalized citizens, even though these naturalized citizens currently had no subjective demands and were merely being used as tools.

What Cheng Yongxin sought was her own political power, but from a higher perspective, her actions, along with those of some other marginal Elders, would determine the overall political ecology of Lingao in the future. From some of the information he had gathered—Cheng Yongxin secretly training maids to act as her eyes and ears to gather information, Yang Xinwu attempting to become the headmaster of the Whampoa Military Academy—it could be seen that these intentional or unintentional actions would ultimately raise the level of awareness and cultural knowledge of the naturalized citizens, allowing them to participate in the political games of the Elders.

This was a very dangerous signal. [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought, back during the Maid Revolution, Dugu Qiuhun's attempt to use the police to "suppress the riot" had already shown this tendency. Now, Cheng Yongxin and Yang Xinwu were unconsciously treading the same path, only in a more subtle way and less likely to be caught.

What worried [Xiao Zishan][y001] the most was that in the current internal power struggles of the Elder Council, a very bad trend had emerged: conflicts of interest were gradually being artificially colored as conflicts of values—autocracy versus democracy, left versus right, group conflicts, incumbents versus "soy sauce" members, men versus women, etc.

Although most of these conflicts were just reasons and excuses, it was too much to emphasize value and ethnic conflicts among a mere five hundred people. At this stage, the essence of the conflict was unequal interests or the fear of unequal interests. If the "coloring" of interest conflicts was allowed to develop, it would push the conflict in an irreconcilable direction. Conflicts of values are the most intense. It's not uncommon for family members to turn against each other, let alone a motley crew gathered for personal gain.

"Our pie is still too small, otherwise it wouldn't have come to this," [Xiao Zishan][y001] lamented. In the end, it was because the Elder Council's cake was still too small. Every Elder wanted to share as much of the transmigration dividend as possible, and they could no longer be fooled by promises of "in the future, you will have..."

Lingao seemed to be thriving now, but it was actually treading on thin ice. Any division would lead to Lingao's destruction. After all, Lingao could only rely on these five hundred or so people. Power struggles and conflicts of interest must be regulated and confined within a certain range. Otherwise, if someone continued to use the Elders' innate power to agitate and incite, the consequences would be unimaginable. It must be curbed as soon as possible.

Despite this, arranging a new position for Xin Wuzui was quite a headache. His gaze fell on a pile of documents on his desk, one of which was an application from Hong Huangnan to open an Elder's club. Hong Huangnan had mentioned this to him several times, but he had always felt it wasn't urgent. After all, the General Office had already established a special supply system. Besides, during the full swing of Operation Engine, it wasn't appropriate to waste resources on such luxurious and decadent things. In particular, some of the "service items" made [Xiao Zishan][y001] feel uncomfortable. He also subconsciously felt that the Elder Council should maintain a certain "ascetic" and "glorious and righteous" image.

However, right now, "bread and circuses" were indeed needed to soothe the restless emotions of the Elders that had been stirred up. [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought, *This person is also a talent in this area. He can be used here, and at the same time, we can continue to exploit his human computing function—this office in Dongmen Market is much closer to the Finance Directorate than Gaoshanling.* Old Hong was also a very reasonable person.

Out of caution, he decided to call Ma Jia. He had been the main legal consultant during the trial of the Four of the Black. He wanted to consult him about changing Xin Wuzui's job.

But Ma Jia was not in his office. His secretary said that today was the day of the Yang Jihong case trial, and Ma Jia had gone to the Dongmen City court in person.

Ma Jia was currently resting in the judge's chambers at the court. He felt completely relaxed after leaving the courtroom. Although he had spent the better part of the day in the public gallery and his back was a little sore, he was in a very good mood.

The trial of Yang Jihong was finally over. Although the formal sentencing would be at the next hearing, overall, the entire trial process was much better than he had expected. It could be called a perfect demonstration of the law.

The trial of this case followed the Executive Committee's policy of "no publicity, no concealment" and was held publicly at the Dongmen City Simple Court. According to normal procedures, it was announced on the bulletin board in advance.

Although the principle of "no publicity" was followed, the Yang Jihong case was only briefly reported in the *Lingao Times*. Anyone with a slight understanding of the Australian system knew that both parties involved were the Elders' "pillow partners." Therefore, there were many who were keenly interested in how the Elders would handle this case: the old and new gentry of Lingao County who were concerned about the Australians' every move, the middle and upper classes of the naturalized citizens, and the life secretaries who had a personal connection to the matter all noticed the announcement of the trial. Therefore, when the trial finally began, although the courtroom was not as packed as the last time a case of damaging a military marriage was tried, the public gallery was still two-thirds full.

Ma Jia, at a meeting of the Arbitration Court, had demanded that everyone in the Law Society fully implement the "rule of law" and emphasize that "the procedures and processes must be completely legal." Therefore, every step in this trial was conducted strictly in accordance with the draft "Criminal Procedure Law." When the relevant personnel appeared in court, a环节 (huánjié - segment) of swearing an oath to the "Elder Council and the people" was added.

To implement the new law's principle of "emphasizing physical evidence over testimony," Ma Jia specially arranged for witnesses from the forensic and legal medicine fields, who were naturalized citizen students, to testify and demonstrate the evidence on the spot.

It was clear that although the naturalized citizens and natives in the gallery did not fully understand these things, they showed great interest. Autopsies and physical evidence were also present in ancient yamen trials, but due to technical and conceptual limitations, they were very crude, almost a formality. Trials mainly relied on the testimony of both parties and witnesses. Obtaining a confession often became the sole purpose of the trial, and for this, torture was used extensively. Not only were the criminals inevitably tortured, but innocent witnesses whose testimony did not meet the presiding official's expectations would also be tortured.

In contrast, although Australian trials also had testimony and witnesses, the key was the physical evidence. Through the prosecutor's description, a complete timeline of the case was gradually formed, and each point was proven with physical evidence, one link after another, both rigorous and clear. The difference was stark.

Ma Jia was very satisfied with today's trial. The entire trial process was completely in line with legal procedures, and all parties performed well: from the new Song-style judicial robes and hats, the newly renovated and solemn courtroom, to the naturalized citizen legal staff who spoke the "new language"... Among them, Ji Xin's performance was particularly outstanding: the prosecution had charged her with "intentional injury causing death." Since the evidence was conclusive, he did not use an innocence defense. Instead, he focused on "extenuating circumstances." Not only did he call multiple naturalized citizen witnesses, but he also read out signed testimonies from several Elders to prove that while Lin Xiaoya's death was a tragedy, her own actions were also a major cause of the incident. Therefore, Yang Jihong was in a state of "crime of passion" due to emotional distress, and he pleaded with the court to take this into consideration during sentencing.

His defense was not only well-supported by evidence, but his mournful expression and compassionate words also aroused the sympathy of many naturalized citizens and natives in the audience. After he finished his closing statement, the defendant, Yang Jihong, was sobbing uncontrollably, and there were sighs throughout the gallery.

A few of the more emotional women were already in tears.
