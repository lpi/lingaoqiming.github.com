"I was out for a walk," Zhou Zhongjun said nonchalantly, "and when I passed by the Nanbao Bookstore, I saw a few people acting suspiciously at the counter. The moment they saw me, they quickly hid a book under a pile. I figured they were up to no good—you know how we're always supposed to uphold justice. I couldn't just ignore it. So, I followed them. And guess what?"

Huang Zhen groaned inwardly. *My lady, we're on a deadly mission here, not trying to build a reputation as wandering heroes. If you had shouted, "Zhou Zhongjun of the Hengshan Sect is here," we'd all be in the髡's jail by now.*

He knew her curiosity had likely gotten the better of her again. He had no choice but to play along. "What happened?"

"It turns out they were selling exam questions," she announced triumphantly. "The髡's require a license for everything. But the exam questions have already been leaked and are being sold under the table. You can buy anything you want..."

"So you bought this?"

"At first, they denied having the book. But I scared them a little, told them they looked suspicious and that I was going to the police. They immediately caved and sold it to me. Only twenty circulation coupons!" Zhou Zhongjun seemed quite proud of herself.

Huang Zhen, being a seasoned veteran of the world, felt a knot of unease in his stomach. While cheating on imperial examinations was rampant in the Great Ming, it was always done discreetly, usually through intermediaries. After all, people's lives and fortunes were at stake.

Here in Lingao, even though this license exam wasn't the imperial civil service exam, many people's livelihoods depended on it. Logically, the髡 would punish cheating severely. They wouldn't be so lax as to allow exam questions to be sold openly on the street.

Huang Zhen's suspicion grew. *Could this be a scam?* Based on Zhou Zhongjun's account, it sounded like a classic con.

With that thought, he quickly flipped through the thin, cotton-paper booklet again. He couldn't tell if the questions and answers were real, but when he reached the last page, he spotted a tiny line of text in the footer: "Copied from the 1633 edition of 'Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Qualification Exam Mock Questions,' published by the Ministry of Health Press. Copyright belongs to the original author." Below that was a stamp: "Manual Copying Permit No. 66," and finally the price: 20 circulation coupons.

Huang Zhen almost fainted. It was a complete sham!

No wonder some of the phrases looked familiar. He quickly rummaged through the pile of reference books on the table and pulled one out. It was the "Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Qualification Exam Mock Questions," published by the Ministry of Health Press. The version he had was from 1634, so the content was slightly different, and it had only cost him 3 circulation coupons.

Huang Zhen didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The young lady had fallen for a common street scam.

Seeing the strange expression on his face, Zhou Zhongjun knew something was wrong. She snatched the book from his hands. A single glance was enough. Her beautiful face flushed crimson, her eyebrows shot up, and she ground her pearly teeth with an audible 'clack.' "How dare they cheat me! They'll regret this." She started to storm out.

Huang Zhen quickly stopped her. "No! We are in a precarious situation. We absolutely cannot get into a conflict..."

"Are you saying we're afraid of a few petty髡's lackeys?"

"We are not afraid of them, but our mission will be ruined!" Huang Zhen added, hoping to add weight to his words, "Think of how we'll face our superiors when we return!"

This struck a chord with Zhou Zhongjun. She knew her sect had invested heavily in this operation. If she were to jeopardize it, she would, at the very least, be expelled.

Life in the Hengshan Sect wasn't paradise, but it was free and easy. Her master rarely disciplined her, and aside from not being allowed to leave the mountain without permission and her daily training, she could do as she pleased. Her family was wealthy, constantly sending her money and supplies, and had even bought her a personal maid. Her lifestyle was no different from when she was at home. If she were sent back, she would have to endure her parents' nagging about marriage—not to mention her unbound feet. To marry into a good family, she would have to bind them, even if just for show. The thought alone sent a shiver down her spine.

But she couldn't swallow her pride. Her eyes reddened, and tears welled up. It was a trivial matter of twenty circulation coupons, but she had never been so humiliated since she first set out on her adventures. And now, here in Lingao, she had been duped by a few low-life scammers.

She gritted her teeth. "Brother Huang, I understand what's at stake! Tonight, we'll go together, kill those bastards, and burn that bookstore to the ground!"

Huang Zhen knew she couldn't let it go. He said in a low, serious voice, "Absolutely not! This is not Ming territory. If you start a fire, the髡's agents will launch a city-wide manhunt in Nanbao. How could we possibly hide?"

"So we just have to eat this loss?!" Zhou Zhongjun's teeth were grinding again.

"Be patient for now! When the time comes for our move, it won't just be this little bookstore. We'll set the entire city of Nanbao ablaze!"

His words finally seemed to placate her. Even so, Zhou Zhongjun remained sullen. On her way upstairs, she saw Nan Wan'er sweeping the floor and snapped, "You slut! What are you sweeping for? Just putting on a show!"

Huang Zhen saw it all. He felt sorry for Nan Wan'er, but his mind was consumed with the exams and opening the shop. He had no energy left to comfort the girl.

The certification business was looking grim. Jiao and Song had already given up. As for the Meng brothers, it was uncertain if they could pass. He had inquired around; getting the certificate was no easy feat. Even the "naturalized citizens" who had been in Lingao for a year or two had to enroll in a "training course." Passing by studying at home was a rare achievement.

This "training course," he heard, was located in the East Gate Market and was called "New Lingao." It was a joint venture between Lingao's largest pharmacy, Runshitang, and the Ministry of Health. Rumor had it that the Ministry's two leaders, Liu and Deng, even had private shares in it. In any case, anyone who enrolled in the course had a very high pass rate.

Huang Zhen had initially thought it was something like the stationery shops in the capital that provided back channels for cheating in the imperial exams. He figured he could just pay his way through. But to his surprise, enrolling in the training course required passing an entrance exam first: regardless of whether one was a naturalized citizen or a local, you needed at least a B-level literacy certificate to be accepted.

This drove Huang Zhen mad. What kind of place was this? One certificate after another! Even under the founding emperor of their dynasty, with the strict 'Yellow Book' household registration and travel pass system, the net had never been this tight. They were finding it difficult to make any move at all.

And on top of it all, he had the trouble-magnet Zhou Zhongjun by his side. When his masters had briefed him, they'd said that women in the髡's territory worked openly, so bringing a few female disciples would be a good cover.

But since arriving in Lingao, Zhou Zhongjun had refused to lift a finger, doing nothing but wander around and shop all day. Far from being a cover, she was a magnet for attention.

If he didn't open the shop soon and give her a proper identity, she was bound to cause trouble.

After much thought, Huang Zhen, feeling utterly helpless, decided he had no choice but to consult the "female director." Perhaps she could pull some strings for them.

Knowing she wouldn't accept gifts, he didn't bother bringing any. He went to the branch office, where no announcement was needed. He asked the doorman, learned the director was in her office, and went straight in.

The female director was delighted to see Huang Zhen again. She gestured for him to sit in a rattan chair, enthusiastically served him tea, and then asked about his health, the progress of opening his shop, and if there was anything she could help with.

Huang Zhen laid out all his troubles. "...We all came from the Great Ming. We know nothing about these certifications and Australian rules. We want to take the exam, but it feels impossible. The people I've hired have been practicing medicine and selling remedies their whole lives. They are highly skilled, but they are old. To ask them to memorize the contents of these books now is just too difficult for them..."

The female director listened and nodded, her expression full of sympathy. When Huang Zhen finished, she smiled. "Don't worry. The Senate has always encouraged commerce and industry. However, the medical field is a matter of public safety. Allowing just anyone to practice medicine and sell drugs, like in the Great Ming, is a disregard for the health of the people. That's why the Senate has established these rules."

"Yes, yes, the Senate's benevolence is universal. Its spirit of serving the people is something I deeply admire," Huang Zhen replied respectfully, parroting a slogan he had seen on the street a few days earlier.

He then recounted the story of Zhou Zhongjun being scammed, not to "seek justice from the great official," but because he figured that once the scammers were caught by the髡 authorities, the matter would come to the attention of the officials.

It was better to be upfront about it than to be questioned later if it was discovered—he had no confidence in Zhou Zhongjun's ability to handle an interrogation. The amount of money involved was small, so it probably wouldn't attract too much attention. Fortunately, the髡 didn't engage in the practice of "letting the crime blossom," where Ming officials would use one case as a pretext to extort more money.

As he expected, the story didn't seem to pique the director's interest much. She simply nodded.

"Your situation is not uncommon here. People who have drifted through the old society and old system of the Great Ming for half their lives find it hard to adapt to the new society and new system. It's also harder for older people to learn new things. It's understandable that they feel daunted and want to find shortcuts. I understand all of this," she said, placing a hand on her chest, her eyes smiling, full of warmth.

"Yes, yes."

"This isn't the first time this has happened. And you're not the only ones who have been fooled. But for now, we haven't found a good way to handle it. These bookstore clerks are exploiting a legal loophole," the director explained. "They are taking advantage of the desperation of people like you."
