"No problem. Leave it to me," Qian Duoduo said nonchalantly. She added, "We're also rehearsing today. The ACE of the idol group 'Four Seasons Troupe' is making her debut, so we need a sensational effect. If you enter and exit through the staff entrance like everyone else, there's no drama. Arriving by boat is so much more stylish! I've already spoken with Auntie Panpan. The newspaper will be there to take your picture at the stadium's dock."

"That... that's not a good idea," Zhang Yunmi said shyly. "It's a bit much."

"Not at all, not at all. You're going to be a big star, you know. You need to have some self-awareness, okay?" Qian Duoduo abandoned her wind observation and turned to explain her "plan" for the five-hundredth time:

"...On the day of the performance, you'll arrive at the stadium dock on the *Cang*. Then you'll disembark and walk along the route to the stadium entrance. The other girls from the Four Seasons Troupe will be waiting for you at the bottom of the steps. There will be a large crowd of spectators on both sides of the street, and reporters taking pictures..."

"Isn't that like walking the red carpet?" Lin Ziqi interjected.

"Exactly, that's the feeling we're going for," Qian Duoduo said. "We don't have a red carpet, so we'll make do for now. The point is, the atmosphere has to be grand, it has to be enthusiastic..."

As she was speaking, Sonia suddenly said, "There's someone waving at us up ahead."

Qian Duoduo turned and walked to the bow. On a wooden platform by the riverbank, a young girl lay soaking wet, while a Fāngcǎodì female student stood on the dock, waving frantically at the *Cang*.

"What's going on?" Lin Ziqi asked.

"It looks like someone fell into the water. They're calling for help," Qian Duoduo said, raising her binoculars. "They look like naturalized citizens. Probably on their way to the stadium to watch the rehearsal."

"What should we do? Should we approach?" Zhong Xiaoying was at the helm.

Qian Duoduo didn't answer. She cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted, "Hey—what's wrong?"

"Drowning—" the female student shouted back. "It's—my—friend. Help us..."

"Alright. Wait there, we're coming."

"Let's go closer," Qian Duoduo said. "We can't just leave them to die. My mom taught me first aid for drowning—besides, we're in the middle of nowhere. It's only a few kilometers to Dongmen Market. We can drop them off with the police at the water patrol post—they have police cars on standby. It's a win-win, and it won't delay us. Xiaoying, turn the rudder. Sonia, lower the sail!"

"Aye, aye." Zhong Xiaoying lightly turned the helm, and the *Cang* turned its hull and headed towards the platform.

The *Cang* was fast. In a short while, it was close to the platform. Just as it was about to dock, the "drowning victim" who had been lying on the ground leaped up. Several men and women armed with swords and knives emerged from the bushes by the dock and jumped towards the *Cang*.

Qian Duoduo screamed, "Xiaoying, turn the rudder, quick!" She drew the .357 revolver from her quick-draw holster and fired two shots.

*Bang, bang!* Two blossoms of blood appeared on the assassin's chest. His body went limp, and he fell onto the platform. Qian Duoduo took a step back, increasing the distance between herself and the assassin. Just then, *thwack, thwack, thwack!* Three throwing darts embedded themselves in the deck and mast.

"Everyone get down!" Qian Duoduo shouted as she swiveled her gun. Another double tap, and another assassin screamed and fell into the river, his body twisting. A bloom of blood instantly appeared on the water's surface.

Zhong Xiaoying reacted quickly. She reversed the rudder, and the *Cang*'s bow veered, its hull turning towards the center of the river. Before they could pull away, the last assassin had jumped onto the deck, shouting, "Die, Aussie scoundrel!"

The word "die" had barely left his lips when Qian Duoduo fired two more shots. The assassin staggered and fell into the Wenlan River.

"Quick, drop the sail!" Qian Duoduo shouted again, rolling back into the cabin. It all happened so fast that Lin Ziqi and the others hadn't even had time to react. The *Cang* had already drifted away, heading for the center of the river.

"Xiaoying, hold the rudder steady!" Qian Duoduo panted, her hands trembling. She fumbled in her pocket for the speedloader, which clattered onto the deck.

Zhong Xiaoying was趴at the helm, her face pale, but her hands were still on the wheel. Hearing Qian Duoduo's command, she quickly responded and righted the helm. Sonia and Lin Ziqi also came to their senses and scrambled to raise the sail.

Qian Duoduo reloaded, stood up, and fired several shots at the fleeing "female student" and "drowning victim." The "female student" staggered and fell to the ground. The "drowning victim," however, took the opportunity to escape.

"Quick, call Uncle Dongmen," Qian Duoduo said, holstering her pistol. "There are enemies!"

In the response headquarters, Mu Min, who had just received the latest situation report by phone, was sweating profusely. The situation was critical. The enemy had attacked an Elder's boat! Although she couldn't figure out why Qian Duoduo and the others had insisted on taking a boat to the stadium without guards, the enemy had launched an attack. And according to Qian Duoduo, one of the assassins was even wearing a National School female student's uniform! This coincided with the latest enemy intelligence report that had just been issued an hour ago.

The problem was that the intelligence report had come too late! Although the Political Security Bureau and the police had been ordered to tail every "suspect," there was no guarantee of one hundred percent success in surveillance, and no one had expected the enemy to disguise themselves as female students.

Female student uniforms were simply not available on the market. The National Police had once cracked down hard on businesses that counterfeited student uniforms and military and police uniforms, basically eliminating such counterfeit goods.

How did they get them?

The report said that the enemy had obtained a total of three sets of female student uniforms. Since Qian Duoduo had already taken down one, there were still two at large. They might have already blended into the student crowd at the stadium. If they were to make a move, the scene would definitely descend into chaos. Even if the authorities had increased the personal security for the Elders, the consequences of either the enemy escaping in the chaos or causing mass casualties among the students were unbearable.

There was no time to lose. They had to close the net as soon as possible. A few dozen minutes ago, Wu Mu had informed her that the Political Security Bureau's action team had moved into their designated positions and were preparing to arrest the suspects.

She picked up the phone. "Connect me to the Detective Squad! Old Zhou! Get your men moving immediately. Yes, leave no one behind. Everyone into the operational area. Arrest them according to the list!"

She slammed down the phone and shook it violently. "Connect me to the Fāngcǎodì duty office! Yes, urgent. I need to speak to an Elder!"

The person who answered the phone was Yuan Ziguang. Hearing Mu Min say that the Fāngcǎodì and College of Arts and Sciences faculty and staff should immediately go to the scene to identify the students, Yuan Ziguang was thrown into a panic. But a problem quickly arose: today was a rest day, and many students had not come to the venue as part of a school-organized group. It was obviously not an easy task to organize students from different schools and classes in a sea of people.

"Then what other way do you have to quickly verify the students' identities?" Mu Min's voice was hoarse with tension over the phone.

On the other end of the line, a group of Elders from the education department were also wiping sweat from their brows. Both Fāngcǎodì and the College of Arts and Sciences had uniforms, but at this time, photo IDs were still limited to the military, police, and political security departments, and had not been issued to ordinary students. Relying on student ID cards to verify the authenticity of students was not very reliable. Besides, the enemy was already on the scene and could launch an attack at any time.

Bai Yu, the head of the Industrial Arts Teaching and Research Group, spoke slowly, "In this matter, I think we can only test the effectiveness of our usual disciplinary training for the students."

Zhou Zhongjun, Nan Wan'er, and several other female disciples had split up and blended into the plaza in front of the stadium. She and Nan Wan'er, dressed in student uniforms, had, as Sima Qiudao had instructed, tried to get as close as possible to the special passage that the Elders would use to enter.

On both sides of the passage, ropes had been set up as a security line, and the public was not allowed to cross. There were also many police and Security Army soldiers on guard. However, they did not prohibit the naturalized citizens from approaching the passage. Many pseudo-Aussie students in school uniforms had gathered on both sides of the passage, chattering excitedly.

There were many people in the plaza. Although it wasn't yet a sea of people, some areas were already becoming crowded. The police had begun to set up barricades at several entrances to restrict and direct the flow of people.

The plaza was mostly filled with naturalized citizens, but there were also many local residents who had come to watch the excitement. The accents were a mix of southern and northern. The few of them, blending in, were both excited and scared. Zhou Zhongjun was particularly excited. She had chosen the best-fitting of the student uniforms sent over by Seventh Master. Paired with her tall figure and飒爽英姿, it had a unique charm. Zhou Zhongjun, intending to humiliate Nan Wan'er, insisted that she was highly skilled in martial arts and should pose as a female student. She then deliberately gave her the smallest set of clothes.

Poor Nan Wan'er, her chest was tight, and the hem of her skirt was above her knees. With the slightest movement, a large section of her white thighs would be exposed. She didn't dare to pull the skirt down. The female student uniform's blouse was very short, only covering her waist. If she pulled the skirt down even a little, her waist and hips would be exposed, making her look even more ridiculous. She could only walk hunched over, step by step. Nan Wan'er felt like dying—she had refused to go out at first, but after a torrent of abuse from Zhou Zhongjun, she had finally gone out with tears in her eyes. Seeing Nan Wan'er's predicament, Zhou Zhongjun felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction. *You love to flirt with men, don't you? Let's see you flirt your fill!*

But as they walked outside, Nan Wan'er became the center of attention, completely overshadowing her. Almost every man stared at Nan Wan'er as if bewitched, and a few handsome men even had nosebleeds on the spot. The more Zhou Zhongjun walked, the angrier she became. *That damn flirt knows how to seduce men so well. When the time comes, I'll definitely push her to the front to block a bullet. That'll satisfy the hatred in my heart!*

Just then, a soft melody suddenly filled the air, instantly spreading throughout the plaza. The few of them were startled, wondering where a band of musicians was hidden, and why the music was so loud.
