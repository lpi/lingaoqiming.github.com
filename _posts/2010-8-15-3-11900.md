"Not bad," Hu Qingbai said with a laugh. The Ministry of Education's office building was located in the park—a two-story red brick and red tile building. Moving out of the government compound meant they could have their own office building, instead of being crammed into a few simple office rooms.

Just inside the school gate was a large stone pedestal, which was empty. A few students from the National School were climbing on it. When they saw a "superior" coming, they all jumped down and ran away.

"This is the pedestal for a statue," Mei Wan said. The Ministry of Education had originally planned to erect a statue of a great man—but there was still a debate about which great man to choose, so it was left blank for now.

The playground was very large, a standard 400-meter track. There were all kinds of equipment, such as horizontal bars, parallel bars, and climbing poles. There were also soccer goals made of wooden frames and fishing nets. Next to it, there was even a basketball court, not only with basketball hoops, but also well-made. Xiao Zishan admired Wu Kuangming, who was in charge of forestry and wood products—his skills were getting better and better.

However, the students were just walking, playing, and using the equipment on the playground. No one was playing soccer or basketball.

"No basketballs or soccer balls?"

"There are a few, we found a few from the ship..." Hu Qingbai was about to say, "they were all taken by the General Office," but then he remembered that the person who came was the director of the General Office, so he swallowed his words. He said, "—not enough. We wanted to make them ourselves, but Mo Xiaoan said that applying for rubber reserves to make soccer balls and basketballs would definitely be rejected."

"Didn't they say that soccer also existed in ancient China? Gao Qiu was very good at it. Can't we make a Song Dynasty version of a soccer ball?" Xiao Zishan didn't even remember the "ball snatching" incident.

"It's not the same thing," Hu Qingbai thought to himself that the director of the General Office was quite good at making random associations.

"It can't be inflated, it has no elasticity," Xiao Zishan suddenly remembered that the army often played rugby on the training ground as a form of confrontational training. Last time he went to Yanchang Village, he also saw the young people in the village playing rugby. For rugby, the requirements for the ball were not high, and the level of confrontation was more intense.

"We can teach everyone to play rugby, yes, yes," Xiao Zishan said. "Xi Yazhou has promoted it well in Yanchang Village. And baseball! The equipment is not difficult to make."

"Isn't rugby too confrontational?" Bai Yu expressed his concern. "Children are prone to injury."

"American children also play rugby," Xiao Zishan waved his hand. "We want to be the 17th-century America!"

This incongruous analogy left everyone speechless. On second thought, the transmigrator group also had this intention—who didn't like the title of world hegemon?

So it was decided to include rugby and baseball in the school's sports program. The army would be responsible for teaching rugby, and the special reconnaissance team would be responsible for baseball. As a second-generation Chinese-American, Xue Ziliang was naturally no stranger to the most popular sports in the United States.

The lime water on the newly built teaching building had not yet dried, and it had not been put into use. The whole building was quiet. In Xiao Zishan's opinion, the facilities in the classroom were similar to the primary school he had attended as a child. The windows were large and fitted with glass to make the most of natural light. However, because wooden windows were used, the glass area was small, and the lighting efficiency was slightly weaker.

"No electric lights installed?" Xiao Zishan noticed that there were reserved positions on the beams and ceiling of the roof, but they were empty.

"No, we don't have the technology to make light bulbs. The use of light bulbs is now strictly controlled. The Industrial and Energy Committee said that we can use carbide lamps at night in the future—they can handle that."

The blackboards, desks, and chairs were of a standard style. Except for the blackboards at the front and back, which were painted black, all the desks and chairs were in their original, unfinished state. However, Xiao Zishan thought it was already very good that Wu Kuangming could get a group of 17th-century peasant workers to make 20th-century furniture.

In the blank space above the blackboard, some slogans familiar to the transmigrators had already been brushed on the white-washed wall with ink: "Study hard and make progress every day," "Cultivate your character," "Knowledge is power."

...and so on, and so forth.

The classroom number was nailed to the door of the classroom. Hu Qingbai said that in order to increase the efficiency of the classroom, they would not adopt the model of one class per classroom, but rather a model similar to that of a university, where students would go to different classrooms for different classes. This would maximize the use of the classrooms.

"That doesn't make much sense, does it?" Xiao Zishan asked. "Let's not talk about universities. Primary and secondary school students are in school from 7 am to 5 pm. Except for the evening, there's almost no free time for the classrooms."

"No, our education system is based on pragmatism," Hu Qingbai said with confidence. "One-third of the time is for cultural classes, one-third for labor practice, and one-third for military and physical training. So each class will probably not use the classroom for about half of the time."

This "three-thirds" education system received high praise from Ma Qianzhu. He said many times at meetings on education: "The Fangcaodi teaching experience is the one that can best reflect the spirit and superiority of the transmigrator group," "it is the perfect combination of theoretical study and social practice," and "it is a good model for cultivating new people with ideals, culture, and discipline."

The so-called labor practice class was, of course, not about making paper models with scissors and glue or playing with plasticine, but about going to the fields, factories, and enterprises to do real work as a laborer.

The campus itself also had a base for labor practice: a small farm, including a vegetable garden, a livestock farm, and a sizable biogas digester—using biogas for cooking was one aspect, and another purpose was to treat the large amount of human excrement and organic waste generated here without harm, turning it into fertilizer to be returned to the fields on the spot, saving the trouble of dealing with a large amount of sewage and filth.

There was even a simple wind-powered waterwheel on the bank of the farm's river for irrigation. There was also a row of large and small bamboo sheds with frame structures designed by Bingfeng.

"Many of the facilities on the farm were built by the students themselves," Hu Qingbai said. "Not just this practice farm, but the entire campus construction, the students participated a lot—these children used to study in the open air and read in their dormitories. Now that they can move into the rooms, they are all overjoyed, and their enthusiasm for labor is high!"

It seemed that Hu Qingbai himself had been infected. He said with gestures, "Take this simple waterwheel, for example. It was made by a few students themselves—not bad, right?"

"Indeed, not bad. But the waterwheel isn't turning—" Xiao Zishan looked at it. The water volume of this tributary of the Wenlan River was not large, so the waterwheel was not turning.

"It will be useful after we build a dam in the future," Hu Qingbai said enthusiastically. "This vegetable garden can be used by the students to grow vegetables. The livestock farm is prepared to raise pigs and sheep. The feed will be the swill from the cafeteria—"

"Swill?" Xiao Zishan had seen the natives eat. Given their珍惜程度 for food, it was hard to say that there would be much swill left over—this was not a 21st-century university.

"There is still some. The students can supplement the feed by growing pigweed and sweet potatoes, and by cutting pigweed. Raising sheep is even simpler, as long as the students cut grass," Hu Qingbai said. "The harvest from the vegetable garden and the farm will all be used to subsidize the food for the teachers and students, which can increase the self-sufficiency rate and reduce dependence."

"What about this bamboo shed?" Xiao Zishan walked into a bamboo shed. This bamboo shed was almost two stories high, with a frame made entirely of bamboo and walls made of bamboo mats and reed mats. The ground was compacted with a mixture of clay and sand. But it was not clear what this place was used for.

"This is the location of the school-run factory," Hu Qingbai introduced.

"What does the school-run factory produce?"

"There is no power machine, so we have to do manual work first. We can take on some outsourced processing—Wu Kuangming said he would outsource some of the rattan and straw weaving processing to us. The machinery factory has also agreed to help us make a few hand-cranked weaving machines. We can make safety helmets and straw hats. We can coordinate at the meeting to see what else we can do."

The next shed was much smaller. Inside, many bookshelf-like shelves had already been made and were neatly arranged.

"This can't be a library, can it?" Xiao Zishan couldn't think of what this place was intended for—it was too small and simple to be a library.

Everyone laughed. "We're preparing to grow some fungi. Oyster mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms... Huang Dashan will provide us with the strains and technical guidance."

"Aren't you afraid of technology proliferation?"

"It doesn't matter if the cultivation technology spreads. In fact, the more it spreads, the better. As long as the strains are controlled. This is Huang Dashan's patent."

"Let's go to the library now."

To Xiao Zishan's surprise, the library was actually a luxurious two-story building with a pointed roof, made of reinforced concrete. The gray reinforced concrete beams and columns were particularly prominent, embedded in the red brick walls. From the outside, the building was heavily guarded. The windows were not only fitted with iron bars but also had iron-clad shutters. The door was also clad in iron and fitted with a modern lock.

"The things here are particularly valuable, so it's this luxurious," Mei Wan said as he opened the lock. "Otherwise, I wouldn't be willing to use reinforced concrete."

This was a building that served as both a library and a laboratory. The library was located on the well-ventilated second floor. The reading room was bright, and the rows of newly made bookshelves in the spacious book repository were still empty for the time being. There were only some thread-bound books purchased from Guangzhou, such as classics, history, and literature, and another part was the newly printed textbooks and the monthly bound volumes of the "Lin'gao Times." Textbooks were a big problem. In order to print books on a large scale, Zhou Dongtian was still studying with the chemical department to solve the problem of printing press ink. Once it was solved, the books here would be quickly enriched.

The first floor was a complete set of four laboratories for physics, chemistry, and biology, configured according to the standards of a secondary school laboratory, as well as related equipment storage rooms. What particularly shocked Xiao Zishan was that there was even an electrical laboratory! Xiao Zishan was not involved in the work of the Planning Committee, but he also knew how precious the electrical equipment installed in the laboratory was to the transmigrators now.
