If she could really provide clues, it would indeed be a great merit for the chief. But the matter was too incredible, and Guo Xi'er couldn't help but feel a little suspicious. She remembered that when she was receiving training, the elder who taught the security class had said that they should be wary of natives using certain excuses to get close to the chief and take the opportunity to assassinate them.

As if seeing through Guo Xi'er's thoughts, Miss Dong said, "Don't be afraid, miss. I am not a person who is willing to risk her life to be an assassin. If I were willing to die, I would have hanged myself long ago. Since I was not willing to die then, I will not die now. If you are still not at ease, you can send a few capable maids to search me carefully."

Guo Xi'er thought to herself that this woman had a big mouth. She didn't seem like an ordinary official's daughter. She said, "Miss Dong, the chief is busy talking to someone. I will report it when he is free."

The young girl curtsied again and said, "Thank you, miss... you have a bodhisattva's heart... my name is Dong Mingdang. You can just call me Mingdang from now on."

Liu Xiang and Lu Yizhong talked for more than an hour before Lu Yizhong left with satisfaction—regardless of whether Elder Liu would accept his suggestion, his attitude towards him was still quite dependent. Under the rule of the Great Song Senate, his future would not be too bad.

Liu Xiang was much more entangled. The gentry and old intellectuals were an important problem they had to face. Although the Senate was quite lenient in its overall authorization—whether it was him or [Wen Desi][y002], they had almost full authority in local administrative leadership—this did not mean that he could completely act according to his own ideas. If something went wrong, it would be true that the higher you climb, the harder you fall.

After seeing off Lu Yizhong, Liu Xiang felt a little confused and went out for a walk. The courtyard was already bustling with activity. The soldiers of the National Army were cleaning up, and piles of rubbish were being cleared out from all over the place; the staff of the Planning Institute were inventorying the "useless" furniture and furnishings one by one and moving them to the prefectural treasury for temporary storage; the sanitation personnel were carrying large buckets of disinfectant, and several native workers were tearing open the packaging paper and hanging white wooden signs with black characters on the doors of the rooms one by one. Others were carrying office desks, chairs, and bunk beds and other furniture in from the outside. The originally solemn and almost suffocating prefectural yamen was like a beehive, bustling with activity, full of vitality and life.

The person in charge of this busy scene was Wang Sangou, the head of the general affairs section of the municipal office. He was wearing a new blue native uniform. He was already in his early sixties this year, which was considered a long life in the 17th century. After immigrating from Baitu Village, he changed his name: he changed "dog" to "gou" and was assigned to the general office to do miscellaneous work—he was born a slave, had a bitter past; and he had been a bachelor all his life, with no children and no worries. He was exactly the kind of person that the general office considered reliable.

After working in the general office for many years, Wang Sangou had always been single-minded and diligent. Compared to the days when he was a slave for the Lin family in Baitu Village, the general office was a paradise. He had no other thoughts. The general office was his home. The more he worked, the more energetic he became, and the younger he became. He, who was originally an illiterate person, also got a C-level diploma. This time, the Guangdong campaign required a large number of cadres. Although Wang Sangou was older, he was still promoted to be the deputy section chief of the general affairs section of the Guangzhou municipal government, specializing in general affairs. At this time, he was beaming with joy, shouting and waving his hands. Seeing Liu Xiang come out, he quickly went up to him and said, "Chief, I've been waiting for you for a long time!"

Liu Xiang was stunned, "What's the matter?"

"The unveiling of the sign!" Wang Sangou said happily. "Our Great Song Senate has recovered Guangzhou. There must be a ceremony for the unveiling of this sign."

Liu Xiang thought to himself, is there still an unveiling ceremony? Just as he was thinking, he was surrounded by Wang Sangou and others and came to the front of the yamen's eight-character wall. Many people had already gathered outside the yamen gate. The soldiers of the National Army and the native cadres were all beaming with joy. Outside the cordon, the citizens of Guangzhou had gathered. The fear brought by the change of sky overnight had disappeared under the peaceful takeover. Now, they were eager to see what this "long-admired" "Australian" and "髡贼" looked like.

Speaking of living Australians in the city, everyone only knew that Dongzhu Guo was one, but Dongzhu Guo looked no different from the wealthy merchants of the Great Ming. When Guangzhou was besieged, the bold ones slipped onto the city wall and looked at the "Great Song Navy" under the city. They only saw many soldiers in gray and blue clothes, but not a single "real 髡."

Seeing a man being surrounded by people coming out of the main gate, he probably was a real 髡. He was only in his thirties, with a dark complexion and a lean body. He was wearing a thick short jacket with a front opening, and the style was no different from the "fake 髡" around him, but the material was a little stiffer. Everyone couldn't help but be disappointed—the clothing system of the Great Song was really shabby.

How could Liu Xiang know the twists and turns in the minds of the onlookers? Wang Sangou wanted him to say a few words, but Liu Xiang was not prepared. Someone dragged over a packing box, and he stood on it, scanned the people in front of the main gate, and said loudly, "Comrades, all the citizens of Guangzhou! Today is the day of the establishment of the Guangzhou Special City Military Control Commission of our Senate. From today on, Guangzhou, this famous city of a thousand years, has returned to the hands of our Great Song and our Senate! We will work together to rebuild a prosperous, sanitary, and civilized new Guangzhou here, and use this as a starting point to rebuild the divine land!"

As soon as his voice fell, Wang Sangou lit a string of ten-thousand-character firecrackers. Amidst the crackling of the firecrackers, two native people hung the wooden sign of the "Guangzhou Special City Municipal Government" with white background and black characters on the main gate. The native people and the soldiers of the National Army clapped their hands together, especially those native people from Lingao, who were even more excited. Wang Sangou was so happy that he didn't know what to say. He remembered that he had been wandering all his life, without a wife or children, a lonely person. He was only taken in by the Senate in his old age, and from then on he experienced the taste of being a human being. At this moment, seeing the elder standing in front of the Guangzhou prefectural yamen and hanging up the sign, he was so excited that tears streamed down his face. He couldn't help but raise his arms and shout, "Long live the Senate!"

Following his shout, the native people and soldiers all shouted together, "Long live the Senate!" Countless rifles with fixed bayonets were raised high like a forest.

The shouts of "long live" were like a tide, spreading from the city center of Guangzhou in waves, beating against the entire city.

In a residence in the city, the tsunami-like slogans could also be faintly heard. Several men who were feasting stopped their wine cups and listened intently to the vague shouts. The courtyard was silent, as quiet as death.

The cheers and slogans disappeared into the air after a long time. A young man in his thirties sighed slightly, "I didn't expect it to be today! Even all the iron in the nine prefectures cannot cast this mistake!"

His voice was very painful. The people next to him couldn't help but feel sad.

Another person persuaded, "Young Master Liang, you don't have to blame yourself. The 髡贼 can have today, from the high officials in the court to the officials in Guangdong, I'm afraid they are all to blame..."

The person who said "the iron of the nine prefectures" was Liang Cunhou. This young juren from a gentry family had no intention of seeking fame and fortune. He stayed at home all year round under the pretext of taking care of his parents, living a low-key and secret luxurious life.

Liang Cunhou said, "That's what you say, but when the 髡贼 first came to Guangzhou, I was bewitched by them and even became their accomplice! Otherwise, how could they have gained a firm foothold in Guangzhou! And how could they have recruited so many refugees from Guangzhou and gathered them into an army!"

The person who was persuading him was Lin Zunxiu. He said, "Young Master Liang, the 髡贼 have the old thief Gao Ju to guide them, and Gao Ju has Eunuch Yang as his backer. Even if you saw through their true colors, what's the use? There are many people in the world who forget righteousness for profit!"

Liang Cunhou was silent and drank the wine in his cup silently. It was not like the Hundred Flowers Spring of Yangcheng, but like a cup of bitter wine.

At this time, Huang Bingkun on the side couldn't help but say, "The 髡贼 are not only the best at deceiving the world and gaining fame, but they are also used to confusing people's hearts and playing with the common people in the palm of their hands. I'm just afraid that it won't be long before this Guangzhou city, like Lingao, will no longer be the king's land of the Great Ming!"

Liang Cunhou said, "The 髡贼 have only entered Guangzhou. I don't know about the other prefectures and counties..."

Lin Zunxiu shook his head and said, "How many troops can the prefectures and counties have? The 髡贼 entered the city from the Great East Gate, and the guerrilla training camp outside the city didn't react at all. I think, I think..."

Everyone understood what he didn't say. Yesterday, there was not a single cannon shot or a single shout of killing in the whole of Guangzhou. When they woke up, the flag on the city wall had already changed. Needless to say, these government troops had already surrendered to the 髡贼.

"There is not a single man!" Liang Cunhou shook his head painfully.

"The 髡贼 have been operating in Guangzhou for a long time. This Grand World was built outside the Great East Gate, less than a quarter of an hour's journey from Dongguanxiang! The prestige of the previous invasion of the provincial river is still there. The government troops are afraid of the 髡贼's ships and cannons like tigers." Lin Zunxiu said, "Even if the government troops dare to fight, how many rounds can they last against them?"

Liang Cunhou fell into silence again. He realized that Lin Zunxiu's words were right. The fighting spirit of the government troops would not actually change the outcome of the fall of Guangzhou. In fact, from the battle of the provincial river, it could be seen that Guangzhou was just a ripe fruit, and the 髡贼 could eat it whenever they wanted.

"I wonder if Governor Xiong has noticed anything," Huang Bingkun said. "We should try to inform him to make preparations early."

"Governor Xiong, this person, likes to pacify the most. It's difficult to ask him to prepare for war, I think," Liang Cunhou said with some worry.

"Zhaoqing is a key point of the two provinces, and its terrain is dangerous. It has the advantage of the Little Three Gorges. If we can make preparations early, the 髡贼 may not be able to attack Zhaoqing. If Zhaoqing is not lost, then the west of Guangdong can be preserved, and there will be room for the situation to be saved in the future," Lin Zunxiu said eloquently. "There are also the troops of the Nan'ao deputy commander in the east of Guangdong. When the troops are strong and the provisions are sufficient, we can attack the 髡贼 from both the east and west."

"I am not talented, but I am willing to go to Zhaoqing to warn Governor Xiong!" Huang Bingkun said decisively.

It was meaningless for him to stay here. If he wanted to continue to live in humiliation under the rule of the 髡贼, then he could have stayed in Lingao. Why did he have to come here!
