"Then your stamina is really well-maintained."

"You make me sound so old. I'm only thirty!"

"Ah?"

"You look like this after working at the grassroots level for a long time." Yang Baogui's smile was very sunny. "Let's go together." He shouted, "Beibei, go! Drive Ukraine back!" Following his shout, a dog quickly ran out and drove back a large white pig that was trying to run to the side of the road to gnaw on tree bark.

"Its name is Beibei?"

"That's right. There are six in total, just right: 'Beibei', 'Jingjing', 'Huanhuan', 'Yingying', 'Nini'."

"What about the last one?" [Wu Nanhai][y009] was infected by his bad taste and was eager to know what the last one was called.

"It's called Aoyun (Olympics)." Yang Baogui said with a straight face, and then shouted again: "Aoyun!" A dog that had been walking quietly suddenly jumped up, ran to his feet, and circled happily. He patted its neck fur with satisfaction.

"You're really good at training dogs."

"It's my specialty, but not my profession. It's just for fun." Yang Baogui cracked his whip. "I can also drive a large cart. I learned it from the farmers in the countryside. It's just that there are no large carts here. I went to the industrial group and asked them to make a few large carts with rubber wheels. We could hitch them to the Dian horses we captured. A two-horse team could pull a thousand *jin* without a problem. But those guys kept whining that this kind of cart is backward and are busy trying to develop some four-wheeled horse-drawn farm cart. It's all nonsense. Can a small horse pull that kind of cart?"

"The Tieling draft horse could definitely pull it," [Wu Nanhai][y009] said, looking at the two particularly tall and strong heavy horses in the procession. This was the best draft horse bred in China since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. It had the blood of many of Europe's best draft and riding horses. Its maximum pulling force could reach 450 kilograms, and a single horse could pull a 1000-kilogram-load double-rubber-wheeled cart.

"It can pull, but these two have to be kept as stallions and are not suitable for much work. And the Tieling draft horse breed has actually degenerated quite a bit." [Note: The breeding of Tieling draft horses was stopped in the 1990s, and now only a very small number of degenerated stallions exist. The breed will soon disappear.] Yang Baogui sighed. "[Nanhai][y009], to be honest, I'm very worried about our agricultural group."

"Hmm, I also feel there are some problems, but there are so many things, I don't know where to start," he said, imitating Yang Baogui's manner, waving the willow branch in his hand to herd the animals.

"[Nanhai][y009], you studied agriculture. You should know the basis of high-yield modern agriculture, right?"

"Pesticides, fertilizers, improved seeds, water conservancy, genetically modified organisms, soil chemistry..." [Wu Nanhai][y009] said.

"Is it possible to replicate such a model here?"

"It's quite difficult. The conditions are too poor. Large-scale farmland water conservancy and the promotion of improved seeds are more realistic means of increasing production." [Wu Nanhai][y009] thought. "Fertilizer is not a big problem. It will be fine after the chemical group fiddles with the combined ammonia plant and the sulfuric acid plant. But pesticides are very difficult. This requires an organic chemical industry. I don't think it's possible without thirty or forty years of industrial development and accumulation."

"No," Yang Baogui shook his head. "These problems are still superficial. The biggest problem is that modern society is a system of great division of labor, and agriculture is no exception. And under such a division of labor system, the professional abilities of our agricultural technicians have actually degenerated—and so have the farmers."

"In the past, farmers had to select and breed their own seeds. Now they just buy them directly. Agricultural technicians actually only know what seeds to use, how to manage them after sowing, when to apply which pesticides, and what fertilizers to use..."

"Here, there are no seed companies, no pesticide factories, no veterinary drug factories, no agricultural machinery stations... We have to do everything ourselves. We were all trained under this system of great division of labor, and we only know our own part. Modern agriculture is a complete chain, and we only have a few scattered links."

He pointed to the pigs being herded by the dogs. "Take those pigs, for example—Georgia! Where are you going!" Yang Baogui shouted, using his whip to drive a pig back onto the road. "Everyone is counting on them to start a large-scale pig farming industry and live a life of eating meat at every meal, right? But no one knows how many vaccines a piglet in a modern pig farm has to be given from birth to slaughter, how much medicine it has to take, and how many drugs are needed just for disinfection in the pigsty. If a swine fever breaks out by accident, a large number will still die."

[Wu Nanhai][y009] became worried after hearing what he said. He had thought about these problems before, but never in such depth.

"It seems we have to rebuild everything one by one." He looked at the carefree pigs, grunting and looking for food as they walked. "Do they have names too?"

"Yes, they are all breeding boars and sows. Giving them names makes them easier to remember."

"What are their names?"

"Ukraine, Big Bobo (Poland), Georgia, E-luo-si (Russia)—"

"Haha, E-luo-si must be the boar, right?" [Wu Nanhai][y009] pointed to the fiercest and largest pig.

"No, that one is called the Soviet Union."

The two of them walked and talked. The ten-kilometer-long simple road was well-maintained. Except for the dust kicked up by passing cars, it was a leisurely walk herding the livestock. On one side was the surging Wenlan River. In the sparsely scattered fields on both banks, the rice was ripe, but there was no familiar scene of rolling waves of rice—the agriculture here was still quite backward. [Wu Nanhai][y009] walked along, feeling emotional, thinking about how to turn everyone's knowledge into productivity, but the difficulties ahead were numerous.

The road was peaceful. Although they occasionally saw some locals working in the fields, they were all far away. The several watchtowers along the road also gave the passing transmigrators a great sense of security. These originally crude wooden watchtowers had now been converted into three-story brick-and-stone blockhouses. Searchlights were installed on the roof, and below was an open space surrounded by a deep moat and barbed wire. In the event of an attack, pedestrians and vehicles on the road could quickly take shelter inside.

The entire marching column walked for nearly three hours before reaching the camp at Bairen Beach. All the members of the Agriculture Committee were waiting for them—today was the day the Agriculture Committee officially moved into its new location.

Unlike the departments that had already moved into the Executive Committee compound, the entire staff of the Agriculture Committee was located in what would later be called the "Nanhai Model Demonstration Farm." [Wu Nanhai][y009] had been taught in university that agriculture is not created by sitting in an office writing plans and making reports. It is created by every agricultural technician working steadfastly in the fields, fish ponds, and orchards, one step at a time. As an agricultural technician, one must live near the farmland.

The entire farmstead was built with red bricks newly produced by the brickyard. There was probably no more magnificent building complex in the entire Bairen City: offices, agricultural technology laboratories, warehouses, an agricultural machinery station, cellars, and neatly arranged granaries. By the river was a water-powered mill, and the newly built livestock pens exuded the fresh scent of logs. The only concrete structure was a row of hydraulic biogas digesters—to treat the various garbage, wastewater, and manure discharged from the living and agricultural areas. The biogas produced would supply the cafeteria for cooking. In the future, when there was more waste, the extra biogas produced could be used to generate electricity. The biogas slurry could be used as fertilizer or feed additive, and the final biogas residue was also an excellent fertilizer.

The construction plan originally included a permanent glass greenhouse, but the industrial department had not yet produced glass, so it was temporarily postponed. Fortunately, Hainan was in a subtropical climate anyway, and even during the Little Ice Age, the accumulated temperature was sufficient.

"The place allocated to us as an experimental field," Ye Yuming pointed to the marker that served as the land boundary, "extends from here to the water-powered mill by the river."

The distance from here to the river was more than 100 meters, and the length was also 200 meters. It was an irregular rectangle, which calculated to be more than twenty *mu* in modern area. It was no problem to use it as a vegetable garden and experimental field. A small part of this land had already been leveled and planted with some vegetables such as cabbage, green vegetables, green peppers, and tomatoes. At this time, some vegetables had already entered the harvesting period, and the cafeteria's menu could be slightly enriched.

However, most of the land was still more stones than soil, with many tree roots remaining. The land needed to be leveled, and some soil might need to be transported over. He observed the height of the river bank and the water level during the high-water season, estimating how many irrigation canals were needed and whether it was necessary to build flood control dikes and other water conservancy facilities. Where to plant fruit trees, dig fish ponds, and where to temporarily plant the tropical crop seedlings they had brought—all these had to be considered one by one.

The space of the entire Agriculture Committee building complex could not be wasted either. They could develop a courtyard economy. A grape arbor could be built over the walkway in the courtyard. A half-*mu* grape arbor could yield 1000 *jin* of grapes, without taking up land and providing shade. Some fruit trees could be planted behind the house...

He calculated in his mind, feeling pleased. But now there was a shortage of labor. He had to ask Wu De to send a few local farmers over to help with the work—it would be best to hire them directly as long-term laborers. As for the local agricultural situation, it would be best to find a landlord to ask, but he heard that the landlords and rich peasants had all been let go. What a pity. These people had rich experience in agricultural production and a better understanding of the social conditions in the countryside. But he couldn't speak the Lingao dialect and would need a translator, which was troublesome. It seemed he had to learn it himself. If nothing else, he would need to have some emotional communication when he took a wife and concubines in the future. Should he start with 'a, o, e'? But all this could wait until tomorrow. He was too tired after walking for several hours.

That day, he fell asleep in the office of the Agriculture Committee. After so many days, he finally had a roof over his head and could sleep in a room. He felt a sense of great happiness. It seemed that the feeling of happiness really depended on comparison.
