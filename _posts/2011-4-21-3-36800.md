The so-called Krav Maga fighting technique is a self-defense art originating from Israel. It is widely recognized in the West as a highly precise, street-fighting style self-protection technique used to resist street attacks, robberies, and sexual harassment, making it the best choice for self-defense.

It is a complete and extensive martial arts system, including self-defense techniques, counter-attack and kicking techniques, passive escape techniques, throwing techniques, ground fighting techniques, unarmed combat against knives, unarmed combat against sticks, unarmed combat against guns, and techniques against multiple attackers.

It organically combines the body's instincts with the practiced fighting techniques, supplemented by a series of training programs such as aggressiveness, fighting spirit, and situational awareness. It is technically aggressive. The only goal is to eliminate the threat from the opponent as quickly as possible, making it extremely practical.

One of the benefits of Krav Maga is that it can be used in various unfamiliar and unfavorable environments, such as at night, in narrow streets, or when sitting or sleeping, where hand and foot movements are difficult to perform, as well as in a state of exhaustion. It is very suitable for law enforcement officers and special agents.

After teaching the essentials of the movements, Xue Ziliang had the students practice. After the students became slightly proficient, he began to use practical simulation training. He often chose to teach at the end of the daily curriculum, when the students' physical strength had severely declined and their willpower was relatively lax.

The attacking side consisted of non-commissioned officers and first-class soldiers borrowed from the army. They were not only strong, but had also learned military-style boxing for more than half a year. They were not only powerful but also very aggressive.

The result of a group of well-rested soldiers against a group of physically and mentally exhausted students was self-evident. The student team was beaten all over the ground, and no one could last for more than a minute.

Seeing the moaning students all over the ground, Xue Ziliang knew that he had a long way to go. Many people's moves in the sparring between students were quite impressive, but in a real fight, let alone performing, even their reactions were half a beat slow.

"You guys still want to be special agents?" Xue Ziliang shouted. "All of you, get up within a minute."

During training, Xue Ziliang often had the students fight under great physical and mental pressure, using pressure to learn how to use their self-defense techniques.

The girls' squad received no special treatment in the fighting training—the enemy would not show mercy because you are a woman, nor would they engage in a fair duel. If a woman wants to do this job, she must first be able to protect herself.

When it was the female students' turn, laughter erupted from the army non-commissioned officers' ranks. Someone immediately said, "Let's not fight this one, right? It's too much of a bully."

But Xue Ziliang was unmoved and immediately called out, "Corporal Huang Ande! You're up!"

So the first match was Army Infantry Corporal Huang Ande versus Lu Cheng, the captain of the General Political Security Bureau's female student squad. Huang Ande was not a burly man. By modern standards, he had a very ordinary build: a height of only 172cm and a weight of 70kg. But for Lu Cheng, who was 155cm tall and weighed 40kg, he was a giant.

Huang Ande grinned embarrassedly, not knowing where to put his hands and feet, and kept stroking the stubble on his chin.

"What? You've become a fool after seeing a woman?" Xue Ziliang reprimanded. "Begin!"

Huang Ande seemed very embarrassed to strike, his movements were both light and slow. Xue Ziliang reprimanded, "If you don't fight seriously, I'll punish you by having you clean the latrines for a year!"

This punishment was very terrifying, so ten seconds later, Lu Cheng let out a scream, her body flew out, and she fell heavily on the soft mat, knocked out immediately.

Subsequently, Huang Ande knocked down all six members of the girls' squad in less than three minutes. Yao Yulan simply forgot everything she had learned and was knocked down in a daze. Yang Cao had learned some martial arts in the theater troupe and was more agile, but her martial arts skills were useless. She hit Huang Ande with a few punches, but he didn't seem to feel it at all. He just punched quickly and fiercely. Yang Cao parried left and right, feeling that her arms were about to be broken. After a stalemate of less than fifteen seconds, Huang Ande punched her in the abdomen. Yang Cao's face twisted in pain and she knelt on the ground, unable to get up for a long time.

Huang Ande was startled—he hadn't used much force! Just as he was about to bend down to check on her, Yang Cao suddenly swept her leg at his calf.

But the facts immediately proved that skills alone were useless. Huang Ande's body only swayed slightly—he was, after all, a soldier by trade, and his reaction was very fast. He immediately jumped back and escaped Yang Cao's attack range. After a full-force blow, Yang Cao was completely exhausted and really couldn't get up. Huang Ande hesitated for a moment. Should he continue to strike and completely knock down this cunning woman?

"Stop!" Xue Ziliang called a halt.

"Did you all see that?" Xue Ziliang pointed at Yang Cao, who was still struggling on the ground. "No matter what martial arts you have, without enough physical strength, it's useless! The punches and kicks that hit him are no different from dusting."

He looked at Yang Cao, who was struggling to get up—she was still clutching her stomach.

"Although you haven't learned Krav Maga yet, that kick you just made had a little bit of the right idea. Very good!"

"Continue practicing!" Xue Ziliang announced loudly. "If you want to cry, cry now. In the future, you won't even have the strength to cry—I will brutally train you bunch of trash until you can protect yourselves!"

So everyone was often beaten badly, and bruises all over their bodies were very common. Lu Cheng's arms were red and swollen every day, and she could hardly lift them. Massaging each other with medicinal wine became a daily required task for the students—the health department supplied a large amount of "Sanlitong Compound Tincture" prepared by Runshitang—this was a new type of external preparation developed by Liu San on the basis of Sanlitong powder. It was just right to use the students to test its efficacy.

While everyone was moaning and groaning every night, Yao Yulan received the first love letter of her life, written by Huang Ande. This letter, which was secretly stuffed into Yao Yulan's hand during training, with its crooked and typo-ridden handwriting, aroused her great contempt. She spat and threw it into the trash can. As a "city person," she naturally despised all people of refugee origin in her heart, not to mention that this soldier had beaten her severely on the training ground.

In the next day's fighting training class, Huang Ande was not arranged to spar with the girls' squad. He looked at Yao Yulan with hope, but was met with a cold stare. Huang Ande's hope immediately turned into a bubble. He had thought that his newly learned method of picking up girls was invincible. He turned his disappointment into infinite strength. All the students who fought against him that day were directly knocked out by him, which made Xue Ziliang wonder—when did this army non-commissioned officer become so fierce?

However, as their physical fitness gradually improved and their grasp of fighting techniques deepened, the fights between the students and soldiers gradually ceased to be like "getting beaten up." A few weeks later, soldiers began to be knocked down, and slowly more and more soldiers were knocked down. The soldiers no longer came to the training ground with smiles on their faces, and they fought more seriously.

The fighting training not only strengthened their physique but also gave the students more confidence to carry out tasks alone.

Another weapon that enhanced the students' confidence was the pistol.

While teaching fighting techniques, the students began formal light weapons shooting training, using the so-called "six-star repeating gun." Of course, this was not an S&W revolver, but a Lingao version of a revolver self-made by the machinery factory based on the creativity of the weapons design team.

As the administration deepened to the grassroots level and various administrative agencies continued to expand, the Transmigrator Group urgently needed to equip the growing number of native cadres, police, intelligence personnel, and security personnel with an effective self-defense weapon.

At present, the native cadres had no weapons. The police only had standard batons and bayonets, and only a small number were equipped with rifles, which was far from meeting the demand. Although the social order in Lingao had greatly improved after the suppression of bandits, no one could guarantee that there were no other hostile elements that had not yet emerged: Gou Er and his son were still at large, and the suppression of bandits, the takeover of the county yamen, and the clearing of farmland had inevitably touched the interests of some people. These people were afraid of the violent machinery of the Transmigrator Group and dared not take open hostile actions, but the possibility of them attacking and retaliating against the native collaborators of the transmigrator members was very high. The native cadres were the most reliable human resources of the transmigrator members. Once they were killed, it would not only be difficult to replace them in a short time, but it would also shake the confidence of the natives to serve the Transmigrator Group.

In the past, the machinery factory had manufactured some Derringer pistols for the transmigrator members who were active in enemy-occupied areas. The feedback was satisfactory, but everyone felt that the firepower of this kind of pistol was too poor, and the large-caliber pistol was too bulky. Since there was still controversy over whether it was necessary to manufacture this kind of gun, the machinery factory was not interested in mass-producing the Lingao version of the Derringer pistol.

Before the second general assembly was held, Wu De had instructed his subordinates to conduct a special investigation on this issue. The conclusion was that it was necessary to equip the cadres with weapons, especially the grassroots cadres. They had almost no self-protection ability in the face of hostile elements, and the nature of their work required them to often be active in the field, where they were easily attacked.

After Wu De became the director of the Planning院 (Yuan), he began to formally implement this plan. The plan was supported by Ma Qianzhan, and the General Staff also expressed its support for this plan—both the army and the navy lacked individual self-defense firearms. Native officers did not have pistols. They could use rifles in battle, but in daily life, they were unarmed—except for their sabers. Moreover, the Minie rifle, even the short-barreled version, was not suitable for equipping all soldiers: many special forces units in the army, such as artillery, engineers, logistics soldiers, and navy sailors, had very few opportunities to use rifles. Equipping them with rifles was both inconvenient to use and increased the cost.
