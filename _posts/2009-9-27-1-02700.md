The docks of Nanxiong Prefecture were crowded with boats of all sizes. It was the hub of water and land traffic between northern and southern Guangdong. Merchants traveling south would cross the Dayu Mountains from Nan'an, then take a boat from Nanxiong straight down to Guangzhou.

Little Eunuch Yang—Yang Tianliang—and his entourage occupied two multi-storied boats. One for him, his servants, and his maids; the other for his secretaries, managers, retainers, and guards. They displayed no flags or lanterns to announce their status. Eunuch Yang was out of favor at court, and to advertise their presence would only attract unwanted attention.

Yang Tianliang had been selected into the palace in the late Wanli reign and assigned to Eunuch Yang, who had adopted him as his godson. Eunuch Yang was a confidant of Gao Shiming, a Grand Eunuch who had wisely resigned when the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old came to power. Now, his adoptive father was a marginalized figure, and he himself had been without a proper assignment for years, relegated to the Sutra Printing Workshop.

The father and son rarely met. They managed their own properties and never spoke of court affairs, striving to avoid suspicion.

But the power of the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old was absolute, and their days grew more and more difficult. Last year, a movement had begun to build living shrines to Wei Zhongxian. Officials all over the country were clamoring to participate. Eunuch Yang, long out of favor, saw an opportunity.

No eunuch in the palace had yet taken the lead. What if he were to get involved? It could change his fortunes, or at the very least, leave a favorable impression.

But it was a risky move. He was not one of the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old's confidants. To do so would be to steal the limelight from others, a dangerous game. He decided to use the merchant class instead. He had a pawn in Guangzhou, Gao Ju, who had recently come into a great deal of money. He would have him take the lead.

And so, Yang Tianliang was sent to Guangzhou. The living shrine was to be grand, a testament to the "utmost sincerity" of the merchants. With Gao Ju at the helm, the local officials would not dare to refuse.

As for the cost, Eunuch Yang didn't care. Gao Ju had been under his protection for years. It was time for him to bleed a little.

But Yang Tianliang saw things differently. The Nine-Thousand-Year-Old was at the height of his power, a blazing fire. This small gesture would go unnoticed. But if he were to fall, this shrine would become an indelible mark of their association, an ironclad proof of their guilt.

The thought sent a shiver down his spine. He suspected there were agents of the Eastern Depot among his own entourage. Even thinking such thoughts was dangerous.

He leaned back, weary, and closed his eyes.

A young eunuch tiptoed in. "Master, Master Gao's manager has been waiting at the dock for a long time."

"Let him in."

The manager, Gao Ye, was a young, sociable man who often came to the capital to deliver gifts. He brought a boatload of food, wine, and other exquisite items, and a troupe of young actors for their entertainment.

The most peculiar item, however, was a small wooden box, a gift from Master Gao, he said, bought from the Australian merchants at a high price.

Yang Tianliang was familiar with the "Australian merchants." Gao Ju had written to him about them, about their strange and wonderful goods: crystal mirrors, lighters that sparked with a flick...

He opened the small, mother-of-pearl inlaid lacquer box. Inside were two small golden boxes, and a small, candlestick-like object. He looked at Gao Ye, who produced a paper box. Inside, a row of small white sticks was nestled in shiny silver paper. A fragrant smell wafted out.

"Is it tobacco?" Yang Tianliang, a smoker, recognized the scent.

"Paper-wrapped tobacco from Australia," Gao Ye said, presenting one to him.

It was snow-white, with light golden tobacco shreds at one end and a tightly packed, silk-floss-like filter at the other. He had never seen anything like it.

Gao Ye showed him how to light it. The tobacco was ordinary, the taste rather light, but the way it burned, glowing without falling apart, was truly strange.

"So pretentious, for a paper-wrapped cigarette," Yang Tianliang said, though he was quite taken with it. It would be a fine gift for the high officials at court.

"Manager Gao, are there more of these?"

"Yes, the sea merchants brought quite a lot."

"Good. When we get to Guangzhou, prepare a few dozen boxes for me, and that lighter must be included."

"I understand."

As Little Eunuch Yang's boat sailed down the river, the transmigrators sold another batch of goods. Cigarettes were a new addition. [Wen Desi][y002] took the opportunity to ask Master Gao to sell Gao Chang to them as well. They had considered various clandestine plans, but had decided to be open about it. Master Gao, thinking it was a request from Gao Qing, readily agreed.

Gao Chang arrived with his bedding. He asked to take the surname Wen, but the transmigrators, after some discussion, decided to restore his original surname instead. It was a gesture of respect, a way to win his loyalty.

The young man knelt, kowtowing, tears streaming down his face. "I am grateful for the masters' grace. From now on, I, Sun Chang, belong to the masters. Through water and fire, I will do whatever you command!"

"What if we were to return to Australia, and never come back?"

"Wherever the masters go, Sun Chang will follow, to the ends of the earth!"

They had thought it would be difficult to recruit a follower. Was it this easy? Their protagonist aura, it seemed, had finally emerged.
