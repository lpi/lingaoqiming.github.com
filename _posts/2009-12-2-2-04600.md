"Alright, let's take stock of our assets first," [Wu Nanhai][y009] proposed at the first general meeting of the Agriculture Committee.

The Agriculture Committee already had a ledger, but in the fifty-odd days since they had landed, the numbers and types of items had changed, and it needed to be revised.

In terms of seeds, they had 100 kilograms of hybrid rice seeds. This great weapon of transmigration was not as magical as legend had it. It was essentially a "mule" of the plant world; it had many advantages but could not reproduce. [Wu Nanhai][y009]'s purpose in bringing these seeds was to get a bumper harvest in the first year and stabilize the grain reserves. With grain, they had everything.

They had 50 kilograms of various other rice seeds each, for a total of 1000 kilograms, including high-yield, lodging-resistant varieties adapted to the local soil and water, such as Guangguichao and Shuanggui, which were widely planted in Lingao in the 1960s and 70s.

They had 100 kilograms of high-yield sweet potatoes, which were to be promoted in the future. Sweet potatoes should have already been planted in Hainan in 1628; these were high-quality seed potatoes. They also brought 100 kilograms of potatoes. The soil and water conditions in Lingao were not very suitable for growing potatoes, but this crop could be used as a vegetable, a staple food, and feed. It had great potential for promotion on the mainland in the future. There were also 20 kilograms of kudzu vine and 20 kilograms of high-quality alfalfa seeds.

They had 100 kilograms each of corn, wheat, and barley seeds, as well as 10 kilograms each of various beans: soybeans, mung beans, adzuki beans, black beans, and so on.

Vegetable seeds: 1 kilogram each of green peppers, tomatoes, cabbage, green vegetables, carrots, pumpkins, cucumbers, onions, various scallions, garlic, and so on.

Spices could be easily obtained in Southeast Asia through maritime trade at that time, so they only brought red chili and Sichuan pepper seeds, 10 varieties in total, for a total of 10 kilograms.

Before boarding the ship, he had also bought several large 1-kilogram bags of fruit seeds suitable for growing in Hainan.

Finally, he had not forgotten his little hobby of tobacco. 10 kilograms of tobacco seeds would give him a monopoly on the future tobacco industry. [Wu Nanhai][y009] was already planning to produce his own cigarettes once the tobacco was grown.

All the seeds were in official packaging and should have a shelf life of 2 years. Some varieties were not suitable for local planting and were prepared for more northern regions, so they chose vacuum-packed seeds that could be stored for 7-8 years.

"That's all for the seeds," Ye Yuming introduced. "There are also some seedlings that need to be transplanted to the nursery as soon as possible."

They had brought quite a few seedlings: 50 coconut saplings, 50 rubber tree saplings, 20 coffee tree saplings, 20 cocoa saplings, 20 coca plants, 50 cinchona plants, 5 poppy plants, as well as some timber trees, fast-growing trees, and fruit tree saplings, and sugarcane and banana stalks for cultivation. These plants were all very useful to them, but the difficulty of managing and planting them was not small. [Wu Nanhai][y009] remembered his tropical crops professor saying in class that when they specialized in cultivating cinchona seedlings at the educated youth farm in Yunnan, the germination rate was less than 5%. Cinchona seeds were said to be more expensive than gold. Quinine was a specific drug for malaria. Without it, the transmigrators' colonial plans to go north to Taiwan and south to Southeast Asia would all be in vain. Therefore, in addition to the seedlings, they also brought some seeds as a backup.

In terms of livestock and poultry, they currently had 6 pigs: two pairs of Landrace pigs and one pair of Northeast Folk pigs. The Landrace pig was a lean-meat type pig introduced from Denmark, used as the sire for crossbreeding. The Northeast Folk pig was a local breed from the Northeast region, which was resistant to rough feeding and had large litters, used as the dam for crossbreeding. Moreover, this pig had a particularly high fat deposition rate, which was convenient for obtaining animal fat. Now they also had 4 local piglets.

On the Agriculture Committee's list of horses and livestock, there was only one pair of Tieling draft horses. This type of horse was a relatively rare draft horse in ancient China. The two racehorses that Nick brought were not originally under their management, but after "Blue Lightning" died, the heartbroken Nick also put "Aranch" under the care of the Agriculture Committee. At first, [Wu Nanhai][y009] was very unhappy because Nick's various care requests were overwhelming: feeding it five times a day, giving it warm water to drink... until Yang Baogui said that this old racehorse still had some value—it was a mare.

"If it were a stallion, it would have been castrated when it began its racehorse training at two or three years old, and it would be useless now." Yang Baogui was quite satisfied with this horse.

"How old is it?"

"Thirteen or fourteen, I think," Yang Baogui flipped through his notebook. "I haven't checked their teeth yet. Horses can live to be thirty. This horse is not very good as a racehorse anymore, but it can still be used as a broodmare."

The 3 captured local horses, identified by Yang Baogui, were all Dian horses, about seven or eight years old, and 2 of them were geldings. These three horses could be used directly for labor.

"It would be best to get some more horses." [Wu Nanhai][y009] looked at the various small agricultural machinery that had been unloaded in the courtyard and had not yet been sorted out. They had small hand-held tractors, as well as large and medium-sized tractors that were currently being used by the engineering department, but in the long run, they still needed some draft animals. They had to enter the era of mule and horse power as soon as possible before the various resources for mechanization were exhausted, not only to meet their own needs but also the needs of farmers who adopted new farming methods.

"There are too many places where horses are needed, but Hainan is not suitable for raising horses." Yang Baogui shook his head. "The climate is a bit hot, and the rainy season is too humid. Horses are super delicate."

"How about breeding some mules?" Ye Yuming suggested. "Don't we have a pair of donkeys?"

"Please, I don't plan to go and help the donkeys mate right now..."

"Help the donkeys mate?" Ye Yuming looked confused. Even [Wu Nanhai][y009], who was usually a very serious and standard good man, laughed lewdly.

"That's right, and there's also pushing the buttocks!" [Wu Nanhai][y009] recalled the horse breeding lecture from his animal husbandry class back then. The course had made all the post-80s girls blush.

"What? You've done it too?" Yang Baogui asked [Wu Nanhai][y009] with a smile.

"No, I just took the class and watched a few pornographic videos for horses."

"Let's put the matter of breeding mules on hold for now. The breeding season for horses doesn't start until March. And these animals are very neurotic. They've been through a lot lately. Let them rest and fatten up first, and get used to the environment."

Besides these large animals, there were also some inconspicuous but very useful small animals: 2 pairs of rabbits (one for fur and one for meat), 4 roosters of different breeds (half for meat and half for eggs) and 20 hens, 2 pairs of ducks, 2 pairs of turkeys, and 10 homing pigeons—also Nick's private property. Finally, there was a calico cat brought by some girl, who seemed to have forgotten about it now. It still had a beautiful bow on its neck.

In addition to these living creatures, there were also some animals in a cellular state: a liquid nitrogen storage tank containing the sperm of goats, sheep, good breeds of beef cattle, and dairy cows. This tank was currently stored in the cold storage on the ship, but they had no liquid nitrogen production technology and had to find suitable local dams as soon as possible.

After taking stock of their property, the new farmers from the 21st century leveled the land and built simple poultry sheds. The free-range yard, paved with sand, was surrounded by a dense bamboo fence, on which they planted loofahs, hyacinth beans, and gourds. This not only provided shade for the chickens and ducks but also allowed them to harvest vegetables, killing two birds with one stone.

However, after a long journey, these chickens, ducks, and poultry looked obviously listless and had poor appetites. Constantly disturbing these animals was indeed a problem. They hoped that the vast open space and fresh air here would help them recover as soon as possible. The brothers were still waiting to eat eggs.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] set up a grape arbor in the walkway of the courtyard. Fruit trees were planted in the open space on both sides, and under the trees, several rows of garden plots were opened up, where various herbs and medicinal materials were planted.

"Are you going to turn the whole yard upside down!" Huang Dashan came over pushing his two-wheeled cart. He had just been transferred to the Agriculture Committee through the manpower group. His luggage was on the cart.

"Hehe, in a while, this place will be fragrant with flowers and fruits." [Wu Nanhai][y009] looked proudly at the messy frames made of bamboo poles and ropes. He glanced at the newcomer with thick glasses.

"You are?"

"I'm Huang Dashan. This is my transfer order." Huang Dashan pulled a small piece of paper from his pocket.

"Welcome, welcome!" [Wu Nanhai][y009] remembered that this person had applied to come to the Agriculture Committee several times. The reason for his application was that he was good at cultivating edible fungi and had brought many strains and culture media. "Are you in charge of fungal cultivation?"

"No," Huang Dashan smiled harmlessly. "My profession is a biochemical laboratory technician, and my specialty is in vivo cultivation of bacteria/viruses in animals. However, cultivating mushroom strains is purely a sideline to supplement my income."

"Then let's make your sideline your main business." [Wu Nanhai][y009] was very satisfied with this new combat power. "Where do you think your mushroom shed should be built?"

"It's fine to cultivate them under the fruit trees. Under the grape arbor is the most suitable place." Huang Dashan looked around. "Let's plant the easy-to-grow Pinggu mushrooms first. They are easy to grow and have a high yield. No need to build a shed. In the future, when conditions permit, we can build a few dedicated cultivation sheds. I've brought quite a few strains. But you have to give me a room for a laboratory. I've brought the common equipment for a biochemical laboratory." He then added, "It's best to have a relatively independent house, a little far from other living things..."

"Hmm?" [Wu Nanhai][y009] didn't understand what he meant, but he still nodded.

Yang Baogui was assigned a room as a veterinary clinic, plus a bedroom. He had been tirelessly hiding in his tent, carrying it in the prefabricated house. The large and small boxes he had painstakingly carried all the way finally had a safe place. Inside was a full set of animal medical equipment and reference books. [Wu Nanhai][y009] planned to clear out a room to store the agricultural books, planting manuals, and various instructional video discs they had brought, to serve as a dedicated agricultural technology library.
