"Xin Nachun is Xin Nari's younger sister. That girl is something else, a real firecracker. She even dares to slaughter pigs herself. Most of the young men in the village aren't good enough for her."

"I see," Liu Si said softly. "Tell me everything you know about the village, the people and their affairs."

"What do you need to know all this for?" the widow Zhou teased, her eyes full of charm. "Trying to curry favor with those two female officials again, are you? A grown man taking orders from two women. For shame!"

"They're my superiors, they pay my salary. Even an official has to kneel before the Empress Dowager. Besides, those two women are so tall and built like mares. How could your Brother Si possibly be interested—" Liu Si pulled the woman into his arms, his hands slipping under her clothes to roam freely. He whispered in her ear, "My dear, just tell your Brother Si everything about the village, and I'll make sure you're well taken care of tonight..."

Liu Si's "mixing public business with private affairs" had, ironically, made him the most informed member of the team. From the widow Zhou, he learned a great deal about the village, especially the recent movements of the bandits' families. This was critical information, and he didn't dare delay. That evening, after returning from the widow's house, he reported everything he had heard.

"It seems this gang of bandits isn't gone for good," Dong Weiwei said.

Du Wen gritted her teeth. "It looks like we need a severe crackdown!" She thought for a moment. "Are the ones causing trouble behind the scenes landlords or rich peasants?"

"Landlords? Rich peasants?" Liu Si was taken aback. He had learned the basics of social class division at the Peasant Movement Training Institute, but he hadn't expected such a question. He hesitated. "I don't think so—"

Dong Weiwei, annoyed by Du Wen's obsession with class origins, cut in. "Forget about landlords and poor peasants for a minute, let Liu Si report the important matters!" She turned to him. "What is the general attitude of the common people towards us now? The bandits' families are still so brazen, why is no one willing to organize a village militia for self-defense?"

"The villagers have three fears," Liu Si said. "First, they're afraid the work team will hold them accountable for 'collaborating with the bandits.'"

The Thirteen Villages area had been an old bandit stronghold. Few families were completely disconnected from them, having at least supplied them with grain or fodder, not to mention those who had joined in for a share of the loot. If an investigation were to be launched, almost everyone could be considered a "bandit collaborator," a crime for which they'd be lucky to escape with their lives.

"Second, they're afraid of retaliation if the bandits make a comeback. Some people who might want to get closer to us are afraid that if the work team leaves, the bandits will return. Their revenge is brutal. Many are still terrified by the memory of the massacre Dang Namen's gang committed in the village when he first rose to power—almost every family that had a feud with him had someone killed. Some were wiped out entirely, while others had to flee with their whole families."

"The third fear is of fighting," Liu Si summarized in his less-than-standard Mandarin. "They're afraid that if they form a militia, they'll be sent out to fight the bandits."

Dong Weiwei said, "I remember a few months ago when the security battalion was formed, the Thirteen Villages were supposed to provide men. I don't recall hearing about anyone here being afraid of a fight."

"They did send men. According to the villagers, Dang Namen said at the time that the 'transmigrators' were not to be trifled with, so they should just send a few men to satisfy the demand. Each village sent a few bachelors and outsiders."

"I can't believe they're so timid, afraid to fight bandits. What's the point of even having a militia then?" Du Wen was discouraged.

"You can't put it that way. They've been beaten and killed into submission by the bandits," said Dong Weiwei. "If they have three fears, our first step is to make them fearless. They can only act once they have courage."

"Until we capture Xin Nari and make a public example of him, the people in this village will never be at ease. Our plan to control the Thirteen Villages by establishing a militia will be impossible to achieve."

The news from the daily radio contact was not encouraging—Xin Nari had vanished without a trace. Not a single bandit suppression team had reported his capture or death.

Intelligence gathered by the other trainees was similar. It described the attitudes of various people, most of whom were indifferent. The few individuals the trainees had managed to win over only provided some basic information. In summary, beneath the village's calm surface, a fierce undercurrent was raging. The fall of Dang Namen's gang was like a stone tossed into a pond: the families of the killed bandits wanted revenge, and those who had suffered under the bandits also wanted to seize this opportunity to settle old scores. Hatred was fermenting in this small village. A violent storm was brewing, but Du Wen and Dong Weiwei had seriously underestimated the situation they were facing.

After Liu Si left, the two women began another round of arguments—this time over whether to arrest the bandits' families. Du Wen demanded their immediate arrest to "crush their arrogance." Dong Weiwei disagreed, arguing that arresting people based on a few sentences from Liu Si's investigation was too rash.

"Besides, do we arrest the whole family, or just the men? And what do we do with them after they're arrested?" Dong Weiwei retorted.

Du Wen had to admit she had a point. Arresting them was easy, but dealing with them afterward...

"We'll hold a public struggle session!" she finally exclaimed, pulling another tactic from her land reform playbook.

"That might not work," Dong Weiwei shook her head repeatedly. "It's easy for you to arrest all the bandits' families. But will the victims' families be willing to come forward and denounce them? Most people here are just bystanders, and they're still worried about the bandits at large. We might not be able to mobilize the people."

"What's your solution, then?"

"Let's just wait and see," Dong Weiwei couldn't come up with a brilliant plan either. "If we could capture Xin Nari and bring him here for a public trial, that would be ideal."

"That's the same as saying nothing!" Du Wen felt anxious.

"No matter what, we should get a clear picture of the situation first." Dong Weiwei's eyes lit up. "We can make use of the foreigner in the back."

"Use the foreigner for what?" Du Wen had a visceral dislike for the man.

"It's fine, we can use him for our own purposes," Dong Weiwei said. "The foreigner isn't one of us. Although no one listens to his sermons, he can move around more easily than we can. He could be very useful for gathering intelligence in the village and spreading some propaganda."

Although Du Wen felt it was unreliable, ever since the failure of the mass rally, she had begun to have some doubts about her own infallibility. So, she didn't insist. They immediately sent for Bai Duolu.

Bai Duolu came from the back with a long face. Since arriving in Daolu Village, he had become little more than Lu Ruohua's errand boy. Not only did he have to follow him around on his missionary work every day, but he also had to help print promotional materials. Before setting out, Lu Ruohua had asked him to write a few tracts, paid to have some woodblocks carved at Zhou Dongtian's printing shop, and painstakingly carried them all the way to the village.

When he was summoned to the second courtyard, his hands were covered in black ink, which he was trying to wipe off with a piece of paper. He felt a pang of sorrow because the pamphlets he had worked so hard to print had recently been appearing in various household uses around the village, including the latrines. The state of his missionary work was that a crowd would gather to snatch the pamphlets—though Bai Duolu knew full well they were illiterate and just wanted the paper. After listening to their plan, he pondered for a long while before saying, "This won't be easy. I feel that Father Lu is single-mindedly focused on preaching, and his efforts are not going well. I'm afraid he's in no mood to help us."

"Actually, missionary work is easy," Dong Weiwei had witnessed the power of underground churches during her time in the countryside. "He goes on all day about Jesus, redemption, original sin... who's going to listen to that? The key is to say: Believe in Christ and you won't get sick, the weather will be favorable, and you're guaranteed to have a son..."

Bai Duolu was shocked. "That's superstition..."

"And your stuff isn't superstition?" Du Wen scoffed.

"Religion and superstition are two different things," Bai Duolu tried to explain the difference.

"Alright, alright," Dong Weiwei said. "Do you really think you'll get any results by preaching like you're handing out flyers?"

Bai Duolu had to agree. Besides, this seemed to be the only way to make a breakthrough right now.

"Okay, I'll go talk to Father Lu." After saying this, he felt weighed down by sin—he wondered if he should go to confession to repent.

When Bai Duolu returned to his room, he saw Lu Ruohua still working hard under the oil lamp, writing something with a homemade quill. Probably another sermon.

"Father—" he interrupted the diligent Frenchman, "I have something to say about our missionary work..."

"What is it, my child?" Lu Ruohua replied with an expression of utmost humility.

"Shouldn't we... perhaps... change our method of preaching?"

"Oh," Father Lu was clearly interested in the topic. "You are finally willing to discuss this matter with me."

"Yes, Father," said Bai Duolu. "I have some thoughts."

"Please, speak, my child."

"The pamphlets and such, I don't think we need to print or distribute them anymore. Most people here are illiterate and can't understand them. No matter how many we print, they just end up as household paper... I believe, Father, you have seen this as well."

"Yes," Lu Ruohua nodded.

"You know, the people you are preaching to are Chinese. And I, too, am Chinese. So I know how Chinese people think," Bai Duolu said. "You see, the Chinese are, in essence, a practical people..."

Bai Duolu began to explain Dong Weiwei's ideas to him. In truth, these concepts were not entirely new to Bai Duolu. Although he didn't attend church or believers' gatherings often, he knew why many of his fellow believers had been baptized in the first place.

He spoke for a long time, while Lu Ruohua remained silent. Finally, he spoke: "My child, the Bible says..."

"Father," Bai Duolu said very humbly, "we are not debating matters of doctrine, but how to expand the Lord's flock. Isn't that the Church's purpose in coming here?"

Lu Ruohua nodded. "I understand your heart, my child." He then closed his eyes, seemingly lost in thought. Bai Duolu quietly slipped away.
