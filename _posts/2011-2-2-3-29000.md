Two or three bodyguards were transferred from Qiwei to act as guards. Like the clerks of the grain store, they were only responsible for their professional field and did not engage in intelligence work. Qiwei was, after all, only a joint venture. Although the Transmigration Group had effective control over its finances and management, its employees were still from the old society and had not undergone the "purification" treatment of the Transmigration Group. Their reliability was still slightly inferior.

However, the people from the bodyguard agency had sufficient professional spirit. It was more than enough for them to be responsible for security work. Lin Baiguang had always believed that intelligence personnel mainly relied on their brains and eyes to do things, not their fists.

Gao Di was quick-witted and eloquent. Lin Baiguang made him the "outside manager" of the grain store, which was equivalent to a modern business manager. Chen Tong was honest and reliable and served as the "inner house manager."

As for Lin Baiguang himself, he was the "owner." His identity was a merchant from Guangzhou who had opened a grain store here. All the necessary materials were provided by the Guangzhou Station.

To match his identity, with the approval of the Executive Committee, he was equipped with two "maids." These two girls were also from the intelligence training class. Their other task was to act as radio operators and telegraph operators.

"These are your staff, not your 'life secretaries'," Hu Qingbai joked to Lin Baiguang when handling the transfer procedures.

"Would I do such a boring thing?" Lin Baiguang sneered. Don't think that every man considers the needs of his genitals to be of paramount importance.

Hu Qingbai, however, did not understand his meaning and said, shaking his head, "Logically speaking, you are a merchant. It's not right for you not to have a wife at home..."

"You're wrong about that," Lin Baiguang said. "The people from the Great Library's historical materials group say that in ancient times, shopkeepers and owners never brought their families with them. No matter how big the boss was, his wife was always left at home, and he would only go back once every few years."

"If I were that rich, I wouldn't want to be a living widower. Isn't making money for enjoyment..."

Lin Baiguang did not respond to his words. In his view, Hu Qingbai did not understand that a career was a man's greatest excitement. What was the pleasure of playing with women? It was just a temporary pleasure.

After completing the procedures, he went to the General Political Security Bureau again to handle the handover—since he was now the station chief of the intelligence station, he had left the leadership of the Internal Affairs Committee in terms of the work system and was now under the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee. He had to temporarily resign from his job as the head of the enemy work department to avoid delaying the work. In addition, he had to participate in a small ceremony.

In the conference room of the General Political Security Bureau, all the staff attended, all wearing neat uniforms and armed belts. The General Political Security Bureau wore the Year One naval uniform, only with the collar tabs changed to blue.

"...To all departments: In recognition of Comrade Lin Baiguang's great contribution to enemy work, and to commend his advanced deeds, a special commendation is hereby issued... Chairman of the Executive Committee of the General Assembly of Transmigrators: Wen Desi. November, 1629."

After Ran Yao finished reading the commendation order, Lin Baiguang formally saluted and received it with both hands. A rather warm round of applause broke out in the conference room. It was the first time in the entire department that a chairman's commendation order had been awarded to an individual. Of course, given Lin Baiguang's achievements, this was not an exaggeration.

"It's a pity there are no medals. The method of first-class and second-class merits is too simple. I'm embarrassed to award them to native personnel, let alone to you. So I applied for a chairman's commendation order," Ran Yao apologized.

After the ceremony, Ran Yao and Lin Baiguang had a private conversation in the office and handed over the work of the enemy work department. Lin Baiguang requested to take part of the enemy work to the intelligence station to continue, including intelligence trips to Guangdong and the search for the families of Lin Dan and Xu Cheng, in order to continue to recruit the remnants of Zhu Cailao.

"This part of the work can be transferred to you," Ran Yao said. "I will coordinate with the Intelligence Committee and give you a separate radio call sign. You can continue to report to the General Political Security Bureau separately and request assistance."

"Thank you very much," Lin Baiguang said. He then briefed Ran Yao on the ideological trends of the recruited remnants of Zhu Cailao and the aspects to pay attention to—although this was no longer within his scope of responsibility, he had a good personal relationship with these people and had a large amount of first-hand information on their ideological trends. Now that he was leaving Lin'gao for a period of time, this aspect had to be explained to avoid no one taking over after he left.

He asked for a person. But this person was considered a "political prisoner." Although he was also doing hard labor in the labor reform camp, Dugu Qiuhun, who was in charge of the security forces and responsible for managing the labor reform affairs, had no jurisdiction over him—he could not be released without the approval of the General Political Security Bureau.

"Oh? Who do you want?"

"He Xin."

"That coward?" Ran Yao was very surprised. He knew of He Xin. Although he was a pirate, he was a typical dandy, a coward who had risen through the ranks by relying on a woman's connections. He had no special skills to speak of.

"He Xin is useless if he stays in Lin'gao. He might not even be qualified for hard labor. But in my hands, he will be very useful," Lin Baiguang said.

"Alright, he's yours," Ran Yao agreed.

Lin Baiguang's interest in He Xin came from the information he had gathered from casual chats with Shi Shisi and others.

"Speaking of He Xin, he is proficient in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, as well as all things romantic. He is good material for a pimp," Shi Shisi said, making fun of him. "He is a good hand at accompanying the big bosses in eating, drinking, and having fun. But he gets diarrhea as soon as a battle starts, and he is most afraid of the sound of cannons. He is not even willing to stay in the central army—the big boss sometimes has to go into battle himself. He spends all day messing around in the supply depot."

It turned out that He Xin was the son of a fishmonger in Fujian. After his parents died, he had no interest in running the family business. In a few years, he had squandered his family's fortune on eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. With nowhere to go, he had to seek refuge with his cousin.

Relying on his eloquence and his skills in eating, drinking, and having fun, he had also made a small name for himself in the Zhu Cailao group. In fact, he was just a kind of hanger-on and pimp for the bosses.

Since this person was material for a pimp and hanger-on, he would be useful to him. Lin Baiguang's grand ambition was to penetrate deep into the society of the Great Ming. Of course, penetrating deep into the society of the Great Ming did not mean penetrating into the common people of the Great Ming, but to connect with the rich merchants, officials, and other figures of this time. Lin Baiguang was confident that he had enough skill in dealing with people and handling social situations. However, he was not yet familiar with the corrupt practices of this time. Since He Xin was proficient in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, he would be a good assistant.

He then subtly and indirectly inquired about He Xin's affairs. Shi Shisi and the others did not particularly dislike this "pretty boy." Although this person was a pimp who had risen through the ranks by relying on a woman's connections, he was not a difficult or cunning person.

Since he was not a cunning person, it would be easy to handle. Lin Baiguang thought, as long as He Xin's heart was not bad, he might as well try to win him over.

He immediately issued a release certificate. Lin Baiguang instructed Gao Di, who had returned to Lin'gao with him to handle matters, to first prepare a single room in the detention camp in Bopu, with clothes and personal items.

He himself took the public ox-cart to Nanbao and went to the Nanbao labor reform camp.

Since the opening of the mine in Nanbao, the labor reform team originally located at the Bairen quarry had been moved to Nanbao—it was no longer appropriate to keep it near the central hub of the Transmigration Group, and it was also unsafe to blast and quarry stone in a densely populated and built-up area like Bairen Beach.

Lin Baiguang passed through the drawbridge over the moat. The bottom of the deep moat was planted with dried bamboo spears. Behind the moat was a barbed wire fence, surrounding twenty or thirty long brick and wood houses. Wooden watchtowers stood around.

In the open space in the middle of the barbed wire fence stood a wooden platform that looked chilling. On it were strange-shaped racks with iron shackles hanging from them. Lin Baiguang thought that this was undoubtedly a torture instrument. No wonder the natives were terrified at the mention of this place. Obviously, "human rights" were not respected here.

When Fu Youdi heard that a chief had come, he hurried out to greet him.

"I want He Xin. Bring him out immediately. I'm taking him away."

Fu Youdi said with difficulty, "Sir! This person is a serious criminal with an 'indefinite term.' Except for the sick, all the serious criminals are working in the quarry right now. Could you wait until they finish work in the evening, and I'll send someone to bring him to you..."

"I want to take him now," Lin Baiguang said.

"Then I'll have to trouble you to go to the quarry with me."

The labor reform team's quarry was located on a small hillside not far from the camp. This was a quarry exclusively for the labor reform team. There were watchtowers for surveillance and a cordon of armed soldiers. Three or four hundred prisoners were on the hillside, collecting and transporting the rubble from the blasting. To maintain hygiene and for easy identification, their hair and beards were all shaved clean. They were working almost naked, with only some cloth scraps on their bodies, not to cover their shame, but to protect their bodies from being scratched by the stones.

Each team of prisoners had a foreman-like person, with a colored flag with a number tucked into his waist, and a rattan whip in his hand to supervise the work.

This scene reminded Lin Baiguang of the movie *Spartacus*. Wasn't this just naked slave labor?

"Are there female prisoners here?"

"No, women are a rare commodity in Lin'gao. How could they be wasted here?" Fu Youdi said that there was another work site for female prisoners. They were engaged in spinning, cotton processing, and tanning. Nanbao was a window for trade with the Li areas, and kapok, cotton, rattan, hemp, and leather were continuously transported out from the Li areas. The Ministry of Light Industry had set up a primary processing plant here, using prisoner labor.

"Bring prisoner 16280505130080," Fu Youdi ordered. His men immediately went down to the work site, and in a short while, they brought up a prisoner who was covered in dust and naked.

"Are you He Xin?" Lin Baiguang looked him over. Besides his dark and rough skin, he looked healthy and not as tortured as he had imagined. His face was just covered in dust and grime.
