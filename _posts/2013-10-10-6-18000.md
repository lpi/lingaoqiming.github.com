After seeing Gou Chengxuan off, Hao Yuan was tidying up the things on his desk when the straw curtain was lifted and the girl from next door came in againâ€”bringing tonight's dinner.

Hao Yuan lived alone and naturally didn't cook for himself. Fortunately, the girl's family next door ran a small food stall, so fire and water were readily available. He had arranged for them to provide his meals, three times a day, which was a small luxury.

The girl smiled, "Uncle Hao is busy with his great cause again. Eat first."

She placed the tray on the table. It contained two bowls of dishes and a small rice bucket, all steaming hot.

The dishes were a bowl of vegetables and a salted shrimp, likely caught from the Qiantang River.

Although Hao Yuan was frugal and diligent, he was not overly harsh on himself when it came to food. He had one rice and one dish per meal, with some seafood added every few days. This was considered a rather good meal in Nanxiawa.

"What great cause do I have?" Hao Yuan laughed.

"Don't you lie to me. Do you really think I'm a child?" The girl's scalp, shaved to treat ringworm, now had short stubble, though it was short and sparse in some places.

"I've never treated you like a child," Hao Yuan smiled and sat down. The girl opened the rice bucket and served him a full bowl of rice.

"Uncle Hao, my mother said, maybe you should give us less rice each day. You leave half of it every meal," the girl said.

"It's not being wasted."

"It's precisely because it's not wasted that my mother wants you to give less rice. You're paying us to cook for you. If we then take advantage of your leftovers, how can that be right?"

"Isn't it natural for the one providing the meals to take that advantage?" Hao Yuan said, eating his meal.

"Taking advantage of you makes my whole family uneasy," the girl said. "In this Nanxiawa, everyone benefits from your kindness. If our family takes advantage of you too, we'll be struck by lightning."

"Such harsh words." Hao Yuan smiled, picked up a shrimp, and put it in his mouth. "Your mother really has a special skill with fish and shrimp!"

"Just a common household skill." The little girl rested her chin on her hands, watching Hao Yuan eat voraciously. "Uncle Hao, you really don't seem like a young master from a rich family..."

"When did Uncle Hao ever say he was a young master from a rich family?"

"Never mind that. You said you'd give me a new name."

The little girl, like all poor girls of that time, had no formal given name. Her family name was Jia, and she was the third child, so she was usually called Sanniang. Hao Yuan had recently been giving school names to the children who studied with him.

"You shall be called Jia Le," Hao Yuan said. "Changle is the ancestral home of your Jia family. You take the character 'Le' (joy), for happiness and joy." As he spoke, he dipped his finger in the water from his teacup and wrote the two characters "Jia Le" on the tabletop.

"That's wonderful! Thank you, Uncle Hao!" Jia Le clapped her hands with joy. She tilted her head and looked at the two characters on the table. "These two characters are so unfamiliar..."

"Practice them ten times a day, and after a month, they won't be unfamiliar anymore."

"Okay! I will definitely practice my name well!"

"The matter Uncle Hao discussed with you last time, did your parents agree?"

"I was just about to tell you: my parents have no objections. Our whole family's lives were saved by you, Uncle Hao. Now that you're asking me to do this small thing, I will definitely do my best. Besides, after I get in, I'll get free meals and even get paid. I heard the pay and rations at the villa are very good."

"Hehe, that's true," Hao Yuan paused his chopsticks. "But the villa is no paradise. After you get in, never mind the risks, your daily life will be like being in prison. You'll be punished for the slightest mistake, and you'll often be beaten and disciplined."

"I'm not afraid of that. I'm not that precious. I don't care about being beaten or scolded. We're not living in luxury out here either. Besides, this is for you, Uncle Hao."

Hao Yuan laughed. Jia Le probably realized her words were inappropriate, and her face flushed red. She said shyly, "I know, Uncle Hao told me, this isn't for anyone in particular, it's for everyone."

"That's right," Hao Yuan said. "I know you and your parents agreed to go because you're grateful to me. But do you remember what I told you?"

"I remember," Jia Le thought for a moment. "Don't focus on personal gratitude or grudges. We must work for the poor and stand up for the poor."

"Since you're going to the villa, I might as well tell you plainly. This time, you're not just doing a task for Uncle Hao; you're standing up for the people of Hangzhou, for everyone in Nanxiawa. Do you remember what Uncle Hao told you about why the Zeng Aqing family who lived behind us committed suicide?"

"I remember." Jia Le's expression turned solemn, and her eyes reddened slightly. After the incident, she had gone to see the commotion. When she saw the little boy from the Zeng family, who used to follow her around calling her "sister," being carried out, she ran home and cried her eyes out. "Because the price of silk fell. It was all Master Zhao's doing."

"Master Zhao, for his own selfish gain, did not hesitate to harm thousands of people. There was only one Zeng Aqing in Nanxiawa, but outside of Nanxiawa, who knows how many families have been ruined," Hao Yuan said sternly. "We must seek justice for them."

"Uncle Hao, I understand!" Jia Le nodded solemnly. "I will do whatever you ask me to do. Even though I'm a girl, I will not falter when it matters most."

"Right now, I don't need you to do anything. You just need to get inside the Phoenix Villa first. As for what comes next, I will send someone to tell you." He stood up, walked to the door, listened for a moment, then returned to the table and lowered his voice. "Listen carefully..."

Since being beaten, Xihua was unable to move easily and could only rest in bed. The next day, several people came to visit her, some who were close to her, and others like Yanhe who came out of classmate camaraderie. Following Zhao Yigong's instructions, Xihua maintained a wooden expression, said little, and acted heartbroken. Those who came to visit her knew she was proud and arrogant, so they didn't mind.

Huang Xiang came to see her on the evening of the second day. Her status was humble, so she didn't dare to be the first. Seeing Xihua lying in bed, tears welled up in her eyes. She placed the basket she had brought on the table.

"Miss Xihua, you have suffered," she said, and perhaps touched by her own feelings, tears streamed down her face uncontrollably, and she couldn't say another word.

"It's Sister-in-law Huang, please sit." Xihua had seen only familiar faces all day, but none of them had revealed anything. She was getting anxious. Seeing someone she wasn't particularly close to finally arrive, her spirits lifted. She took her tasks very seriously. Although the medicine from yesterday had eased her pain, she now put on an act of unbearable suffering.

"Yesterday, I implicated you, causing you to lose a month's pay and rations..."

"Please don't say that." Huang Xiang wiped her tears. "The suffering we endure in the filature is the worst in the villa. Besides you, Miss Xihua, no other person of standing has spoken up for us. For that alone, never mind losing a month's pay, I would willingly take those sixty strokes of the cane for you."

She wiped the corners of her eyes with her sleeve and took out a few items from the basket. "This is from the female workers in our factory. We all chipped in. It's not much; we couldn't afford anything good."

"I know you all have heavy family burdens and only went to the filature for the high monthly wages. How can I accept your things? I absolutely cannot."

"If you don't accept, we'll feel even more guilty," Huang Xiang said. "Yesterday, Butler Cai already announced that the factory will switch to three shifts, with each shift being two shichen shorter. Everyone says it was you, Miss Xihua, who risked your life to get this for us. You are our benefactor..."

She rambled on with many words of gratitude, but Xihua's feelings were very complex. She had spoken up for the filature workers out of a moment of indignation and had not expected them to be so moved to tears of gratitude.

Although she repeatedly declined, she couldn't overcome Huang Xiang's persistence and had to accept the items.

Seeing that she had accepted the items, Huang Xiang finally brought up her request. She said she had a distant relative locally who was having a hard time and wanted to send her daughter to work in the villa. Because the child was young and they were unwilling to sell her into permanent servitude, according to the villa's rules, those who came to work without selling themselves were considered hired laborers and could only be menial servants in the Cihuitang, running errands. So she wanted to ask Xihua for a favor, to get the girl into a place where she could learn something.

Xihua's heart skipped a beat. Could this Huang Xiang be the spy?!

Her expression changed slightly, and Huang Xiang noticed. She forced a smile. "I know this is difficult to arrange..."

"It's not difficult." Xihua had already figured it out. Right now, anyone could be the spy. Only by letting things take their course could she expose the fox's tail. She gave a bitter smile. "Sister-in-law Huang, I am still under punishment myself. I don't know how the Master will deal with me after I recover. If I still have my old post, then have the girl transferred to my side as a servant in the school. Following me, she can at least learn to read a few characters and some needlework."

Huang Xiang was overjoyed and curtsied. "The Master treats you exceptionally well! Once you've recovered, things will surely go back to how they were."

Xihua asked, "What's the girl's name?"

"To answer the young miss: her surname is Jia, and she's the third child. You can just call her Little Sanniang."

Huang Xiang returned to her dormitory quarters. She had a husband, so she was assigned a private room in the villa. In the room, a woman was waiting for her. The woman's name was Wang Rong'er, a servant woman in the villa.

"Sister-in-law Huang, how did it go?" she asked anxiously when she saw Huang Xiang.

"It's all settled." Huang Xiang picked up the clay teapot on the table, poured a full bowl of coarse tea, and gulped it down. "Miss Xihua has agreed to transfer your niece to her school."

"Thank you so much!" Wang Rong'er's face lit up with joy. She curtsied several times, took out a few circulation coupons from her waist, and stuffed them into Huang Xiang's hand. "Sister-in-law Huang, you are so capable."

"It's all thanks to Miss Xihua's blessing!" Huang Xiang "graciously accepted" the coupons. She thought that although she had lost a month's pay, in the end, the Master had reduced the working hours at the filature, and Miss Xihua now saw her in a new light. It was truly a blessing in disguise.
