Even in modern times, with large-scale mechanized production, salt drying is still a very labor-intensive and extremely arduous job. It's far from just digging some condensation and evaporation ponds on the beach to produce salt in batches. The ancients knew long ago that seawater accumulated on shore reefs could evaporate to form small amounts of salt, but until the Yuan Dynasty, boiling seawater was still the most widespread method of salt production. Solar salt production is not as simple as it seems—applying the theory to production practice requires a systematic process flow. [Wang Luobin][y003] had seen salt production in the countryside of Guangxi. The process involves guiding seawater from outside the dam through a tidal channel into a storage ditch inside the dam. Mechanical power is used to move the water from high to low, through main and branch channels into evaporation ponds. When the brine reaches 5-10 degrees (Baumé), it is moved to a brine-drying pond and further concentrated to 20-25 degrees. It is then collected by a brine channel back to the brine machine room, lifted by power to a brine pool, and then injected into the crystallization pond. The brine depth is 6-8 cm, and the concentration must be maintained at 26-28 degrees to produce salt.

In ancient times, it was obviously impossible to have such production conditions. He was very interested in how they increased the concentration of the brine under primitive conditions.

The village chief took him and Xiong Buyou to the dike. Below the dike was a large area of stone salt-drying troughs shaped like inkstones. The placement of these troughs was very particular. They seemed to be stacked randomly, but were actually arranged at different heights in a well-ordered manner to make full use of the sunlight. The center, surrounded by the troughs, was a patch of black salt fields. The village chief said that there were now more than 7,000 salt troughs in the village, all carved and polished by their ancestors and passed down through generations.

The salt field was a type of muddy tidal flat, which they called "salt mud." During the dry season when the sun was strong, the spring tides would flood this salt mud twice a month. The salt mud had the effect of absorbing salt from the seawater. When the seawater receded, the salt mud was loosened with a rake and then dried in the sun for a few days to evaporate the water, leaving the mud with a very high salt content.

The salt mud was then put into a salt pond, a completely manual process: the dried mud was raked into the salt pond with a wooden board. The so-called salt pond was a pool 2 meters wide, 3 meters long, and 1 meter deep dug in the salt field, with bamboo strips and thatch at the bottom to act as a filter.

After the salt mud was in the pond, the salt workers needed to stomp it firm and then pour in seawater. The filtered water flowed from a small opening on the side of the salt pond into a brine pond, creating a pool of brine.

How was the concentration of the brine judged? The salt workers would break off the stem of a plant called *Huangyuchi* that grew by the salt fields and put it into the brine pond. Only when the stem floated on the surface was the brine truly saturated; otherwise, it needed to be repeatedly exposed to the sun.

The brine was then carried to the salt troughs. The troughs were made of volcanic stone. [Wang Luobin][y003] looked closely and saw fine, dense pores in the stone. Perhaps they served a water-permeable function? The brine was poured into the troughs before sunrise. After a full day of exposure, the salt could be scraped up with a board at dusk and collected in bamboo baskets. In the hottest and sunniest seasons, a single trough could evaporate two or three fillings of brine.

At this time, most of the salt troughs were empty, but some still had salt crystals that had formed, sparkling brilliantly in the sun, a beautiful sight.

[Wang Luobin][y003] looked at the more than seven thousand salt troughs. Using such a primitive method of labor, this place could produce more than 200 tons of salt a year. He couldn't help but marvel at the infinite wisdom of the ancient people.

There was a shed on the dike for storing tools. Curious about ancient salt field tools, [Wang Luobin][y003] went in to have a look. Inside were many tools, not much different in appearance from what he had seen in saltworks in the past. He tried the rake for tilling the ground and found it to be much heavier than modern products. In ancient times, with limited processing capabilities, they could only use the clumsiest methods to manufacture things. It was truly hard work to drag such heavy tools under the scorching summer sun.

He approached a salt-drying trough. A layer of white salt had already crystallized inside, translucent and beautiful, and very fine. It looked very much like the refined salt produced by modern salt factories. This greatly exceeded his expectations. He had never seen sea salt reach this level of quality without a refining process. He touched some with his finger and put it in his mouth. It was much milder than the fine salt they had brought and melted instantly.

He didn't know what the sodium chloride content was. There was no equipment here for analysis. But [Wang Luobin][y003] knew that with this salt's appearance, there would be no shortage of buyers.

But that this place was so impoverished was truly unexpected. The working people of ancient times really lived in dire straits.

As he was lamenting, he suddenly saw a group of people walking towards the dike. The leader was on horseback—a rare sight locally—followed by a large group of men in blue clothes. When Village Chief Tan saw them, a look of both fear and disgust appeared on his face. He turned to [Wang Luobin][y003] and said, "It's Landlord Gou."

"Landlord Gou?" [Wang Luobin][y003] vaguely remembered the name but had forgotten where he had heard it.

"Yes, yes." Village Chief Tan seemed to fear the landlord's power and didn't even have time to say another word to him. He hurried forward to greet them, bowing with his hands clasped, his back bent, his attitude extremely respectful.

[Wang Luobin][y003] didn't know who this Landlord Gou was, but from the village chief's respectful and fearful demeanor, this person was definitely not a good sort, most likely a local tyrant. They were currently weak and it was difficult to deal with such a person directly, so he just watched from the dike.

He saw the man on horseback scolding repeatedly, while Village Chief Tan bowed and scraped, seemingly begging for something. After this silent drama played out for a while, Village Chief Tan dejectedly led his people back to the village, leaving them on the dike without a word. [Wang Luobin][y003] quickly informed the people still moving salt in the village via walkie-talkie to be on alert.

However, the newcomers apparently did not dare to provoke them. The prowess of the short-clothed, shaved-headed sea pirates was now known to women and children throughout Lingao. After a while, the village chief returned to the dike, looking worried, and led them back to the village.

Xiong Buyou inquired for a long time before he finally understood the whole story. It turned out that according to government regulations, the saltworks paid its taxes in silver equivalent. That is, the salt workers did not need to directly hand over a quota of salt to the government, but rather converted the salt into rice or silver. The old rule was that one *yin* of salt was equivalent to one *shi* of rice. Later, the rice equivalent was changed to a silver equivalent: the salt was first converted to rice, and then the rice price was used to convert it to silver. The salt quota for the Ma'niao saltworks was "one thousand four hundred and seventeen *yin* and two hundred and thirty *jin*," which was over one thousand four hundred *shi* of rice equivalent. In terms of silver, at the market rates of the Tianqi and Chongzhen eras, this amounted to nearly two thousand taels.

Paying the salt tax in silver equivalent had some benefits for the salt workers: production was no longer under government supervision and control. As long as the salt tax was paid on time, they could basically do whatever they wanted and no longer had to dedicate themselves day and night to the Ming Dynasty's salt industry. After producing the salt, merchants would naturally come to buy it. If they produced a lot of salt and the market was good, they could live quite well. Some found salt drying too hard and used income from business or land reclamation to pay the salt tax.

But after the earthquake, everything changed. Landlord Gou's father took advantage of the fact that the village's salt fields were destroyed and they couldn't pay the salt tax on time. By providing loans and paying the tax on their behalf, he gradually gained control over most of the salt sales. But his purchase price was much lower than the market rate. The salt the workers toiled to produce was not even enough to pay off this vicious cycle of debt. He also colluded with the government, monopolizing the salt tax, and insisted that due to the high price of rice, the silver equivalent for each *shi* of rice was three taels of silver. The high-interest loans on one side couldn't be paid off, and the official tax on the other side was deeply in arrears. The salt workers knew he was playing tricks, but they had to beg him to intercede with the government on their behalf. Over time, the Gou family became the de facto rulers of the village. The salt fields seemed to have become the Gou family's private property. Exploitation grew heavier, and in recent years, whenever sea pirates came to Lingao, they would always rob the salt vouchers from the saltworks and kill many people. The village became more and more dilapidated. The able-bodied men dared not return home and gathered in some inland areas to reclaim land and farm for a living.

As for his purpose in coming just now, it was to press for this month's "regulation silver" and to tell him to call all the young men back to dry salt, otherwise he would have all the women, children, and elderly in the village arrested and thrown in jail.

"Jail?" [Wang Luobin][y003] asked. "Is he an official?"

"Not at all. It's his family's private jail," Village Chief Tan said with a shudder. "The Gou family is formidable. Never mind a private jail, if anyone offends them, they can be captured and tortured to death—"

He quickly shut his mouth, probably feeling he had said too much, and just urged them to transport the salt and leave quickly. [Wang Luobin][y003] felt that the matter of the salt village was a complex problem. The issues involved here might really require a land reform work team to handle.

To get guidance from the Executive Committee, he returned to Bairen City that night. Although some committee members were not in the city, the remaining members discussed the matter and approved the work team approach he proposed: send a capable team to station at the saltworks, help the local villagers restore production, and arm the salt workers to get rid of the threat of local tyrants and pirates, making the Ma'niao saltworks an important salt and chemical raw material base for the transmigrators.

Because this was the first time the transmigrators were truly carrying out a comprehensive social transformation of a place, all the groups attached great importance to this matter and drew personnel to form a saltworks work team.

Originally, the Executive Committee had planned to appoint [Wang Luobin][y003] as the team leader, but Engineer [Wang][y003] believed that this position should be held by someone who was both militarily competent and had strong social skills. In the end, it was decided that Xi Yazhou would take the role.

Du Wen was in charge of propaganda and organization work. Since landing, she hadn't had any real work to do besides reading radio scripts that no one listened to every day. When she heard they were going to do "land reform," she immediately became excited and volunteered to participate. The entire work team consisted of thirty people, including a doctor—He Ma.

Everyone carried sufficient weapons: pistols, rifles, daggers, and a large amount of ammunition. He Ma brought many medicines and simple surgical instruments. Considering that they might be stationed there for a long time, the work team also brought a wind turbine and other equipment. The food issue was more troublesome—besides feeding themselves, they might also have to provide relief to the local people. Although [Xiao Zishan][y001] had already taken people to Guangzhou for a major procurement, it would be some time before the first batch of grain arrived. [Wu Nanhai][y009] didn't dare to give too much, so he first allocated a week's worth of grain and non-staple foods.
