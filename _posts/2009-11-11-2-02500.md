After finishing his seafood rice, Wu De filled his thermos with water, put on his gear, and went on with his guard duty. Today's mission location was Section 3 of the road construction site. When he heard the mission assignment last night, he knew that the leaders of the Executive Committee would be coming to the construction site to work today, so the number of guards was doubled. It was said that this was a new measure to implement the spirit of the Executive Committee's document "everyone participates in labor to avoid cadre specialization."

Without much effort, he found the cadres' work location—it was hard not to find it, because Ding Ding, that omnipresent fellow, had already climbed onto a bulldozer, directing everyone to pose on one hand, and shouting for his foreign girlfriend to take pictures on the other. [Ma Qianzhu][y005] and a few other executive committee members, with stiff smiles, held folding entrenching tools and pretended to be digging.

Damn, this scene is so familiar.

After the reporters dispersed, the executive committee members were still busy digging and transporting earth. They didn't immediately get in the car and leave, nor did they do things like shaking hands and comforting the model workers. It seemed that Little Ding's business was not yet proficient enough.

"Hey, who are you digging a pit to bury?" Wu De walked over and teased.

"Of course, to bury an idler like you. I'm building a road," Old Ma replied irritably.

"Building a road? Why do I see you digging a pit?"

"Digging a pit? I have a strong sense of public morality, unlike some people." [Ma Qianzhu][y005] swung his shovel and shouted at Ye Mengyan, who was also working over there, "What are you doing? We are taking earth, why are you digging such a deep pit? You're going to hurt someone!"

"Haha... Oh, by the way, the thing in your hand is for fooling those kids who have never done farm work in their previous lives. I have a two-pronged mountain hoe here. Just put a handle on it and it's good to use. That's what's for work." Wu De stopped joking and pointed at the shovel in Old Ma's hand.

"Why don't you go get it? You have no foresight..." [Ma Qianzhu][y005] stopped his work and raised his shovel in a mock-chopping motion.

So Wu De went back to the shed and took out all the hoes, shovels, picks, bamboo knives, and axes—these were all tools he had brought with him, and he was used to using them. He selected a few suitable tree branches, fitted handles to the tools, drove in wooden wedges, and knocked them firmly on a tree stump. He took a hoe and brought it back to the construction site for [Ma Qianzhu][y005].

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] took the hoe, spat on his palms, swung the hoe in a circle, and began to dig. Seeing this posture, Wu De shook his head repeatedly.

Sure enough, after [Ma Qianzhu][y005] had hoed a few times, the hoe head fell off... and he himself fell backward into the pit, holding the hoe handle.

"Oh hahaha... this migrant worker is a fake. Come, come, have you got your temporary residence permit? Let me see it..." Seeing [Ma Qianzhu][y005]'s sorry state, he couldn't help but tease him again.

"What are you talking about? Pull me up quickly..."

"Okay, okay, no more jokes..." Seeing that Committee Member Ma was really angry, he quickly changed his tune.

He jumped into the pit, helped [Ma Qianzhu][y005] fix the hoe, and taught him how to use this tool that had barely evolved in a thousand years.

"Hey, what did you eat yesterday?" he asked while shoveling the earth dug by [Ma Qianzhu][y005] out of the pit with a foreign shovel. He was on guard duty and did some work on the side to avoid looking too idle in front of the leader.

"Don't mention it, dry rations and kelp soup. What about you? I didn't see you at the canteen for meals."

"I had seafood paella. The taste... Little Wei hasn't come back. He's been squatting under Lingao city for almost four days, right?"

"He's happy to do it. They've already changed two batches of people, and he's still squatting there. He'll probably be back today. Seafood paella? Tell me about it." [Ma Qianzhu][y005] became interested in seafood paella.

"Live off the land if you're near the mountains, live off the sea if you're near the sea. These past few days, I've been catching some fish and crabs, and gathering some shellfish, and just cooking them to eat. What, you want to join me? If you want, bring your own rice," Wu De said.

"I want to, but I can't finish the things on the beach. Not everyone is as carefree as you. By the way, the Executive Committee has a new task for you."

"A new task?" Wu De was stunned. Could it be that the Executive Committee knew about him helping out in the kitchen and wanted to transfer him to be a cook?

The five captives had originally thought that being caught as spies was a certain death sentence. Even if the pirates were willing to let them be ransomed for money, they were all poor tenant farmers. They certainly didn't have an eighty-year-old mother, and they couldn't even talk about an eight-year-old son—they were all single. They had come to be spies for the sake of some reward money. Where would they get the money to be ransomed? They were all crying and wailing in the shed where they were being held.

As they were crying, they were all driven out. They saw the little leader who had been interrogating them for the past few days walking over arrogantly, wearing a suit of chain mail they had never seen before, shining in the sun. There were also a few tall leaders beside him. The few of them quickly knelt down.

"Get up, all of you, stand in a line." The little pirate in charge of guarding them whipped them with a thin stick.

Wu De glanced at the five people in front of him. They were all dark and thin. The ancient working people were obviously generally malnourished and looked underdeveloped. Take the guard Yuan Qiushi with the stick next to him, for example. He was only 18 years old, but he was a head taller and a circle bigger than them. Modern children just develop well.

Since they were going to be kept, a personnel management model had to be explored. Although they were facing the natives of the Ming Dynasty, human nature had not changed much over thousands of years. For these captured prisoners, the first thing was to make them "know fear" and dispel all thoughts of resistance. Whether it was the roar of the new recruit squad leader or the show of force from the prison boss, the effect was the same.

He put on a stern face and expressionlessly examined these few people. Xiong Buyou beside him, wearing self-made chain mail and holding a long sword borrowed from [Wen Zong][y002], brandished it fiercely from time to time, intentionally or unintentionally. The five people's legs were trembling, and someone suddenly felt the urge to defecate.

Then they saw another pirate dressed all in white coming over. Although he had a scholarly face and was dressed in a long white robe, he exuded an evil aura, looking a bit like the White Impermanence at a funeral. This person's eyes were darting around, looking at their whole bodies. The few of them didn't even dare to breathe loudly.

"Take off your clothes!" Wu De shouted loudly. The captives couldn't understand his Mandarin and stared at his mouth, not knowing what to do.

Xiong Buyou was about to translate when Wu De shook his head at him and then nodded at Little Yuan. This young man beat them with a stick, and the few of them rolled around holding their heads.

Wu De waved his hand again, and the few of them were driven by Little Yuan's stick to stand in a line again.

"Take off your clothes!"

This time, the command was accompanied by a gesture, pointing at their tattered clothes. The smarter ones understood that they were being told to take off their clothes, but these tattered clothes were not worth much. All of these pirates were dressed better than them. While they were hesitating, Little Yuan's stick came down on them again. This time, they immediately stripped naked, shivering.

"Dr. He, you can examine them."

Since they were going to be kept as laborers, they would have many opportunities to come into contact with the transmigrators in the future. Taking care of their hygiene was also to protect the health of the transmigrators themselves.

He Ma was in charge of giving these people a physical examination. Although he hadn't started yet, he knew from his experience that these people mainly had parasites, skin infections, and the like. Without clean clothes, rarely being able to take a bath, poor housing conditions, and living with livestock, it was not surprising that such a situation occurred.

Then, under Wu De's command and Yuan Qiushi's stick, the few poor people finally understood that they had to stick out their buttocks and even spread them to expose their anuses. Were these pirates going to rape them anally? They didn't look as fair and tender as the young servants around the masters. Although these pirates were all mighty, their taste was really good to have a group anal rape in broad daylight...

He Ma put on a mask and latex gloves. He saw obvious eggs of intestinal parasites in the five spread buttocks. Although he had made full psychological preparations, he still felt the urge to vomit.

All the captives had many sores on their bodies, and there were traces of bites from parasites such as fleas and bedbugs on their skin. But there were no major problems. He examined their hair and, as expected, found many head lice and nits. To his surprise, he also found that two of them had ticks firmly attached to their scalps. This thing was already rare in the era they came from, and could only be encountered in relatively remote wilderness.

He also examined everyone's teeth. They all had tartar and blue lines caused by malnutrition, but no cavities—it was estimated that they had no chance of getting cavities. He Ma was originally worried that they might have malignant diseases such as leprosy or syphilis, but it seemed that these people were all very healthy.

"Let them take a bath," He Ma said. "It seems there's nothing serious. They are very healthy."

"In the river?" Wu De asked. "Won't they get schistosomiasis?"

"No, I've checked the medical and health records of Lingao, and there's no mention of this disease. Besides, no snails have been found in the water source here."

"Get in the river and take a bath!" Wu De's command caused a small commotion. The few captives thought they were going to be driven into the river to be drowned. They wouldn't move, no matter how Little Yuan beat them with his stick. Xiong Buyou had to brandish his steel sword to force them all into the water. In fact, the water was not deep. Wu De had deliberately chosen a very shallow river bay. The few poor people rolled around in the water under the threat of sticks and swords, and from time to time they had to be completely submerged. They only came up when they couldn't hold their breath any longer.

He Ma set up a pot he had found in an empty house on the road on the river beach and boiled all their clothes—to put it simply, it would be best to throw them directly into the fire, but at the moment, the transmigrators did not have much clothing reserves for the local laborers—the textile industry was still only on paper.

The people who were finally allowed to go ashore were pulled to a rock again. This time, it was Yang Baogui's wife's turn. The five captives saw another female pirate coming, dressed in white, her face tightly covered, and holding a sharp knife in her hand. They were scared out of their wits and all covered their lower bodies with their hands. One of them even immediately knelt and crawled to Wu De's feet, kowtowing repeatedly, saying that he was the only son for three generations and would do whatever he was told, but he would not be a eunuch.

Although the nurse couldn't cut hair, she had enough experience in shaving patients for surgery. The scissors and razor in her hand flew around, and in an instant, the five people's heads were shaved bald.

Although the country people had not been indoctrinated with the idea that their bodies, hair, and skin were received from their parents, they were still shocked and frightened when their hair was suddenly shaved off. Someone burst into tears, and the sound was extremely miserable. Even He Ma felt a little unbearable.
