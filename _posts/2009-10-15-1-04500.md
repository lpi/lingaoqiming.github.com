As the moon waxed full, the base shifted into a state of frantic, high-speed operation. The finance department liquidated all remaining assets, converting them into a final torrent of supplies. A small reserve of 500,000 RMB was held back for emergencies, along with ten kilograms of gold, cast into small, easily transportable bars.

All personnel were recalled to the base for final preparations. The medical and health group conducted a final review of the colonists' health, focusing on immunizations. Despite repeated warnings, they discovered a number of individuals who had forged their vaccination records. For some, it was too late to complete the full course of shots. The medical team had no choice but to add more vaccines to their already extensive procurement list.

"Are they gambling with their own lives?" He Ma, the head of the medical group, lamented as he reviewed the list of incomplete immunizations. He knew that 17th-century Hainan would be a paradise for microorganisms. Cholera had been a recurring scourge on the island well into the 20th century.

"Many haven't had corrective eye surgery either," Dr. Lan Fangfang added, his voice tinged with frustration. He was now scrambling to find a full set of old-fashioned optometry equipment, a task that was proving nearly impossible in an age of computerized refractometers.

The procurement of medical supplies was a constant headache. Disposable items were out of the question. Glass syringes, infusion sets, and the small sterilizers that went with them were relics of a bygone era, unearthed from the dusty warehouses of pharmaceutical companies and hospitals. Rubber tubing on old equipment had long since deteriorated, forcing them to commission custom-made replacements at exorbitant cost.

The Executive Committee, however, had given the medical group a blank check. The result was a procurement list that could stock a small hospital:

1.  **Diagnostic Equipment**
    *   One gastroscope set, one B-ultrasound set, one X-ray machine set, one colonoscope set, one laparoscope set, one ECG set, 10 monitoring sets, 5 medical microscopes.

2.  **Treatment Equipment**
    *   2 shadowless lamps (1.5m diameter)
    *   2 surgical tents
    *   2 operating tables
    *   10 oxygen cylinders
    *   10 ventilators
    *   2 gastric lavage machines
    *   2 dental treatment units
    *   2 defibrillators
    *   100 glass syringes (1ml, 5ml, 10ml, 20ml, 50ml)
    *   50 glass IV drip sets
    *   20 sets of surgical instruments
    *   10 sets of dental instruments
    *   5 sets of obstetric instruments
    *   2 sets of orthopedic instruments and equipment
    *   Each set: 1 electric knife, 1 sharp and 1 round scalpel, 4 large, medium, and small hemostatic forceps each, 4 curved forceps, 4 hook forceps, 2 large, medium, and small retractors each, 2 large and small toothed forceps each, 2 large and small plain forceps each, 2 large, medium, and small intestinal spatulas.
    *   Surgical gowns, masks, caps, gloves, etc., in various quantities.
    *   Large quantities of sutures, dressings, gauze, disinfectant, etc.

3.  **Pharmaceuticals**
    *   Emergency drugs: Mannitol, Isoproterenol, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Verapamil, Cedilanid, Amiodarone, Propafenone, Propranolol, Digitalis, Atropine.
    *   Large quantities of the anesthetic Lidocaine.
    *   Large quantities of the diuretic Furosemide.
    *   Large quantities of antibiotics (Penicillin, Erythromycin, Clindamycin, Cephalosporins, Sulfonamides, Ornidazole, Metronidazole, Ofloxacin, Vancomycin - from low to high efficacy).
    *   Large quantities of antiviral drugs (Ribavirin).
    *   Various common drugs, vaccines, and anti-snake venom serums.

4.  **Other Equipment**
    *   Sterilizers, various stainless steel medical utensils, UV disinfection carts, refrigerators, infant incubators, etc.

First-aid kits were configured at 5 per person, with one issued directly to each individual as standard equipment.

If not for the fact that they simply couldn't find a seller, the Executive Committee was even prepared to buy a full field hospital set. But after searching many places, they couldn't find one for sale and had to give up. The Executive Committee's obsession with comprehensiveness in medical matters became so extreme that even the doctors in the health group couldn't stand it anymore and had to stop their ever-increasing demands—they even put a CT scanner on the procurement list, and the doctors had to tell them that while it was useful, it wasn't something they couldn't live without...

As for the personal equipment of the transmigrators, it fully embodied the Executive Committee's spirit of "better to have too much than too little." However, they still configured it in multiple tiers based on different personnel roles.

The standard personal configuration for a transmigrator was A-Level, which was mandatory for everyone.

At this level, the configuration was mainly to meet the needs of daily production and life, while also providing protection for low-level conflicts and short-distance cross-country travel.

It included a knock-off version of the US Marine Corps modular backpack, which could be broken down into 6 bags of different sizes. The average transmigrator was not issued camouflage uniforms, only tropical military-green training uniforms and tropical combat boots, one boonie hat and one helmet-style hat, the latter with a special mosquito net head cover. They were also issued goggles, a raincoat, and high-top rubber boots.

Under normal circumstances, the transmigrators would be housed on the ship or in prefabricated houses at the base, so their lodging items did not emphasize camping. As Hainan is in a subtropical region, they were issued a 15°C rated sleeping bag and a matching moisture-proof mat.

As for protective gear and weapons, A-Level transmigrators would not participate in intense conflicts and only needed limited protection. Therefore, they were issued an anti-stab vest, gloves, and one Type 80 steel helmet—the reason for not choosing a lighter, newer helmet was that organic materials age easily, while the old Type 80 helmets were abundant and cheap.

Communication items were a walkie-talkie and a survival whistle. The walkie-talkie had a communication range of over 1 km and could be networked.

Personal items issued:

*   Waterproof outdoor watch (with functions for altitude, temperature, air pressure, electronic compass, timer, and alarm).
*   One knock-off Swiss Army knife and one short machete.
*   Compass.
*   Headlamp.
*   Flashlight (friction-powered to save batteries).
*   Windproof lighter.
*   Small steel cup (can be used for drinking anything, and as a washing cup in the morning).
*   Outdoor water bottle (effective at preventing corrosion, cool color).
*   Military canteen (comes with a mess tin, which is quite practical).
*   One set each of mess tin, enamel food tray, and travel cutlery.

Finally, each person also received two days' worth of emergency rations: energy bars and beef jerky, plus one sewing kit and one first-aid kit.

As for toiletries and general underwear, socks, and clothes, individuals were to provide their own.

Above A-Level, there were B-Level (for general military personnel and long-range travelers) and C-Level (for scouts and long-range field surveyors). In these two levels, camouflage uniforms and GORE-TEX jackets replaced the training uniforms, and many more professional outdoor, military, and specialized items were added. The list was long and varied. However, many of the items in these two tiers were not issued regularly but were given out temporarily when needed and had to be returned afterward.

According to the committee's repeated calculations, each transmigrator could carry 200kg of personal belongings, including the issued equipment. As long as the total weight was not exceeded, there was no limit on the types of personal items, but firearms were not allowed to be carried privately (any brought must be handed over for unified storage).

Higher-level kits, for military personnel and long-range scouts, included camouflage uniforms, GORE-TEX jackets, and a host of specialized equipment.

Each colonist was allowed 200kg of personal belongings. [Ma Qianzhu][y005], inspecting the packed luggage, shook his head in dismay. Laptops, MP3 players, and PSPs were ubiquitous, as if they were heading to a place with an abundance of power outlets. But essential items like underwear, socks, and toiletries were in short supply. The committee intervened, persuading them to part with their non-essential electronics. Most, however, refused to give up their computers. "It will give us more spare parts," sighed Shi Kai, the head of the IT group.

[Wang Luobin][y003] and the procurement team made a final, frantic dash to nearby cities, purchasing a miscellany of items they had overlooked. The packing and re-packing continued late into the night.

The next morning, they gathered on the training ground, a sea of green-clad figures.

"They look like an army," Xi Yazhou remarked, a note of pride in his voice.

"A disorderly mob," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] grumbled, his eyes scanning the chaotic scene.

"Don't be so cynical, Old Ma," Xi Yazhou said, clapping him on the shoulder. "We are about to sweep across all of China."
