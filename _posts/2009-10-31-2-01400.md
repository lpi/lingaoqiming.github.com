"Lingao," Bei Wei muttered, his eye pressed to the infrared scope. The image was blurry, but the outline was unmistakable. He had seen ancient cities before, from the well-preserved walls of Pingyao to the crumbling foundations of forgotten ruins. But this... this was different. The town was an olive, long and narrow, its back to the Gaoshan Ridge, its face to the Wenlan River. The river curved around it, a natural moat.

The walls were seven meters high, their brick and stone faces a testament to the Ming Dynasty's obsession with defense. On the walls, a line of bonfires and lanterns flickered in the darkness. Soldiers patrolled back and forth, their figures silhouetted against the flames. It was a scene of grim determination, yet he could see the flaws in their defenses. The east and west gates protruded from the walls like vulnerable, exposed nerves. An attacker could concentrate his forces without fear of flanking fire.

Outside the east gate, a cluster of dark, silent buildings. To the south, a long stone bridge, the Linjiang Bridge, spanned the river, its nine arches a graceful, silent sentinel.

"They know we're here," Li Jun whispered.

"Stay alert," Bei Wei replied.

At dusk, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] had summoned him. "Advance to the outskirts of Lingao," he had commanded. "Monitor their movements. Reconnaissance only."

Bei Wei had selected a team of five, armed with rifles, an infrared scope, and a two-watt radio. They had marched through the night, following the river, their night vision goggles turning the darkness into a world of green-tinged shadows. The 12-kilometer journey had taken them less than three hours.

They had established an observation post on a small hill across the river, a perfect vantage point to watch the south and east gates.

"This is Bei Wei," he reported into the radio. "We have reached Lingao. We are observing."

"The situation?" [Ma Qianzhu][y005]'s voice crackled in his ear.

"They are on high alert. Twenty men are patrolling the south wall."

"Continue to monitor. Over."

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] looked at the clock. It was 21:30. More than ten hours had passed since D-Day. The beachhead was secure, but their progress was slow. They were hampered by a lack of building materials, their grand plans for a new world bogged down in the mud and sand of this desolate shore.

Contact with the locals had been non-existent. The beacon fire had scared away the fishing boats, and the surrounding countryside was empty. At the evening's summary meeting, a consensus was emerging: the original "turtle" strategy was too conservative. They needed to move inland, to establish a proper industrial base. The news from the reconnaissance team was encouraging. The locals were in a defensive posture, not an offensive one. This was their chance.

A resolution was passed. At dawn, a second reconnaissance team would be sent out to survey the surrounding area for resources. A third team would survey the route for a new road, a lifeline connecting the port to their future base at Bairen Tan.

"We will survey, design, and construct simultaneously," [Wen Desi][y002] declared, drawing a line on the map. "All available labor and machinery will be diverted to this project. We will open the road in three days."

The military group, already stretched thin, would have to provide security for the new teams. "The organization is short on labor," He Ming, the military commander, said. "When my men are not on duty, they will participate in the construction."

The dawn of D+1 found the reconnaissance team huddled under a camouflage tarp, their clothes damp with dew. On the city wall, the guards were extinguishing the lanterns, their movements slow and weary.

The buildings outside the east gate were temples, their dark, silent forms emerging from the morning mist. The land around the city was a patchwork of paddy fields and wilderness.

Wei Aiwen crawled to Li Jun's position. "Let's make a move," he whispered.

"What do you have in mind?"

"We'll charge the town. A volley from our rifles will send them scattering."

"Just the five of us?" Li Jun glanced at the sleeping forms of their comrades. "You're a left-wing adventurist, Little Wei."

"And you should put on your raincoat first," Li Jun added.

"Why?"

"Dressed as we are, they'll think we're demons. They'll throw dog's blood and feces on us."

Wei Aiwen fell silent. His real motive was a simple, boyish desire to fire his new rifle.

Bei Wei, awakened by their conversation, put an end to their fantasy. "Our mission is reconnaissance, not combat. Firing your weapon will expose our position. And besides," he said, a weary smile on his face, "you collapsed from exhaustion when we arrived. You need your rest."

"You owe me for covering your watch," Li Jun said to Wei Aiwen. "I'm in my thirties. The night shift is bad for my health."
