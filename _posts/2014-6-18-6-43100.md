The Law Society was also drafting a similar research report. This wasn't because of the incident in Lingao, but because the Third Plenary Session was approaching, and it seemed that institutional adjustment was imminent. Therefore, the Law Society had been working on this for half a year.

If it were just this, Ma Jia would have given a professional comment. He would have seen this report, combined with Lu Xuan's various performances today, as a personal stepping stone for him. But the content of the rectification suggestions made Ma Jia fall into deep thought. This proposal was not unimaginable. It was nothing more than suggesting that each administrative department be responsible for clarifying its own functions and powers, formulating departmental regulations according to its own actual situation, and then submitting them to the Executive Committee for deliberation, and finally having the General Assembly of Elders confirm their validity. Although this method was simple and feasible, it was not brilliant.

But this passage had a prerequisite: the departmental regulations submitted by each department must first be reviewed by a "committee composed of policy researchers and relevant professional personnel" before being submitted to the Executive Committee for deliberation.

Recently, various committees had been flying all over the BBS, and Ma Jia was particularly sensitive to the word "committee." Of course, according to this line of thinking, once this institution was established, the members of the Law Society would naturally be elected to this "committee" because of their professional background.

Are you trying to curry favor with the Law Society, preparing to use this as a stepping stone? Ma Jia thought for a moment and said, "Your proposal is very good. As for revisions—this is, after all, a project of the Great Library. It's not appropriate for our Law Society to interfere. A paper like this can't have too many authors. Hahaha, hahaha."

Just as Lu Xuan was about to say something more, there was a knock at the door from the secretary.

"Come in!"

The secretary came in and reported, "Chief Ji has arrived."

"Please have him come in."

At the mention of "Chief Ji," Lu Xuan's eyebrows twitched imperceptibly.

Soon, the "Native Protection Association" president, a veteran teacher at the Fangcaodi teaching garden, and the most famous "soy sauce" Elder in the Senate, Ji Xin, with his thick eyebrows, big eyes, and sturdy figure, appeared before everyone.

Lu Xuan was the first to stand up and greet Ji Xin with a smile. "Hello, Teacher Ji."

This Elder, who had participated in all major legal events in the Senate but insisted on staying at Fangcaodi to teach and refused to take up an administrative position, living a solitary life, was a person Lu Xuan could never figure out. When faced with people he couldn't figure out, Lu Xuan would always be extra careful. He and Ji Xin had both taught at Fangcaodi and were considered semi-colleagues in the education circle. Every time they met, Lu Xuan would address him as "teacher."

"Teacher Lu is also here..." Among the Elders, Lu Xuan was the only one who addressed him as "teacher." Ji Xin was very pleased with this simple and cordial address. Over time, he also learned to greet the other party in the same way as Lu Xuan.

"Director Yu arranged for me to come and ask for instructions from Commissioner Ma." After speaking, Lu Xuan said to Ma Jia, "Commissioner Ma, you have business to attend to, so I won't disturb you. If there are any problems with the report, please notify me at any time."

"Alright, leave the report with me for now. Please tell Director Yu that we will definitely study it carefully. If there are any developments, I will have Director An contact you."

Ma Jia stood up again, shook hands with Lu Xuan, and saw him to the door.

"What's he doing here?" Ji Xin asked An Xi with a puzzled look after Ma Jia had closed the door.

An Xi answered while pouring tea for Ji Xin, "The Great Library is preparing to do a policy research on a legal topic. The project is being handled by Lu Xuan. He came today with a draft of the proposal for Commissioner Ma to review. The proposal is still on Commissioner Ma's desk. I don't know the specific content."

"The Great Library? A proposal on a legal topic? Handled by Lu Xuan?" A series of question marks popped up in Ji Xin's head after hearing An Xi's words.

Although Ji Xin was not familiar with Lu Xuan, his impression of him was not good. Although Lu Xuan's work was exemplary when they worked together, and Lu Xuan had always been polite in their few limited interactions, as the president of the "Native Protection Association," Ji Xin was extremely disgusted with Lu Xuan's actions at the Lu Family Manor. Out of consideration for their status as both Elders and colleagues, Ji Xin had not openly broken with Lu Xuan, but he had always deliberately kept his distance from him, greeting him only perfunctorily when they met.

At this moment, Lu Xuan, who was already in the carriage, was also uneasy about Ji Xin's appearance. Unlike Ji Xin, Lu Xuan clearly remembered every interaction he had with him. Especially more than four years ago, when he and Ji Xin participated in disaster relief together, Lu Xuan had handed over several orphans taken in by the disaster relief work groups to Ji Xin. Among them, two children who wished to study were recommended by Ji Xin to enter Fangcaodi...

Ma Jia picked up Lu Xuan's report from the table and handed it to Ji Xin. Ji Xin quickly flipped through the report. He was not surprised by the beautiful fountain pen handwriting on the report; he had seen Lu Xuan's writing skills during public classes. But he was equally surprised by the content of the proposal. Ji Xin's brows furrowed, and the usual sad expression on his face became even heavier. Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, but the strongest was the gradually ferocious face of Lu Xuan that kept emerging from the depths of his mind.

Ji Xin couldn't sort out his thoughts for a moment. He looked up at Ma Jia. Ma Jia's face was as calm as an ancient well, while An Xi was anxiously trying to get closer. Ji Xin quickly handed the report to An Xi.

An Xi was also surprised by Lu Xuan's report, because he thought he knew Lu Xuan, and the level of this report greatly exceeded his expectations of him. After the surprise, An Xi's face was more confused, but he muttered, "I'm afraid it's not as simple as he says. This Master Lu is probably trying to use Commissioner Ma and our Law Society as a stepping stone!"

An Xi's inference did not mean that he had really figured something out, but rather a natural defense against Lu Xuan's sudden appearance. To be obsequious for no reason is to be either a traitor or a thief. He understood this much.

"Master Lu? The Zhang Family Manor in East Gate City?" Ma Jia was the Executive Committee member in charge of the powerful departments. Hearing An Xi's words, he suddenly thought of something.

"Yes, Lu Xuan is actually the master of the Zhang Family Manor."

After An Xi finished speaking, Ma Jia's expression changed again. He looked at the confused An Xi, then at the seemingly enlightened Ji Xin, and held back what he was about to say.

Ji Xin also raised his head, his eyes looking at the ceiling. After a long while, he said to himself, "The Three Offices Ordinance Department!"

Hearing Ji Xin utter such a sentence, Ma Jia and An Xi were both confused. But An Xi seemed more anxious and immediately asked, "What? What Three Offices Ordinance Department? What does that mean?"

"In the second year of the Xining era of the Northern Song Dynasty, Wang Anshi was appointed as the Vice Grand Councilor and presided over the reforms. At his suggestion, the Three Offices Ordinance Department was established to be responsible for formulating new laws and regulations. Later, this institution actually became the headquarters of Wang Anshi's reforms," Ji Xin said. He was a graduate of the East China University of Political Science and Law and was familiar with the "Xining Reforms," which had left a heavy mark on the history of the legal system.

"Reform headquarters?!!"

Ji Xin found An Xi's jaw-dropped expression amusing. He continued, "At its inception, the Three Offices Ordinance Department was not only responsible for formulating new laws and regulations, but also in charge of the national finances..."

"He also wants to seize the power of the General Treasury?" An Xi couldn't help but interject again.

"He doesn't have that intention. The Three Offices Ordinance Department was also responsible for supervising the implementation of the new laws and had the power to inspect and impeach local officials. I'm just explaining how powerful this institution was," Ji Xin said, worried that An Xi's imagination would run wild. He continued to explain.

"Indeed, the power to be responsible for the formulation of new laws and the supervision of their implementation is extraordinary," Ma Jia said.

An Xi held up the report in his hand and said indignantly, "The Great Library has a good plan, trying to use our Law Society as a ladder to fight for their own positions. The formulation of departmental laws is a major national affair. How can they handle it with their level of expertise? Commissioner Ma, I'll go and refuse them right now."

Ji Xin, however, had a relaxed expression. He said, "His suggestion is very clear. He wants to form this preliminary review committee with professional personnel. In his wording, you can't find any problems. It's all official business."

"The Great Library is clearly trying to use the Law Society as a workhorse while they themselves pick the peaches. Who doesn't know that the *Policy Research* submitted to the Executive Committee is their Great Library's unique specialty?" An Xi had completely dismissed Lu Xuan. He couldn't believe that such a scheming proposal was made by Lu Xuan.

"Hehe, do you really think this is the Great Library's idea?" Ji Xin said slowly.

An Xi immediately thought of something, and the expression on his face became natural again. He turned to look at Ma Jia.

Ma Jia gave Ji Xin a meaningful look and said, "I also don't think Old Yu would do this. He's a man who has read old history books. How could he not know this trick? He's now in a prestigious and leisurely position, and he's in his own field of history. Administrative law, organizational regulations—he doesn't understand these. What's the point of playing this trick? What benefit would he get if this proposal passed?"

"So you're saying—"

"That's right. I think it's Master Lu's own plan," Ji Xin said, never one to mince words. He smiled slightly. "How much do you know about this Master Lu?"

"Not much," Ma Jia said cautiously. An Xi, being tactful, said, "I have something to do, I'll go back to my office first."

"I know a little about this Director Lu," Ji Xin said. "You know he married a native wife, right?"

Ma Jia shook his head. "I really don't know. He's always been a recluse and has had little contact with our Law Society. I have no idea about his personal life."

"You are the director of the Political Security Bureau, after all. Well, that's a bit of a taboo subject. Let's get back to the point: did you know that not long after he got married, his father-in-law and brother-in-law both died in accidents?"

"Such a thing happened?!" Ma Jia was very surprised. "You mean..."
