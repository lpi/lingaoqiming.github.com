Bei Kai stood on the watchtower of the salient, and without a telescope, he could see the bandits in the distance, like a pile of sheep droppings, winding their way in a slow-moving cluster.

He knew yesterday that the bandits' target was Hon Gai—a large group of people had gathered with open flames and weapons just twenty miles from here, and it was obvious what they wanted to do. Moreover, a few days ago, a letter was sent from Haiyang, asking him to pay attention to the defense of Hon Gai: a group of bandits was recruiting people on a large scale, preparing to "do a big job."

"Defense, defense, am I supposed to defend Hon Gai with thirty people?" Bei Kai grumbled. Of course, he also had Zhang Dabala's Zhennan and the sailors on several small boats. Although Great Wave Shipping was "civilian shipping," the sailors on the ships were all quasi-military personnel who had undergone naval training. Many of them were old pirates with years of experience and were quite capable of fighting.

More than 300 naturalized laborers had received some military training and had the necessary weapons and equipment, so they could be used as militia in a fight. In addition, with the cannons of Hon Gai Fort itself and the support of the Zhennan at sea, the possibility of Hon Gai Fort falling was extremely small. But Hon Gai was not just a fortress, but a city composed of a fortress, two camps, and a commercial street. It was certainly foolproof to concentrate the naturalized laborers to defend Hon Gai Fort, but the two local labor camps and the commercial street would be devastated. Unlike the naturalized citizens, the local laborers, although they felt that the work here was good, had served the Lingao regime for a short time and lacked a sufficient sense of identity. They had not undergone strict military training, and their organization, discipline, and determination to resist were all very low. The bandits would scatter as soon as they arrived.

The local workers were now the main force in digging coal. If they all ran away, the production of Hon Gai would be reduced by at least two-thirds. It would take some time to restore the commercial street and labor camps that the bandits had destroyed. There were also the small railways leading to the mine pits, and the simple derricks and manual winches installed by the mine pits for lifting. These things were all easily damaged by the bandits. Once the facilities were damaged, the production efficiency of the entire coal mine would plummet.

The most dangerous thing was that the scattered workers would spread the news of the attack on Hon Gai. If the bandits also killed many local workers to vent their anger, it would be very difficult to recruit local laborers in the future. After all, no one wanted to live on the edge of a knife.

Bei Kai felt that he was in a dilemma. He immediately summoned Dugu Qiuhun, Bai Guoshi, and Zhao Xue, who were in Hon Gai, to hold a meeting of the elders to deal with the situation. Zhang Dabala and the platoon leader of the marine platoon also participated in this meeting.

At the meeting, it was decided to immediately withdraw all the laborers from the quarantine camp into the labor camp to abandon the quarantine camp and reduce the guarded area. All naturalized laborers were to be armed. Some would remain to defend Hon Gai Fort, and some would defend the labor camp. The straight-line distance between the labor camp and Hon Gai Fort was only 250 meters, and the artillery of Hon Gai Fort could effectively assist in the defense of the labor camp.

Protective trenches would be dug around the labor camp and Hon Gai Fort and filled with seawater. The standardized bamboo spikes that had been transported would also be planted in large numbers. The goods and equipment in the shops and canteens were naturally to be scorched earth. Bei Kai originally wanted to have the sailors and cannons of the Zhennan and several other ships land to strengthen the defense, but was dissuaded by Zhang Dabala.

Zhang Dabala believed that the enemy was very likely to advance by both land and water. To withdraw the sailors and cannons would be to cripple themselves. Once the sea was blockaded by the enemy, there would be nowhere to escape. Secondly, the sea ships could maneuver along the coast and use their firepower to strike at the enemy who tried to bypass the side of Hon Gai Fort, forcing them to attack the fortress from only a few directions, which would reduce the defensive pressure on Hon Gai Fort itself.

As for the marines, Zhang Dabala believed that there was no need for them to stay in Hon Gai Fort. The marines could board the small boats and maneuver at sea, waiting for an opportunity. Once an opportunity was found, the marines could quickly land and launch a fierce attack on the bandits' weak points.

This proposal was very different from Bei Kai's idea. In his opinion, the best way was to withdraw all troops into the fortress to resist—anyway, it would take at most a day and a night for reinforcements to arrive from Lingao. To divide the troops to carry out "behind-the-back attacks" and "mobile warfare" made him a little hesitant.

Zhang Dabala's idea was different from his: of course, Zhang Dabala also knew that Hon Gai could not be broken, but he was a newcomer who had recently surrendered and followed the dragon. His desire to "render meritorious service" was much greater than that of an elder like Bei Kai. Only by killing as many enemies as possible could he show the ability of Hon Gai. How could he just cry for help and wait for reinforcements?

As for the marine platoon leader, he also agreed with Zhang Dabala's idea, and his proposal went even further. He wanted to take the 12-pound mountain howitzer with him, along with a few laborers to push the cannon. Whether on the boat or on land, the mountain howitzer, which could be pushed by two or three people, could provide great fire support.

"In addition to the gunners, we will also have ten laborers to act together, each carrying 2 portions of ammunition. We will also bring some on the boat. 10 rounds of canister shot, 4 rounds of high-explosive, and 6 rounds of solid shot," the marine second lieutenant gestured.

Bai Guoshi was very supportive of Zhang Dabala's idea. He was young and vigorous, and he had developed both muscles and courage in the remote exploration team. He was no longer the pitiful university waste he used to be. He was eager to show off his military prowess to everyone—and to Zhao Xue as well. Courage and violence have always been a man's peacock tail.

Zhao Xue was not interested in fighting and opposed going out to fight. However, Dugu Qiuhun was very interested in going out to fight and resolutely demanded to go out to "fight to the death." Of course, his purpose was to gain political capital for his "comeback." To return to the violent institutions, "military merit" was the most convincing.

The four elders were tied two to two, and according to the system of collective decision-making by the elders on major issues, a decision could not be made. However, strictly speaking, Bai Guoshi, Zhao Xue, and Dugu Qiuhun were all on temporary assignment. The only elder at Hon Gai Station was Bei Kai, and he had the right to make the final decision.

In the end, Bei Kai decided to adopt Zhang Dabala's suggestion. The marine platoon and the ships of the Great Wave Shipping Company would be responsible for external maneuvering, waiting for an opportunity to launch a flank attack, while the elders would defend the camp. Dugu Qiuhun volunteered to lead a team to defend the labor camp alone, and Bei Kai agreed—he didn't want to cause Zhao Xue to cry again by sending Bai Guoshi.

The entire Hon Gai mine was quickly mobilized. The naturalized laborers were all armed and organized, and were immediately armed and deployed according to their squadrons. The main force was deployed in Hon Gai Fort, and one squadron was deployed in the labor camp. Dugu Qiuhun put on his armor, wearing an 80-style iron helmet and an elder-specific steel plate breastplate. He held a Japanese katana made in Wenzhou in his right hand and a GLOCK 17 pistol with an extended magazine in his left hand. He majestically mounted the wall of the labor camp. Below, the local laborers had already gathered in a dark mass, and more than a dozen translators who understood both Chinese and the local language were scattered around.

The local laborers were gathered and informed of the news that a large group of bandits was about to arrive in Hon Gai. The laborers became agitated, but after being frightened by a few words like "the bandits are only seven or eight miles away, if you run out on your own, you will be sending yourselves to your deaths," no one dared to run away—after all, it was safest to hide in the stockade when the bandits came. Some of the laborers had families with them, and the women and children would have a hard time escaping from the bandits.

"Don't worry when the bandits come, I will lead everyone to drive them away!" Dugu Qiuhun put on a confident look and waved the katana in his hand. "Let's work together to defend the stockade, to protect both the mine and ourselves! Anyone who doesn't work hard to defend the stockade and kill the enemy, everyone knows what the consequences will be if the bandits break through the stockade!"

Then, Dugu Qiuhun ordered that the young and strong men be given equipment—all temporarily assembled. Each young and strong man was given a rattan helmet safety helmet, which was originally a work hat for the naturalized laborers. As the war approached, the naturalized laborers were now all wearing "fighting helmets" with cross-shaped reinforcing steel bars on the top. The ones that were replaced were given to the local laborers. They wore wooden boards or rattan rows temporarily processed as armor. A small wooden board was also fixed on their arms to be used as a shield. There were not enough standard spears to give to the local laborers, so a batch of sharpened and hardened bamboo spears and wooden spears were temporarily processed. A part of the laborers were also equipped with various tools used for mining, and could carry out hand-to-hand combat if necessary.

Then, some of the local laborers were arranged at the entrance of the stockade, and some were deployed on the slope outside the earthen wall. On the outer slope, protective barriers were erected with rattan woven boards and wooden boards. The top of the earthen wall was occupied by the squadron of naturalized laborers—they served as the reserve and the督战队 (dū zhàn duì - a team to supervise the battle and prevent retreat).

"If you don't want to die, use the weapons in your hands to poke the enemy out!" Dugu Qiuhun roared murderously, waving his katana. "Otherwise, if the bandits break in, your whole family will die! Don't be afraid! If one person dies, the Hon Gai Mining Bureau will support his wife and children for a lifetime! If you are injured, we will treat you! If we repel the bandits, your salary for a month will be doubled! If anyone is a coward, a traitor, or causes chaos in the ranks, don't blame us for being ruthless and spearing his菊花 (jú huā - chrysanthemum, a euphemism for anus) first!"

More than a dozen translators roared and translated his words. The local laborers saw that the naturalized citizens were all well-equipped and murderous, and knew that this group of Chinese wanted to use them as cannon fodder, but they did not dare to resist. Resisting would also mean death, so it was better to fight back against the bandits and have a chance to live.

Bei Kai instructed that all the grenades that had been transported be distributed. A total of five hundred grenades were equipped to the militia among the naturalized laborers—they had received at least one live-fire throwing training. In order to strengthen the firepower of Hon Gai Fort, the typewriter from the Zhennan was also removed and installed on the watchtower of Hon Gai Fort.

The small fleet of Hon Gai Station consisted of the Zhennan and four other small boats. Each boat was fully equipped. The marine platoon and the mountain howitzer boarded a long dragon boat. The other three long dragon boats were responsible for cover. The Zhennan directly covered the coastline of Hon Gai Station and stopped all attacks from the sea.
