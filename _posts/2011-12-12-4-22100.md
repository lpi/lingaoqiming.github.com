Fu Fu let out a cry and jumped down into the ditch, wielding his shovel with great vigor. Fu Bu'er spat out the cigarette butt that was almost burning his lips and followed him down into the ditch. He had thought about this conversation for half the night: it was certainly good that Fu Fu wanted to marry Yijin, but to be discharged just for that would only add another laborer to the family, who would need to be fed and clothed—besides, he was his son-in-law, and sooner or later he would have to give Yijin a share of the family property. It would be better to let him make a name for himself in the army. Then, the family wouldn't have to spend any money, and having an officer as a son-in-law would give them more standing in the village.

If Fu Fu didn't become an officer, he naturally wouldn't have to keep his promise. If Fu Fu died in battle—and from what Chief Wan had said, there were still several big, tough battles to come—Yijin wouldn't have to be a widow. In this poor, remote southern county, there wasn't much of a concept of widow's chastity, but the value of a young maiden and a remarried widow were different.

Fu Fu had no idea of his "father-in-law's" calculations. Feeling that his request had been granted, he was filled with energy and worked even harder. In their conversation, Fu Bu'er also revealed many of his worries, the biggest of which was that he was only half a village chief. The East and West villages of Meiyang were at odds with each other, and his words had almost no effect in West Village. The villagers there would only comply with orders from the Chiefs, unlike in East Village where he was met with a hundred responses to a single call.

"At least the militia captain is a reasonable person. Otherwise, if they really went against each other, this village would have no peaceful days."

The militia captain of Meiyang Village was an outsider from West Village, a retired soldier. He had been hit by an arrow in the Battle of Chengmai, which had injured his muscles and bones. Although he could walk without difficulty, he could no longer run or carry heavy loads for long distances, so he had settled in Meiyang Village as the militia captain according to the policy for medical discharge. His home was in West Village. As a member of the village cadres, he had more interaction with Fu Bu'er.

Fu Fu said, "I think you should bring this up with the Chiefs during the county meeting and see what they have to say. The Chiefs have many ideas; maybe they can solve it for you. If you keep it to yourself now, what will you do if something happens in the future?"

Fu Bu'er said, "That's true. I must bring up this matter of the outsiders at the next meeting..."

As they were talking, they saw Fu Er Yin rushing over in a panic. "Quick! Jiang Wu is running away!" After saying this, he turned and ran.

Hearing this, Fu Bu'er immediately dropped his hoe and scrambled up the bank of the ditch in a few moves. He grabbed his clothes hanging on a branch and said over his shoulder, "I have to go see what's going on!"

Fu Fu saw how rushed his master was, not even bothering to put on the straw sandals he had taken off by the ditch. He didn't know what emergency had occurred. Now considering himself a "prospective son-in-law," he was very concerned about the Fu family's affairs. He quickly climbed up, put on his straw sandals, and followed along.

When they reached the village entrance, a crowd had already gathered. Many people had clearly come from the fields to watch the spectacle, some still holding their farm tools. The circle of people was noisy and chaotic, and above all the voices, he could hear the curses of Fu Bu'er's wife.

Curious, Fu Fu squeezed through the dense crowd and saw Jiang Wu in the middle. Fu Fu knew Jiang Wu. He had no land of his own; he and his wife tenanted a few acres of garden land from Fu Bu'er's family and also did odd jobs for others. They were one of the poorest households in the village.

A bundle lay on the ground, having come undone, revealing a few tattered clothes, some dried sweet potato slices, and two pairs of straw sandals. There was another bundle next to it. A shabby straw hat worn for work was trampled to pieces on the ground.

A small woman was kneeling on the ground, crying and begging for mercy, dressed in equally tattered clothes, her hair disheveled.

Fu Bu'er had already grabbed Jiang Wu. Jiang Wu was a small man, often going hungry, no match for Fu Bu'er who ate well every day and did heavy labor. The Fu family's mistress's hair was disheveled, and her sleeve was torn. It was clear she had already had a fight with Jiang Wu and his wife before Fu Bu'er arrived.

Fu Bu'er grabbed Jiang Wu by the collar and landed several punches, making him shrink his neck. Jiang Wu simply squatted on the ground, looking like a dead pig that doesn't fear boiling water.

"Jiang Wu! You ungrateful brat!" Fu Bu'er panted, scolding him. "You and your wife are two able-bodied people, not missing any hands or feet. You took two chickens from the Heaven and Earth Society, and you couldn't even turn in forty eggs! In the end, you even lost the chickens! This time, for the sheep loan, the Heaven and Earth Society was unwilling. I had to be your guarantor to get it for you! Fine, a few days later you say the sheep are lost—and you want to just run away? How am I supposed to explain this to the Heaven and Earth Society?!"

Of course, Fu Bu'er had his own selfish interests in this. He was the guarantor for the sheep loan. If Jiang Wu ran away, Fu Bu'er would have to repay the principal and interest in full. Secondly, Jiang Wu tenanted a few acres of garden land from Fu Bu'er. Fu Bu'er had used the loan guarantee as leverage to force Jiang Wu to accept harsh sharecropping terms. Now that such a cheap laborer was running away, renting out the land again wouldn't be as profitable.

Jiang Wu wilted on the ground, not daring to speak. Some of the onlookers tried to mediate, while others watched for entertainment. It was very strange that Jiang Wu's two consecutive loans from the Heaven and Earth Society had ended like this. Especially the egg-laying chicken loan, almost no one had ever lost money on it. Returning 20 eggs was considered repayment of the principal, all eggs were bought back, cheap feed that increased egg production was provided, and even the chickens were bought back when they could no longer lay eggs. It was almost as if the Heaven and Earth Society was giving away free money.

As for raising sheep, it wasn't difficult either. You just had to cut some grass every day, and let the children or the elderly take them out to graze during the day. If a family was short on hands, they could just take the sheep to the edge of the field while they worked, and let them graze on the wild grass on the ridges. Although the common people were suspicious, they were not stupid. After more than a year, they naturally knew that the Heaven and Earth Society was genuinely helping them increase their production and income. Therefore, most people had little sympathy for a "failure" like Jiang Wu: to mess things up under such good conditions.

And after he had messed up the loans twice, the Heaven and Earth Society hadn't arrested him and tortured him, or just taken his wife and sold her—in the past, it would have been perfectly justified for a creditor to do so, and no one could say otherwise. The Heaven and Earth Society had only given him six months to repay the principal and interest, otherwise they would sue him in court.

"Master Fu, please have mercy..." Jiang Wu's wife knelt on the ground, pleading bitterly. "We really have no other choice. If this goes on, we'll never be able to repay the Heaven and Earth Society's debt. We have to go out and find work..."

"Nonsense! If you just run away, where are the Heaven and Earth Society's Chiefs going to find you? How will you repay the debt? You have bad intentions!" Fu Bu'er scolded.

Jiang Wu argued, "Master Fu, please see clearly! We're just tenanting a few acres of your garden land, working day and night, but after paying the rent, it's hard to even have enough to eat... let alone have money to repay the Heaven and Earth Society's debt..."

Fu Bu'er's face immediately fell. Just as he was about to explode, the Fu family's mistress jumped up. "Well now, you two wretched dogs! So it's our fault for renting the land to you?! I wonder which ungrateful person begged our master to be their guarantor in the first place? Heavens..." With that, she plopped down on the ground and started wailing. The scene became even more chaotic.

In the midst of the clamor, the resident policeman squeezed in:

"Nothing to see here, nothing to see here," he said, dispersing the crowd. "Go to the fields if you have to, go home if you have to. Don't all just stand here!" Under his urging, some people left, but many still lingered to watch the show.

Seeing the resident policeman arrive, Fu Bu'er felt it was inappropriate to continue the argument. He just said with a grim face, "If you don't want to tenant my land, fine! But you can't just leave like this! Settle your previous debts first!"

The resident policeman learned what had happened. He ordered Jiang Wu and his wife to go back home first and not to leave the village without permission. According to the latest household registration regulations, if Jiang Wu and his wife wanted to leave their registered residence for a long period to work elsewhere, they had to first register their destination and purpose in the village and then obtain a certificate.

They owed a loan to the Heaven and Earth Society, which already put them in a "key population" category. Now they were trying to run away. If his "key population" ran off, it would look very bad on the resident policeman's monitoring report. He couldn't help but scold them harshly all the way back to their home.

Fu Fu had been standing by, but he hadn't said a word. He had seen similar things many times. A large part of Fu Bu'er's history of getting rich was through giving out small, high-interest loans. Through this, he had seized the land of many families in the village and had even forced some to flee. Fu Fu had even followed Fu Bu'er back then to dismantle the wooden beams and thatch from the houses of those who had fled, to recover some of the interest.

However, after seeing the Heaven and Earth Society offering small agricultural loans, Fu Bu'er had stopped his own lending business—his loan terms were far from being as favorable as the Australians'. Besides, after becoming the village chief, he had to be somewhat mindful of his reputation in the village. The reputation of being a usurer was, after all, not a good one.

As he was watching, he suddenly saw the figure of Fu Yizhuang flash past in the crowd. Fu Fu's eyes lit up, and he immediately followed. When he was sent to Bopu to be a soldier, this Fu Yizhuang had not only threatened them with a saber along the way but also frequently beat and cursed them, only giving them sweet potatoes to eat. Because he had uncontrollable diarrhea and was squatting by the roadside, unable to get up in time, Fu Yizhuang, growing impatient, had kicked him over into his own filth... Thinking of this, the image of the boy who had died of diarrhea on the way appeared before his eyes... Fu Fu was suddenly filled with a vicious courage and quietly followed him.

During dinner last night, Fu Fu had learned that the Fu You San family had taken a fall during last year's autumn tax collection and land survey. Most of their land had been confiscated. Er Zhuang and San Zhuang had gone to the city to become workers, leaving only Yi Zhuang and Fu You San. Fu You San had become half-mad, and no one paid him any mind. Yi Zhuang was left to live on fifty acres of land. The former arrogance of the Fu You San family was completely gone. Everyone in the Fu Bu'er family, from top to bottom, felt a sense of vindication.
