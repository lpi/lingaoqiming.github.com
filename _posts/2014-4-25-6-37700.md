There were sixty-four people in the selection group for each grade. From the first year of primary school to the third year of senior primary school at Fangcaodi, there were a total of more than three hundred top students from five grades wearing the insignia of the learning institute, accompanying these ten or so little Senators in their studies. As for middle school students, there were no middle school students among the naturalized citizens yet...

*I guess this is what they mean by "accompanying the prince in his studies."*

"What are you thinking about!" The short-haired girl sat on the desk with a plop and pulled the earbud Ziqi was listening to music with into her own ear. She was the child of another Senator, named Zhang Yunmi. Because she and Ziqi were of similar age, they got along quite well. "Lend me your PSP for a few days when I go back this time."

"Are you paying rent?" Ziqi raised an eyebrow.

"Tsk, tsk, tsk, you money-grubbing woman," Zhang Yunmi teased. "I'll lend you my manga, alright? Yoshizumi Wataru, Tachibana Kaimu... and Asagiri Yu!"

"Deal!"

"You lecherous woman! But your PSP only has a few games, and I'm tired of playing them over and over again. Please get some new ones. There are so many games in the resource area. There's nothing you can't think of, and nothing you can't download."

"Ever since we moved to the new house, we haven't had an internet connection. To download something, I have to go to the entertainment center in the apartment complex and queue up—you know my family lives on a farm—I'm too lazy to go," Lin Ziqi said lazily. "You can download them yourself."

"I'm really impressed by you. What a waste."

"I'm used to not playing games," Lin Ziqi was not so much of a homebody anymore. There were too many fun things to do on the farm. Her father had set up a small flower garden for her, and she spent most of her spare time tending to various herbs and plants.

"Where are you planning to go for the holidays?"

"Home."

"How boring," Zhang Yunmi frowned. "I don't want to go back. There's a new baby sister at home, and she cries all day long. It's so annoying! You're much better off."

Zhang Yunmi's father's personal secretary had just given birth to a daughter. Although their house was a large unit, having an extra baby in the apartment was quite a commotion.

"Sooner or later, they'll give me a little brother or sister or something..." Lin Ziqi said nonchalantly. "I don't care, it's not like I have to take care of them."

"Where can we go if we don't go home? Lingao is only so big, and it's not convenient for us to go out."

Lingao County itself was not large, nor was it a traditional scenic spot. There were very few places to visit. Besides Gaoshanling, which had been designated as a restricted area, there were only the Senate's dedicated leisure areas at Lingao Cape and Guyin Waterfall.

The problem was Gaoshanling. The whole class went there for "summer study" every year. As for Lingao Cape Park and the "underground waterfall," they had been there many times and were a bit tired of it.

"Let's go to the Feiyun Club at Lingao Cape. They're having a barbecue party again this Sunday. I heard they're also making seafood pizza."

Pizza? This delicacy piqued Ziqi's interest. "Seafood pizza?"

Hearing this, Zhang Yunmi laughed. "That's right, that's right. Lingao is rich in this resource."

"Even if it's rich, I still love to eat it. The sea bream sashimi I had last time was delicious, and so were the grilled oysters. As long as it's not seafood porridge..." At the mention of seafood porridge, a faint feeling of discomfort welled up in both of their stomachs.

"And there are small cakes. If you go late, they'll be gone," Zhang Yunmi said with a drooling expression when she talked about desserts. "I don't understand why they're so stingy. They only make so little each time. I see that the flour in the special supply store is sold openly..."

"Most cakes are made with low-gluten flour..." Lin Ziqi was, after all, the daughter of a Senator from the Agriculture Committee, so she was well-versed in this area. "The Agriculture Committee doesn't grow much. There's also a kind of hard wheat, which is also rare—the food factory is now using it to make pasta."

"Your agricultural knowledge is so rich..." Zhang Yunmi said in admiration.

"Alright, sometimes I think it would be nice to be a gardener or an agricultural technician like my father. At least I wouldn't have to study advanced mathematics every day..."

This was just talk. Being an agricultural technician in the Agriculture Committee was not easy at all. Not only did they have to go to the countryside often, but squatting in the fields under the hot sun was not something she could endure.

"If you don't study advanced mathematics, you have to study a second and third foreign language. There's no benefit at all." Because Zhang Yunmi's mathematical mind was too poor, she was forced to specialize in languages. In addition to English and Japanese, she had recently been struggling with German. Her extracurricular reading at school was all original foreign language books. For one whole day a week, a Senator who specialized in one of the three foreign languages would come to talk to her and guide her reading. According to the plan, after she had mastered these languages, she would begin advanced education in scientific and technological foreign languages. "God, please let me turn eighteen soon..."

"Do you think it will be better when you're eighteen? We'll graduate from here, but Uncle Hu said that after graduation, we each have to choose a major and follow those Senator uncles to study one-on-one... To be honest, I don't know who I should study with..."

"What do you want to study?"

"I want to be a doctor." Lin Ziqi had no direct understanding of what a doctor was. She just thought that female doctors in white coats were beautiful and intellectual.

"Then you'll have to follow Dr. Shi or Dr. Ai. Or you could learn dentistry from that little dentist Song Junxing? I heard that being a dentist in a foreign country is very lucrative." Zhang Yunmi unconsciously often brought up concepts from the old time and space.

"Facing a person's bloody mouth, I feel very uncomfortable. And what if the patient has bad breath?"

"Then why do you still want to be a doctor? You'll be scared to death if you have to perform surgery!"

"That's true," Lin Ziqi nodded. She was a little confused. In this world, she didn't have to take the university entrance examination, but she still had to face life choices. What major should she choose?

In the Senate, there were all kinds of talents. No matter how niche the subject was, there was always someone who could talk about it. Although she was young, she also understood the Senate's thinking: they not only had to be Senators and manage this new world, but they also had to master the indispensable "black technology" to rule this world. That was why she was studying advanced mathematics day and night, while Zhang Yunmi had to learn three foreign languages at the same time—not to communicate with foreigners, but for the vast amount of foreign scientific and technological materials in the Great Library.

"Well? Are you going to Lingao Cape on Sunday?" Zhang Yunmi asked when she noticed she was a little dazed.

"Of course I'm going. I'll bring my swimsuit and go swimming."

"Why bring a swimsuit?" Ai Beibei had already packed her schoolbag and was about to leave. She overheard their conversation as she passed by. "My little boat, the Xiaocang, is having its trial run on Sunday. You guys should come and play too!"

"What's the Xiaocang? Isn't your family on the Feiyun?"

"My father and Uncle Zhou made it for me—a single-masted boat. It was just launched a few days ago. We're going for a trial run on Sunday. Let's go out to sea together. Let's form a girls' sailing team!"

"I don't know how to sail..." Lin Ziqi hesitated.

"I do. Don't worry!" Qian Duoduo was full of confidence. Although she was only twelve, she was almost as tall as them. Her chest had also started to develop, and it looked like her cup size would be larger than theirs in the future. "By the way, Sonia will also be there. She's also an expert at sailing."

"Sonia? Lin Bo's personal secretary?"

"That's her. She can sail a boat by herself, very skillfully," Qian Duoduo nodded.

"Alright, we'll definitely go."

"Students, the carriage to Bairen City is ready. Please get on board quickly," the life teacher came to inform them.

The younger Senators were picked up by their personal secretaries, but the little Senators over the age of ten were no longer picked up. The Senators were very wary of "being born in the deep palace and raised by women."

At about three o'clock in the afternoon, the temporary school bus to Bairen City in Lingao departed. It was a large four-wheeled public carriage that could seat twenty people when full. Now, with only about ten little Senators, the carriage seemed very empty. Everyone chatted and laughed along the way. The road was flat, and although the carriage was a bit slow, it was not very bumpy.

The topic of conversation on the carriage was, of course, the recent cultural festival. For the little Senators, this was a rare opportunity to liven up their boring and tense study life. Moreover, each of them had talents, and it would be a pity not to perform.

What everyone was most concerned about was the performance of "The Test." This play, adapted from a puppet show, was written by a Senator who had majored in Chinese, and had been polished by several Senators with directing and acting experience. It had not yet been finalized. It was said that several leaders of the Executive Committee would also watch it before it was finally decided, and it had the potential to become a "model play of the Senate."

The play version of "The Test" was actually a modern play. Both the performance style and the acting were from another time and space. Ordinary naturalized citizens had a considerable gap with it. Therefore, the performance was mainly led by the Fangcaodi selection group and the students of the College of Arts and Sciences, who had the most contact with the Senators and the deepest understanding of the Australian lifestyle. The real little Senator, Lin Ziqi, was also selected to play a role.

In another time and space, Lin Ziqi would have been too lazy to even look at this kind of "propaganda-filled" thing. But now, she was eagerly looking forward to being able to perform on stage.

"Zhang Yunmi, why don't you act in 'The Test'?" Qian Duoduo was a little confused—if there was a literary and artistic activist in the first class, it had to be Zhang Yunmi. She originally liked to sing and dance, and she had a considerable foundation in dance.

"The costumes are too ugly, all tattered. I don't want to wear them," Zhang Yunmi said. "I plan to dance." She made a gesture with her upper body. "I signed up for dance this time. I'll be the lead dancer, and the students of the College of Arts and Sciences will perform."

"Speaking of the College of Arts and Sciences, did you know that the Propaganda Department is going to form a girl idol group? They are all selected from the students and graduates of the College of Arts and Sciences," Qian Duoduo said. "I heard that they have been rehearsing in secret. I wonder what songs they will sing? Can they sing well?"

"It's an idol group, so singing doesn't matter," Zhang Yunmi said. "Anyway, it's lip-syncing. It all depends on how well they dance."
