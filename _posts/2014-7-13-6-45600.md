Huang Binkun was taken aback, realizing he had misunderstood. He gave a wry smile, "Just go and find out."

After the servant boy left, he lay down to rest again. But as soon as he closed his eyes, he saw Lei Lunfu's resentful gaze and heard his hoarse screams. He had a few nightmares in a row and decided not to sleep anymore. He went out for a walk to clear his head.

Huang Binkun walked alone through the streets of Guangzhou, his heart filled with confusion. The scholar who had attacked him was dead—Huang Binkun didn't believe it was suicide; it was more likely that the yamen runners had done something to him. When he was in Lingao, he had vaguely heard of a blacklist kept by the Cropped-Hair Bandits, filled with the names of those who opposed them. Anyone on that list was doomed sooner or later.

He was probably on the Cropped-Hair Bandits' blacklist in Lingao as well. At this thought, he felt a pang of regret. This Scholar Lei was a man of daring and action, a hero in his own right. Unlike himself, who had fled from Lingao like a stray dog!

Strolling through the now-familiar streets of Guangzhou, this great southern city, though vast with high walls and seemingly majestic, was filled with an air of decay. Standing at the city gate and looking out, the bustling construction site on the banks of the Pearl River and the slow pace of life within the city seemed like two completely different worlds.

Huang Binkun reflected on his various schemes since the Cropped-Hair Bandits' landing, each one he had thought so clever, yet each as ridiculous as an ant trying to shake a tree. No wonder his father and elder brother had advised him to "be practical." But he just couldn't swallow his pride. It shouldn't be like this!

But what should it be like? In terms of daily life, before the Cropped-Hair Bandits came, he and his father were either on constant alert for bandit and pirate attacks or personally supervising the tenant farmers and laborers in the fields. In their spare time, they repaired the village walls, forged weapons, and trained the local militia. They couldn't even sleep peacefully at night, having to get up to patrol and check if the militiamen on the walls were slacking off. Especially in the early morning—bandits and pirates always liked to choose that time for surprise attacks...

After the Cropped-Hair Bandits came, life had gotten better day by day. Especially after the Tiandihui contracted most of their land, even his father felt much younger, not only walking with a lighter step but also frequently attending various meetings in the county. His brother and sister-in-law's life also seemed to be going well; the recent birth of a new niece was proof of that.

However, their family's status in the county had plummeted. The Huang family used to be the "pillar of Lingao," but now they were just ordinary local gentry. To win the county council elections, his father and elder brother had to go to great lengths to support the Australians' various "campaigns," like puppets on a string...

*It's truly infuriating...* Suddenly, Huang Binkun understood completely. The Cropped-Hair Bandits were not simply aiming for a change of dynasty. They not only wanted to "use barbarian ways to change China," but also to completely alter the long-existing rules of this world. They did not want to share power with the gentry like himself. Their fate was either to become merchants like Scholar Lin, or to become workers and farmers under the rule of the Cropped-Hair Bandits. At best, they could become "cadres"...

Huang Binkun touched his forehead. He finally understood why he had been resisting ever since the Cropped-Hair Bandits came. In the world under their rule, he would not have a privileged social status, he would not have the dignity of not having to kneel before officials, he would not have the privilege of tax exemption, and no one would ever call him "Second Master Huang" again...

At this thought, a wave of emotion washed over him, and he felt the world spin. His chest tightened, and he felt nauseous. He staggered a few steps and quickly leaned against a wall.

"Eh? Brother Huang, what are you doing here?" Suddenly, someone supported his arm.

Huang Binkun steadied himself. It was Wu Ming. They had been engaged in grand discussions at the bamboo lodge just a few days ago, and he had come to visit him yesterday. They were now acquaintances.

"It's nothing, just a momentary imbalance of qi and blood, a little dizzy..."

"Brother Huang, you are injured. You should be resting at your lodging, what are you doing out on the streets?" Wu Ming was very enthusiastic. "Come, come, I'll take you back."

Huang Binkun felt it was an imposition, but he was feeling weak all over, so he could only say, "I'm troubling you, Brother Wu."

"Not at all, not at all. I just came back from school."

Although Wu Ming was a scholar, he was quite strong and supported him all the way back to his lodging. It turned out that he was currently studying at the "Nanyu Community School."

He said he was studying, but he was actually working as an "assistant teacher," teaching the younger students while studying contemporary essays in preparation for the county-level examinations. This was a common practice in private and community schools at the time.

"Brother Wu, with your extensive knowledge, you will surely pass with high honors in this examination..." Huang Binkun had nothing to thank him with, so he could only offer some empty pleasantries.

Wu Ming smiled, "I'll take that as a good omen, Brother Huang. I first took the examination at nineteen and have been struggling in the examination halls for ten years. I'm sure I'll pass this time."

Huang Binkun was secretly puzzled. As the saying goes, "literature hates fate." Many scholars took the examinations their whole lives and died as mere students. He had only been trying for ten years, how could he be so confident of "definitely passing"? Could it be that he had connections? Thinking of his association with Liang Cunhou and the others, he probably had some advantages...

While he was still suspicious, the servant boy returned, indeed with a list. Whether they were the ones who had attacked Huang Binkun that night was unknown, but they had all been arrested by the county yamen along with Lei Lunfu.

Wu Ming saw him scrutinizing the list and was very puzzled. Huang Binkun then briefly recounted the matter of Lei Lunfu.

"So it was him!" Wu Ming smiled, his face full of disdain. "It's good that he's dead."

"What do you mean?" Huang Binkun said. "Although he attacked me in secret, it was out of ignorance. His enmity towards the Cropped-Hair Bandits as if they were enemies is also a sign of a loyalist..."

Wu Ming's face showed a look of disapproval. "Hmph, what kind of loyalist is he? Just a country ruffian. I know a little about his background."

It turned out that although Lei Lunfu's family were natives of Dongguan, they also had property in Guangzhou. He often came to the prefectural city for pleasure and had dealings with the scholars at the county school.

"This man, relying on his family's bit of money and some influence in the county, acted arrogantly in front of everyone. His family bullied people in the countryside, oppressed tenant farmers, and tyrannized the local community. I've heard they even killed someone over a land dispute..." Wu Ming said that a few years ago, when Governor Wang wanted to attack Lingao, Lei Lunfu had been very active, spouting nonsense about how the "Cropped-Hair Bandits had no troops to use" and inciting the scholars to go to the Ziminlou to "uphold the sacred teachings."

"In fact, he was preparing to snatch the women inside. He even had sedan chairs and small boats ready to carry them to the wharf and stuff them into boats to take back to Dongguan as soon as he got them," Wu Ming smiled. "Later, when he saw that no one was paying attention, the government's security was tight, and someone spread the word that the Ziji establishments were already claimed by a big shot at court, he immediately backed down..."

Hearing Wu Ming recount this Scholar Lei's "glorious history," Huang Binkun was at a loss for whether to laugh or cry.

"Later, when the Australian fleet attacked the Pearl River, his family organized the local militia to try to protect themselves. As a result, they were defeated, and his whole family was wiped out. Lei Lunfu became a stray dog," Wu Ming continued with great interest. "As for these few on your list, although I don't know them, I know they are all of the same ilk as Lei Lunfu, a bunch of good-for-nothings. Loyalty is out of the question, but it's true they have personal grudges against the Australians."

Huang Binkun was secretly disappointed. His fantasy of assembling a core group of "loyalists" was instantly shattered. He then asked about the attitude of the various people in the market towards the Australians. Wu Ming gently waved his fan and said, "Generally speaking, it's a mixed bag of praise and criticism."

It turned out that ever since Guangzhou paid the ransom, although the Cropped-Hair Bandits had withdrawn their troops from under the city walls, their influence remained immense. Not only had Proprietor Guo returned openly, but his business was also better than before, and he no longer needed to be secretive about some of his past practices.

"Take these Australian goods, for example. At first, they were just rare curiosities. Then came paper and ink. Later, all kinds of needles, thread, iron nails, tools, and farm implements flooded in, as well as useful and cheap things like matches... The government didn't dare to interfere, let alone levy taxes..."

As a result, countless small businesses and workshops in Guangzhou went bankrupt.

"Wasn't there a great deal of public resentment?"

Wu Ming nodded. "Naturally. There were several riots in the city over this. The government feared the Cropped-Hairs like tigers; how would they dare to speak up for the people? Plus, they were all well-fed with silver by the Australians... Fortunately, the Australians have charity halls in the city. Those who really couldn't survive could go there to enlist. Those willing to relocate were sent to Lingao for settlement; those unwilling could go to the 'Great World' construction site outside the city to work—at least they could make a living..."

"First, they harm the common people, then they entice them with food and warmth. How venomous!"

"Who says otherwise!" Wu Ming nodded. "As for the wealthy merchants and gentry with large businesses, some made a lot of money selling Australian goods, others didn't care about a little money, and they enjoyed all sorts of novel Australian gadgets. They have nothing but praise for the Australians."

Wu Ming said that the prominent families in the city were all scheming to get close to the Australians to get a piece of the pie.

The two talked for a long time. Seeing that it was getting late, Wu Ming took his leave.

"I have to go to the community school tomorrow. Brother Huang, please get some rest."

That night, Huang Binkun tossed and turned in bed, deeply feeling that Guangzhou was already like Lingao a few years ago. Except for flying the flag of the great Ming, the Cropped-Hair Bandits were everywhere. His dream of gathering anti-Cropped-Hair patriots here was just wishful thinking. Seeing that the travel money he had brought had been spent considerably during his time in Guangzhou, he had to decide on his next step. Continue north, to Fujian? To Nanzhi? Or go straight to the capital...

After the humid night, the morning in Guangzhou was cool and comfortable. While the habitually late-rising citizens were still asleep, Zhang Yu, the young master of Huifu Lane, slung his schoolbag over his shoulder and slowly strolled out of his family's ancestral walnut pastry shop. A few old men who were up early and setting up their stalls greeted him warmly, "Little Shrimp, off to school!" Zhang Yu returned their greetings one by one, leaving behind a chorus of praise, "So knowledgeable and polite. When will my Big Head ever learn to be like that?"

Fifteen-year-old Zhang Yu was studying at the Nanyu Community School. He was a good child in his parents' eyes and a good student in the mouths of his neighbors.
