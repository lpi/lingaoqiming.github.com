The moment the young woman vanished from the cabin, Boss Wang scrambled after her.

"Mistress Li," he began, his voice a low hiss, "what of his story?"

"A tapestry of truth and lies," Li Siya answered with a dismissive sniff. "Some threads we cannot pull without unraveling the whole cloth. For now, let him spin his yarn."

"A little pain would loosen his tongue. He would sing us any song we wished."

"Not here," she countered, her voice sharp. "The walls of a flower boat have a thousand ears. His first scream would bring the whole city down upon us. Find another place. Then you may ask your questions."

"At once, Mistress."

"Once you have what you need," she continued, her tone dropping to a silken whisper, "you and your brothers may do as you please. If you wish to leave a path for retreat, do not mark him too badly. But a cleaner solution is always best. No loose ends."

"I understand," Boss Wang murmured, the unspoken order hanging heavy in the air. Kill him.

"Send word to the usual place. I will be in Guangzhou for a time." She raised her voice slightly. "Let us go." A second figure, cloaked in black, detached itself from the shadows. The two of them stepped from the boat to the shore and were swallowed by the night.

Boss Wang watched them go, a long silence stretching before his men emerged from the cabin. "Boss, what now?"

He spat into the dark water, a sneer twisting his lips. "The fat is in our mouths, and she expects us to spit it out? Who is she but the Big Boss's errand girl?"

"But moving him..."

"Move him? To hell with that! What does that girl know of our work? Screams? We will pole this boat to a quiet stretch of the river, find a secluded bank, and take our time with him. We could try all Ten Great Tortures of the Ming Dynasty, and not a soul would hear."

"The Ten Great Tortures... is that a real thing?" one of the younger thugs asked, a look of genuine confusion on his face.

His companion shot him a glance. He knew the truth: Boss Wang was too cheap to pay for a new safe house and too fond of his companion on the boat. He wanted to keep the prize for himself.

Still, the point about prying eyes was valid. And Gao Ju was not a man to be trifled with. A little caution was in order.

"Hide him on Qingyan's skiff," he commanded. "Ma San, Little Zhao, you're on guard."

He then laid out his defenses, a web of hidden sentries. A Dan boatman, a master with a throwing knife, was positioned nearest the flower boat, his blades accurate to twenty paces. He could drop one or two attackers before they even set foot on the deck, buying time for the skiff to escape. For an attack from the water, he deployed his most valuable asset: an infantry archer, placed on the high stern of the flower boat. From that perch, he commanded a hundred-pace radius of water and shore.

*Let Master Gao come with his constables and his guards,* Boss Wang thought, a grim satisfaction settling over him. *They are nothing but fodder for a man who can shoot a willow leaf at a hundred paces.* The archer was a deserter, a man with a price on his head, but his skill was undeniable. He had cost a pretty penny, but the ransom would more than cover the expense.

Money, he thought, was the key. He gave each of the three sentries and two guards ten taels of silver upfront, with the promise of fifty more when the ransom was paid. Even the boat's bouncers received a share. A jolt of energy shot through the gang of rogues. They rubbed their hands together, their eyes gleaming with avarice.

As he was laying out his plans, the runner returned from Haopan Street. It was a system Boss Wang had instituted: two reports a day, morning and evening, on the movements at the Gao residence and the house of the sea merchants.

"Any news?"

"All quiet. The Gao residence is in a flurry, but they're preparing for a guest from the capital. No one has gone to the authorities. No one has gone to the escort agencies."

"And the Australians?"

"No movement. But..."

"What?"

"They've been setting off firecrackers all day."

"It's confirmed." Ran Yao stood before the large, improvised blackboardâ€”a rosewood table set on its side. "Our esteemed [Chairman Wen][y002] is being held on the fourth flower boat from the Hezi Embankment at White Goose Pool. The boat's name is 'Xuanzhu'."

The room was a stark contrast of centuries. A 19-inch LCD monitor glowed with a dozen camera feeds. On a nearby table, walkie-talkie chargers blinked like malevolent eyes. The floor was a chaotic nest of computer cases, battery packs, and tangled wires. The air was thick and hot. [Xiao Zishan][y001], on monitor duty, sat in a sweat-soaked undershirt, his eyes glued to the screens.

An enlarged digital photo was taped to the tabletop, showing a flower boat with a wide, flat bow and a high, raised stern. The boat was a confection of carved beams and painted rafters. A large oar for steering was at the back, with two smaller ones at the front for navigating the crowded waterways.

Ran Yao pointed to the photo. "All these boats have a bow cabin, a central cabin, and a stern section. The central cabin is the largest, draped for privacy. That's where they're holding him."

He summarized the intelligence gathered by the Qiwei Escort Agency. "The boat has had a 'Not Receiving Guests' sign posted since the twentieth of last month, claiming to be chartered. Over the past ten days, several men have been seen coming and going. They speak Cantonese, but with a Southern Fujianese accent.

"One man, a 'Boss Wang,' is the only one who stays the night. He leaves at dawn and returns at dusk.

"Three days ago, the day [Director Wen][y002] was taken, these men disappeared, but the 'chartered' sign remained, and the daily delivery of provisions did not decrease. Yesterday, one of the prostitutes on the boat was seen with a small, shiny object. From the description, we believe it was a nail clipper."

"A nail clipper?"

"A small one, with a 'Five Rams' plastic cover. From the list of missing items, it belongs to [Xiao Zishan][y001]."

He taped up another photo. "And this man, photographed near the boat two days ago, is the same man we saw in the teahouse on Haopan Street."

The intelligence from the escort agency had been their starting point. Ran Yao and Bei Wei, concealed within a sedan chair procession of Gao Ju's female relatives, had conducted their own surveillance, confirming every detail.

There was no time to waste. The ransom note had not yet arrived; the situation was stable. If the kidnappers moved their captive, finding him again would be nearly impossible. They would strike now.

Ran Yao would lead the operation, with the three members of the sports team and Lin Shenhe. The Qiwei Agency would provide support.

"Lin will provide sniper cover with the small-caliber rifle," Ran Yao explained. "The assault team will be split. My group will hit the boat from the embankment. Bei Wei's group will take a skiff and cut off their escape by water. Once we have [Wen][y002], the agency's carts will extract us from the embankment." They had ruled out a water retreat. The Dan were masters of the river; in a pursuit, the transmigrators would be at a disadvantage.

"The time is 17:30. The flower boats don't start their business until after 18:00. Before then, the light is good, and the embankment is quiet. After the operation, we'll be back inside the city walls before the gates close. If the bandit leader is outside the city, he'll be cut off. If he's inside, the news won't reach him in time. In an age where news travels at the speed of a running man, our walkie-talkies give us an insurmountable advantage."

"Why not after dark?" someone asked. "We have night vision."

"The gates," Ran Yao repeated. "We'd be trapped outside the city, fighting on their turf. And don't assume that 'night blindness' is as common in this era as we think."

The plan was set. They began their preparations. Anti-stab vests, inflatable life belts, steel helmets, goggles, combat boots. Hooded cloaks to conceal their modern gear. [Engineer Wang][y003] would remain at the residence, armed with a five-shot shotgun. [Xiao Zishan][y001] would be with the support team, their link through the walkie-talkie.

After lunch, Lin Shenhe laid out his Emei brand small-caliber rifle on a table. It was a model EM751, an excellent domestic sporting rifle. With its 4x scope, he was confident he could hit a man at 200 meters. But he had never fired this particular weapon. He needed to be sure.

Bei Wei watched him from the doorway as he meticulously cleaned the old but well-maintained rifle. He waited until Lin had reassembled it before speaking.

"Little Lin," he began, his voice hesitant, "about you being the sniper..."

"What? You think I can't handle it?" Lin Shenhe replied, not looking up as he shouldered the rifle, testing its balance.

"I know you've fired more guns in America than I've ever seen," Bei Wei said, choosing his words carefully. "But you've never been a soldier. A battlefield isn't a shooting range." He took a breath. "Logically, I should be the one on that rifle. But we're short-handed on the assault team."

"Don't worry," Lin Shenhe said, his voice flat. "Come. Watch me test it." He handed Bei Wei a pair of binoculars.

The test range was a narrow service alley, its high walls a natural shooting gallery. [Xiao Zishan][y001] had measured out fifty meters and taped a paper target to the far wall.

Lin Shenhe took a kneeling position, loaded a round, and engaged the safety. The chaotic popping of firecrackers from the courtyard provided a cacophony of cover. Through the scope, the black bullseye of the target swam into view, swaying with the minute vibrations of his body, the rhythm of his own pulse.

He held his breath. In the moment of stillness, he squeezed the trigger.

The recoil was negligible. Bei Wei raised the binoculars. The shot was on the paper, but it was a low-scoring ring. A miss at 200 meters.

Lin didn't move. He reloaded, fired again. Better. The third shot was better still.

Then, he settled. Three consecutive bullets tore through the paper, clustering tightly together. He made a minute adjustment to the sights. The next five shots were all in the 10-ring, a ragged hole in the center of the target.

"Good enough?" Lin Shenhe asked, his eyes on the remaining rounds in the box.

"Impressive," Bei Wei admitted. "But on the battlefield, you're shooting at people. Can you do it?"

A strange, cold smile touched Lin Shenhe's lips. "Why not? I hunt often."
