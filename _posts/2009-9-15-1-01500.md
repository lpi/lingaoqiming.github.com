"Then let's start with energy." [Xiao Zishan][y001] turned his head to the Energy Group. "Energy is the key to everything. As long as we have electricity, we can use any tool from modern machines to computers—these are all superior pieces of equipment that completely surpass the ancients. What is the Energy Group's view on our power supply problem?"

The person who stood up to speak from the Energy Group was [Chang Kaishen][y010]. As a temporary worker, he had been working in a subsidiary of a certain power group for five years, belonging to the category of people who do the most work, get the least pay, receive no credit, and take all the blame.

"According to the situation we will be facing, it is more appropriate to adopt a power strategy with hydropower as the mainstay, supplemented by thermal power and wind power.

"There are many benefits to hydropower, which I won't elaborate on here. For our team, the biggest benefit is that it doesn't require fuel replenishment. It's a one-time construction and can be used almost indefinitely.

"At present, rural small-scale hydropower equipment is quite simple, the installation difficulty is low, and the engineering investment is also very small. It uses an aqueduct for power generation, and can operate with a water head of 5-6 meters. The technology for this type of equipment is already very mature. Small and micro-sized units have been serialized and standardized in China, making maintenance convenient and the price very low.

"At the same time, we also need thermal power. The prime mover for thermal power can use various methods. Diesel generators are convenient to use, do not require installation, and are not restricted by the environment. They will be the main means of power generation we adopt in the early stages of landing."

At this point, someone raised their hand: "The diesel will run out one day, right? What do we do then?"

"Diesel engines can be easily modified for alternative products. I remember peanut oil can also be used," someone from the Energy Group said.

"Hehe, I don't know if peanut oil can be used, but diesel engines can be converted to gas engines." [Chang Kaishen][y010] thought for a moment, "When I was in the countryside, I saw many small power stations using gas engines. It shouldn't be difficult."

"I think we will be able to produce diesel in the future," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said. "Please continue."

"Alright," he continued, "Based on the attitude of not putting all our eggs in one basket, small and medium-power diesel generators, small hydropower, and small wind turbines are all needed. In addition, we need to bring some medium-power hydropower units for future expansion when we have sufficient engineering capabilities. As for wind turbines, although they have the problems of being too low in power and unstable in generation, they are simple to set up and are more suitable as backup power for living areas, independent strongholds, and systems."

He smiled: "Of course, electricity is not that simple. It also involves a series of issues such as transmission, distribution, and transformation. This is more professional, so I won't explain it. It will take a considerable amount of time to come up with a specific plan."

The next topic was also answered by the Energy Group, namely, the substitution of petroleum products. The transmigrators not only needed generators, but also motorcycles, cars, and small boats. Neither gasoline nor diesel could be stored for a long time. If they could not be self-sufficient in fuel, there was no need to bring too many of these things.

"Hehe, I dare not agree with the words of the meeting moderator," the next person to stand up and speak from the Energy Group was [Luo Duo][y011]. This person had posted numerous lengthy posts about energy during the online discussions. "But I heard that the moderator is a liberal arts student, which is understandable."

[Xiao Zishan][y001]'s face turned red. His biggest resentment was that "liberal arts student" had become a contemptuous evaluation. He suppressed his grief and indignation and pretended to be calm.

"Actually, what we are going to talk about is still a prime mover problem." [Luo Duo][y011] obviously did not feel the moderator's resentment. "Whether it's a ship, a car, or a motorcycle, they can all be driven by non-petroleum fuels, so the problem of petroleum substitutes is not an urgent problem for us to solve.

"Basically, prime movers that use petroleum-based fuels can be converted to be driven by gas engines. Of course, there will be a certain loss in power. However, at the end of World War II, the Germans experimentally installed gas generators on armored personnel carriers and tanks, so the power is still acceptable. The technology of gas generators is very simple and practical, and the difficulty of implementation is very low.

"Then we must not forget the steam engine. How many years have gasoline and diesel engines been around? The steam engine is the engine of the Industrial Revolution."

"Is there any place to buy steam engines now? Don't tell me you plan to have us build them," someone from the Mechanical Group said.

"You guys in machinery, isn't it easy to make a steam engine? That's a 19th-century product!" [Luo Duo][y011] retorted. "Our prime movers can't run on reserves forever. They will be consumed one day."

"We really haven't worked on steam engines before," the Mechanical Group whispered among themselves for a while, then [Ma Qianzhu][y005] stood up. "We all understand the principle of the steam engine, and there are many existing design materials. We are confident that we can build one. The boiler is the main difficulty. It depends on what kind of materials we can get, which depends on the level of the metallurgy department."

"Currently, the metallurgy department is also considered part of the Industrial Group," [Xiao Zishan][y001] explained. "I remember there are professionals in this field."

"That's right, we have a university student majoring in metallurgy." With that, several people burst into laughter, and a young man smiled embarrassedly.

"Your group should first coordinate a plan. Please continue."

"That's all I can think of for now." [Luo Duo][y011] seemed very excited and showed a hint of fatigue.

"Why not consider biodiesel?" someone asked. "There have been quite a few reports on this recently, and many countries have entered the practical stage."

"Yes, I remember there is a kind of kerosene tree in Hainan. The oil that flows out when you cut the bark can be used to light lamps."

"It can only be used to light lamps. It's not real kerosene," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said eloquently. "Biodiesel is not a simple technology. Although there are many kinds of oil crops that can be used as raw materials, including oil tea, tung oil tree, Chinese pistache, and bamboo tung, the oil produced cannot be directly used as diesel. It must undergo a series of modification treatments. In addition, no matter what kind of kerosene tree or other oil plant you have, just a few trees or a small grove is useless. Generally, this kind of planting base must be over a hundred mu to form an effective supply."

"By the way, I want to point out that the oil nanmu must grow to a diameter at breast height of 40-50 cm to produce oil. According to current findings, in Hainan, it only grows in areas like Sanya, Ledong, Dongfang, and Changjiang, where the water and temperature conditions are better than in Lingao and Danzhou," someone from the Agriculture Group spoke up.

"We can boil pine root oil. The Japanese did this during World War II. You don't need any special equipment to refine aviation gasoline."

"That's right, but the cost-effectiveness is too pitiful. The Japanese mobilized almost the entire population to refine only a few tens of thousands of barrels, and Hainan doesn't have that many pine roots for us to dig up."

"What about alcohol?" the biofuel party continued their efforts.

"It can be used as a substitute, but the calorific value of alcohol is too low, and there is the problem of engine carbon deposits. It is not an ideal substitute."

"Regarding the issue of substitutes for petroleum products, I have another point of view." Another person stood up. "My name is Zhong Lishi, and I am engaged in the design of oil shale retorting equipment. I once designed oil shale refining equipment for a refinery in Danzhou, Hainan.

"The city has rich oil shale reserves. The products from oil shale retorting can be further refined into various petroleum products. From this point of view, manufacturing gasoline and diesel is not a problem."

"Where is Danzhou?" someone below whispered.

"It's just to the west of Lingao. Very close."

"Then this resource is really not bad."

"Let me briefly introduce it. The Changpo oil shale has an oil content of 5.1% and is associated with lignite. The Changpo mine has two main ore bodies, with thicknesses of 6 meters and 44.5 meters respectively. The main mining method is open-pit mining.

"We can use the Maoming-style furnace for processing. The processing capacity is 50 tons of ore per furnace per day, with an oil recovery rate of 60%. Combined with the 5.1% oil content of the Changpo oil shale, each furnace can produce 1.5 tons of crude oil per day, not including by-products such as gasoline and ammonia.

"This kind of furnace does not require too many resources and manpower to build. To put into production a small plant with a daily processing capacity of 1600 tons, that is... 32 furnaces, plus 2 gas heating furnaces, 1 ventilation fan room, 2 washing towers, 2 cooling towers, and 2 chimneys—I have ready-made design drawings for all of these, and the equipment manufacturing difficulty is not high. Such a plant can obtain 48 tons of crude oil per day, as well as by-products such as gasoline, ammonia, coal gas, and phenol. All are very useful.

"The crude oil from oil shale is of very good quality and can be refined into high-quality diesel. Therefore, I believe that both diesel and gasoline engines can operate normally, without the need for any gas engines."

"1600 tons per day!" [Luo Duo][y011] jumped up. "Even if we all go and carry rocks, it won't be enough!"

"For an oil shale refinery, this is already a very small scale," Zhong Lishi said with the inscrutable smile of a high-level intellectual. "In reality, trains and belt conveyors are used for transportation. The design output of the oil plant I mentioned is not even as much as one set of equipment in a real-world shale oil plant. The oil plant I provided services to has several sets of refining equipment with even greater capacity than this. The processing capacity of one of their furnaces is 200 tons.

"If you think the oil yield of Changpo is too low, the oil shale produced in Huang County and Penglai in Shandong is of the best quality, with an oil content of up to 22%. If we still do not have the ability to exploit petroleum in ten or twenty years, we can consider taking over Shandong first."

The crowd below started whispering to each other again. Several people from the Sports Group were looking at a map of China.

"Let the Energy Group include this in the long-term plan. We'll see what level our manufacturing industry can reach," [Wen Desi][y002] spoke up. "Let's continue." He looked at [Xiao Zishan][y001], who nodded.
