"Stop! The gong's rhythm is off again! The string section is unsteady too!"

Nangong Hao let his baton fall limp—it was more for decoration than anything else, as the naturalized citizen musicians had yet to grasp what the conductor's gestures meant.

"Hey, I think we should take a break. It's so hot," said Okamoto, the director of the Lingao Central Experimental Art Troupe. His expression was grim, a stark contrast to the brilliant summer sun outside.

His partner, Deputy Director Dongfang Ke, leaned against the old Nie Er piano, fiddling with the black cord tying his hair back with his right hand while tapping on the piano case with his left. "It's obvious the musicians of this era aren't accustomed to polyphonic interplay. I doubt we can get a folk orchestra to perform upbeat music successfully."

At that moment, a sweat-drenched Nangong Hao stepped down from the makeshift conductor's podium of stacked wooden boxes, downed a glass of iced kvass in one go, and wiped his mouth. "Actually, that woman surnamed Liu and Wang Qisuo from the garrison are quite skilled. But it's a struggle for traditional folk musicians to even imitate the style we Elders prefer, let alone understand and master it. I've been working my tail off correcting them one by one! It's exhausting! It's not easy to create the atmosphere of an old-world gala with a folk ensemble. Oh, and there's still the issue of sound amplification and mixing for the large venue we talked about. If we don't want the cultural festival to sound like a funeral band, we need to figure something out."

The thought of that made Okamoto's face darken even more. He looked over at the girls from the Grid Skirt Club, who were gathering for their rehearsal. Their plaid miniskirts fluttered, complemented by new grey vests and red ribbons at their chests, and various flowers adorned their hair. They chattered away, brimming with youthful energy.

The thought that they wouldn't even have to sing for real—just dance to a backing track—made Okamoto's heart twist. Even if Liu Shuixin frowned at their dancing skills, they were at least at the level of high school hobbyists. The nerdy Elders would be mesmerized.

"Well, how about we just change the program to something like 'Colorful Clouds Chasing the Moon'? The style is closer to the southern aesthetic, and the rhythm is more relaxed, which would play to the strengths of our top string players."

Nangong replied, "We could, but wasn't the whole point of a folk ensemble to liven up the atmosphere and warm up the crowd? We need something like 'Joyful' at the very least! 'Colorful Clouds Chasing the Moon' and pieces like it don't fit the Senate's requirements for style!"

Dongfang Ke stood up straight and pointed at the piano. "Actually, for those revolutionary songs, a four-hand piano duet would be perfect. It's a much better opening act than this chaotic orchestra. For amplification, we can just place a microphone next to it. Then, Nangong, you can create a click track with a rhythm section on your computer to give it that modern pop-piano performance feel. Also, let's ask Ms. Liu from the Grid Skirt Club to come over for a moment. I'll ask if she remembers any simple teaching pieces. If not, I can play a solo; just need to add a backing track."

Nangong Hao agreed. "That's a good idea. Making an arrangement with various sound effects isn't hard. In fact, if you're used to a MIDI keyboard, you could just map the string and drum samples to different octaves and play them. Add a click track, and you've got a complete performance. What piece should we choose?"

Dongfang glanced out the window at the silhouette of the Executive Committee building in Bairen City, standing tall under the westward-slanting sun. When he turned back, a slight smile played on his lips. "Let's do 'Good News from Beijing Reaches the Frontier Villages.' Of course, we'll change it to 'Good News from Lingao Reaches the Li Villages.' To express the Li people's heartfelt love for the new Executive Committee, with [Wen Zong][y002] and [Ma Gong][y005] at its core, ha..." He finished with a rare, unrestrained smile.

Nangong Hao didn't seem to catch the sarcasm. He nodded. "The piece is cheerful and enthusiastic. The backing sounds like bells and horns are readily available in the sound library, so that's not difficult. We could even have the naturalized citizens play these simple instruments live for a more powerful effect. Let's settle on that for now."

Okamoto, on the other hand, was torn between laughter and tears but had to agree. "Alright, alright, that's the one. Let's wrap up today's rehearsal here. I'll go find Liu Shuixin." As he turned, he muttered under his breath, "That Dongfang... taking advantage of the fact that the Executive Committee doesn't know the song's background. What a vicious jab!" He suddenly frowned again. "I know this version. It's billed as a folk orchestra piece, but it's actually for a modern folk orchestra. The timpani, cello, and double bass are Western instruments. We don't have the instruments or the players for those..."

Nangong Hao said, "That's not a big problem. We can use an 88-key MIDI keyboard to play the sound samples in real-time. An 88-key keyboard can be split into three zones: one for the timpani, one for the cello, and one for the double bass. Also, if we can't find a low brass instrument like a horn, we'll need to play that sound with the MIDI keyboard as well. We can edit the sampling software to assign the three instrument sounds to different octaves on one keyboard. This might require two or three people playing the same keyboard, each responsible for one or two sounds. Of course, if the Planning and Enterprise Department has more MIDI keyboards in their warehouse, it would be even easier. Right now, we only have the one I brought, and I think there's another one in the recording studio—but I doubt we can borrow it."

"I don't think those bast—" Okamoto quickly swallowed the word, remembering he would have to beg the Planning and Enterprise Department for resources later. "—would have thought that far ahead."

This wasn't just speculation. There were almost no artists in the Senate's core leadership. For them, remembering to bring some musical instruments and recording equipment was already a great feat.

"Not necessarily a MIDI keyboard," Nangong Hao said. "Electric pianos, electronic organs, and synthesizers can all be used as MIDI keyboards."

Dongfang nodded. "Not many people might have electric pianos, but someone probably brought an electronic organ. We can post on the forum and see. If we have enough keyboardists and equipment, we can simulate any kind of band. Of course, the sound of sampled instruments played on a keyboard will have subtle differences from real instruments. As for the bells and clappers in the piece—those should be easy to find. If not, we can make them. They're simple to play; any percussionist from an opera troupe could handle it."

"I'll post on the forum right now!" Okamoto said eagerly.

"No rush. Let Nangong transcribe the score from the original orchestral recording and prepare the sound samples first. You go and submit the report to secure the equipment. The two of us will discuss the arrangement," Dongfang said, his expression returning to its usual stoicism.

"That schedule is probably too tight. I have to create a new arrangement for the Grid Skirt Club girls tonight. They're waiting to go into the recording studio," Nangong Hao said, looking exhausted. More than ten days of continuous rehearsals, where he had to be the composer, arranger, conductor, and music teacher, had left him physically and mentally drained.

"What?!" Before Dongfang could speak, Okamoto's face contorted with frustration. "You're actually..."

"Pop music is a form of art too," Nangong Hao said, clearly not sharing the "us versus them" mentality of the troupe's directors.

"Forget it, Okamoto. The Grid Skirt Club girls have been working hard. We should at least give them a chance to perform," Dongfang Ke said, his attitude towards the idol group having softened. Watching them progress from clumsy, mechanical imitation to being able to complete several dances with a degree of expressiveness was a completely different experience from just watching a finished performance from the audience.

He sat down at the piano, his fingers flying across the keys in a passionate melody, while Nangong Hao went to help the folk orchestra pack up their instruments.

While the art troupe was wrestling with performance issues, the bigwigs of the Grid Skirt Club were facing their own dilemma.

Their concerns were identical to Okamoto's: the live sound amplification and mixing equipment had not yet been secured.

Wu Ciren had already received a "lecture" from Liu Shuixin on the importance of this equipment. Their debut performance wasn't in the small, hundred-seat theater they had envisioned, but in the massive stadium.

In such a venue, without amplification, only a professionally trained opera singer—one who could open their mouth wide, lower their larynx, expand their pharynx, clear their nasal passages, and use their entire body as a "human resonance chamber" to amplify the vibrations of their vocal cords—could make themselves heard.

Forget their fledgling idol group of amateur singers; even a professionally trained vocalist like Liu Shuixin couldn't perform here without a microphone.

Since the advent of microphones and speakers, singers no longer needed to generate immense volume with their bodies; volume was now determined by the power of the speakers. This paved the way for the global popularity of pop singing—a more natural, intimate style of vocalization that resonated more easily with listeners.

This, combined with advances in recording technology, created the fertile ground for idol-type stars to thrive.

No matter how low the bar was for an idol's "singing ability," they at least had to be audible! They had to sound "pretty good" to attract fans.

Therefore, after a few vocal training sessions, the gentlemen of the Grid Skirt Club had abandoned the idea of a live performance—even though the amplification equipment was mostly secured. They didn't even consider a semi-live performance, fully committing to the decision to "lip-sync."

For idols with no vocal foundation and insufficient training, performing live would be a challenge even with microphones.
