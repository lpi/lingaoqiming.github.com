Chang Qingyun gave a bitter smile. "Let's not beat around the bush. Last night, the Viceroy's yamen received a report from Gaoyao County saying that a captain named Cao was causing trouble outside the city with dozens of men and had gotten into a conflict with the Jinyiwei. Governor Xiong was afraid that if the two sides reached a stalemate, it would be embarrassing for everyone, so he sent me here in a hurry to mediate. Before I even reached the wharf, I heard the sound of repeating firearms. Then, that group of soldier-thugs fled back to the city like a flock of scattered ducks. I knew immediately—having escaped with my life from the midst of an army, I am all too familiar with the sound of repeating firearms. In all of Liangguang, only the chiefs have the power to so easily dispatch dozens of soldiers with a single boat."

Suo Pu nodded. Chang Qingyun had both established a connection and flattered them. It seemed his time in the Lin'gao prisoner-of-war camp had not been wasted.

"I immediately reported back to Governor Xiong, saying that Baihu Lin of the Jinyiwei and his party were numerous and highly skilled in martial arts, and had already dealt with those dozens of grunts. However, this Cao is no pushover. He has likely stationed men along the waterways both upstream and downstream, waiting for you, and will not let this matter rest. Therefore, Governor Xiong sent me here early this morning with two options: either you show magnanimity and hand the woman over to Captain Cao, in which case Governor Xiong is willing to offer five hundred taels of silver; or you exercise a little forbearance, disguise yourselves, and I will have my men guide you back to the provincial capital via mountain paths, leaving the empty boat behind." Chang Qingyun finished with a self-deprecating smile. "But I'm afraid the chiefs will not agree to either of these conditions."

Suo Pu laughed. "Since you know we have repeating firearms, you can forget about handing over the person or fleeing."

He then asked, "Do you know who that woman is?"

"I do not."

"She was formerly the concubine of the Guangdong Censor, Gao Shunqin," Suo Pu said. "In a way, she is one of your own kind. Having fallen to such a state, even if we don't save her from the fire and water, it would be wrong to push her back into the fire, wouldn't it?"

Chang Qingyun said, "She is just a mere woman, and a concubine at that."

Suo Pu felt a secret contempt. He saw Chang Qingyun look up at him. "Captain Cao is a small matter. Forgive my boldness, but for a chief of your stature to come to Zhaoqing in person, I fear that Zhaoqing, and indeed all of Liangguang, will soon suffer an undeserved military disaster."

With a "swish," Lin Ming immediately drew his Embroidered Spring Saber and blocked the cabin exit. Xie Peng also drew his revolver.

Chang Qingyun did not turn his head. "Chief, although I do not understand military affairs, I know that Zhaoqing cannot withstand a single blow from the Great Song's army. But as a man who has been disgraced by defeat in battle, I have received great kindness from Governor Xiong and have no way to repay it. If Baihu Lin grants my wish, to be buried here today would be a final act of loyalty to Governor Xiong. But for the sake of the people of Liangguang, I wish to say one more thing. If the chief can listen before acting, I will die without regret."

"Speak," Suo Pu said. "You know the policy."

"Yes." Chang Qingyun seemed to have returned to the days of a shaven head and coarse cloth clothes, when he was called "9763." "Governor Xiong has long admired..." He seemed to be choosing his words carefully. "The style of you chiefs—"

"What? Old Xiong wants to treat us to a meal?" Cummins interjected.

Suo Pu smiled. "Old Xiong's hospitality has already been extended. Stop stammering. Just say it. What message does Old Xiong want you to deliver?"

Chang Qingyun composed himself, and his speech became fluent. "Governor Xiong has long praised everything about Lin'gao, calling you all gentlemen of 'benevolence and virtue,' by no means ordinary merchants..."

Suo Pu understood immediately. This was an offer of pacification. He listened patiently.

"...You are all descendants of Huaxia, of the same bloodline as the Yan and Huang Emperors. To return to the motherland by crossing ten thousand miles of waves in iron ships is an act of loyalty worthy of praise. If you can lay down your arms and serve the court, your future will be as bright as brocade..."

Chang Qingyun had indeed brought a message of pacification! Suo Pu thought this was not surprising. Xiong Wencan had made his career by pacifying "great bandits." As the largest "sea pirates" in Liangguang, it was impossible for him not to have this idea.

He had originally planned to reorganize the military affairs of Liangguang before proceeding slowly, but the conflict at the wharf yesterday had forced him to advance his plans. True Kun were not uncommon in Guangzhou; several of them moved about openly in the city, interacting with officials and merchants. But this was Zhaoqing, a strategic military point in Liangguang. For a True Kun to travel so far into this territory, their intentions were obvious.

Xiong Wencan's abilities were limited, but he was self-aware. In the past, he couldn't even subdue Zheng Zhilong with the resources of a single province, let alone the Kunzei, who were more than ten times stronger than Zheng Zhilong and had taken over Hainan!

The matter of the Kunzei couldn't be hidden forever. For now, the court was overwhelmed by the eastern barbarians and the roving bandits and couldn't be bothered with Hainan. But once the court caught its breath, there would have to be an explanation.

Xiong Wencan knew well that the court was rotten to the core. The emperor wanted to govern diligently but lacked the strength—or rather, he was applying his strength in the wrong places. Xiong Wencan understood the art of officialdom. He knew that to survive in the court, he could not follow the emperor in "governing diligently." That would only make things worse. Moreover, with the country in increasing difficulty, the emperor was impatient for success and had a volatile temperament. If there was any mishap, he was not a monarch known for his tolerance...

The only way was to gloss things over as much as possible. As long as no major incidents occurred during his tenure, he could continue his official career in peace.

The fall of Zheng Zhilong was a huge blow to him. Although he had used the Zheng Zhilong group with the attitude of "using bandits to fight bandits," Zheng Zhilong had been very diligent in eliminating other pirates after being pacified. It could be said they had achieved a "win-win" situation. Xiong Wencan's promotion to Viceroy of Liangguang was largely due to Zheng Zhilong's "performance."

The fall of Zheng Zhilong also meant that the Kunzei had become the largest "great bandit" on the southeast coast, completely bankrupting Xiong Wencan's previous strategy of "using bandits to control bandits" and letting the sea lords of Fujian and Guangdong check each other. The Kunzei, as a rising power, had not only easily destroyed Zheng Zhilong's main force but had also forced Liu Xiang's men to surrender. Xiong Wencan had almost reached a pacification agreement with Liu Xiang, but it was sabotaged by the Kunzei fleet's several armed demonstrations in Chaoshan.

Thus, the Kunzei, the largest maritime power in Liangguang, became Governor Xiong's primary concern. He had learned a lot about the situation in Hainan from merchants who had been to Lin'gao and had also sent spies there. The results were a mix of good and bad news.

The bad news was that the Kunzei were already like a rival state in Hainan, openly calling themselves the Great Song, levying taxes, and training troops without restraint. The court's yamen and officials were mere decorations. The most crucial point was that the Australians' huge appetite was somewhat frightening to him.

By "huge appetite," he didn't mean "becoming emperor"—such slogans were not worth mentioning. It was common for a few hundred poor peasants to take up their hoes in a famine year and shout "the emperor's throne is taken in turns, next year it will be my family's turn," and no one took it seriously.

The problem was that this group of Australians had the power but were in no hurry to do so. According to Xiong Wencan's experience, any group that could raise several thousand men and capture a few county towns would have its leader declare himself king, if not emperor, immediately. Yet the Kunzei, with tens of thousands of men and the largest fleet on the southeast coast, did nothing of the sort. They even let the court's officials continue to idle in their yamens. This made Xiong Wencan hesitate: "build high walls, store up grain, and be slow to claim the title of king" was the founding principle of the current dynasty's founder.

The good news was that although the Kunzei were entrenched in Hainan, effectively a separate state, they still paid their taxes, and court orders could be transmitted. This indicated that the Kunzei had no intention of rebelling and establishing their own state yet, and pacification was still possible.

If he could pacify the Kunzei, it would be a great relief for the already beleaguered court. Guangdong, as one of the court's few sources of revenue, could not afford any more turmoil. By pacifying the region, he would have achieved a great merit.

Of course, with Xiong Wencan's insight, he knew very well that this group of Kunzei was not something that could be contained by high office or generous salaries. Sooner or later, they would raise the banner of rebellion—but that would be at least a few years later, and by then, he might no longer be in charge of military affairs in Liangguang.

So he decided to pacify this "great bandit" at any cost, in exchange for a period of peace. As for the future, that was a matter for the future.

The terms of pacification proposed by Chang Qingyun were very generous: as long as they accepted pacification, the court would establish the position of Vice-General of Qiongshan in Hainan. Wen Desi or Ma Qianzhu would be appointed Vice-General, or if they were unwilling, another True Kun could be designated. The Guangdong government would issue a one-time reward of thirty thousand taels of silver to the Fubo Army. One thousand men from the Fubo Army could be enlisted as official soldiers, with their salaries paid monthly by the court. The Australians could continue to be stationed in Hainan, and apart from the required taxes, the appointment of local officials, and the postal relay system, the government would not interfere in other matters. As for the Australians' entry and exit from Guangzhou, they could do so freely.

Suo Pu thought, *Good heavens, this is a complete recognition of the existing reality!* It was a thorough legitimization. He knew very well that a few years ago, these terms might have been negotiable. But now, Hainan was like outgrown clothes for the developing Senate. The inherent bottlenecks of industrial development in Hainan were beginning to show, and the Senate was determined to take Guangdong. Under these circumstances, he doubted anyone would be interested in discussing pacification.

Suo Pu shook his head slightly. "Although I cannot decide this matter alone, I'm afraid the Senate can only appreciate Governor Xiong's kind intentions in spirit."

Chang Qingyun had been in Lin'gao and was not surprised by this outcome. But Suo Pu's statement made his heart sink. He said with a trembling voice, "Does this mean the Senate intends to..."

Suo Pu nodded. "Since Governor Xiong has offered us a quince, we shall naturally repay him with a precious jade. Mr. Chang, please convey this to Governor Xiong: Liangguang is not only hot, but also full of miasma, not a peaceful place for an official to reside. Furthermore, I have heard that the celestial phenomena in Guangdong this year are unusual, and there may be a great snow and severe cold, the likes of which have not been seen in a hundred years. We pray that His Excellency will be safe and sound in all matters and receive further promotions."

Chang Qingyun nodded. "I understand. Thank you for the kind wishes of the chiefs."
