The meeting lasted for almost a whole day, ending only after dark. There were still many matters to be resolved—specifically, the details of operations and planning—but at least they had reached a preliminary division of labor, established a rough framework, and determined the direction of the preparation work. Everyone also had a general idea of what needed to be done.

Even so, a sense of excitement filled everyone's heart. The committee had made it clear that no discussion about the transmigration was allowed outside the office building, but in reality, the small groups of people strolling along the weed-strewn running track of the sports field were still talking in low voices about the meeting and their different opinions. Among them, there were also some like-minded people who were strengthening their bonds through conversation—of course, mainly by venting their dissatisfaction.

The reasons for dissatisfaction were varied: the development direction of a certain industry, a certain equipment list, or perhaps just someone's appearance. But as long as there was dissatisfaction, it would increase the intimacy between people, and there was no matter in this world that everyone could be satisfied with. Minor dissatisfactions began to accumulate from the very beginning of the enterprise.

The Executive Committee, immersed in the atmosphere of a "successful congress, a congress of unity, a congress of victory," was naturally unaware of this. At this moment, the members of the Executive Committee were having a secret talk with the core members of the Sports Group.

The so-called Sports Group, although it was currently responsible for the physical training of the transmigrators, was in substance the embryonic form of the future violent apparatus of the transmigrators. It was only given such a harmless name to deceive the public.

Throughout the entire meeting, the Sports Group basically made no statements. In fact, this was a heads-up that [Wen Desi][y002], one of the three heads of the Executive Committee, had given them before the meeting. The scope of the Sports Group's business was too sensitive to be discussed openly, even among the core personnel of the transmigrators.

The current leader of the Sports Group was a sales manager—of course, he did not become the leader of the Sports Group because of this profession. He was a former officer in the army, a graduate of an infantry school, had served as a company commander in a field unit, and had also worked as a staff officer in the headquarters. He was the best military asset the transmigrators currently had.

He had a very awesome name: Xi Yazhou (席亚洲 - Xi Rolls Through Asia).

Xi Yazhou and his colleagues in the Sports Group were mostly demobilized and transferred military personnel. There were not many of them, but the military bearing brought by their military experience could still be clearly felt.

"[Chief Wen][y002], this is Bei Wei, formerly of the XX Military Region Reconnaissance Brigade."

"This is Wu De, formerly of the XX Naval Garrison District."

"This is He Ming," Xi Yazhou introduced the oldest one with a hint of reverence, "he once participated in the Two Mountains Border War as an infantry company commander and was decorated for his service in battle..."

This introduction made everyone present stand in awe. This old comrade, nearly fifty, had dark skin, slightly graying short hair, and sat with his back ramrod straight.

Hearing Xi Yazhou's introduction, He Ming waved his hand: "Little Xi, what's the point of saying all this! What's there to brag about a soldier fighting a war?"

*It seems there are still many honest people among the older generation of soldiers,* [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought.

"Most of the transmigrators are laymen when it comes to military affairs," [Wen Desi][y002] chose his words carefully. "Many people have a lot of deep knowledge about weapons, equipment, and military theory, but it's all on paper. There aren't many who have actually served in the army and handled a gun. So I want to hear the thoughts of the Sports Group. You are the professionals, after all."

"Well, I want to first confirm roughly how many people will participate in the transmigration. What is the proportion of demobilized and transferred military personnel and core militia?"

"It's hard to say at the moment. In the end, there may be five to six hundred people. There are about ten more people with the qualifications you mentioned."

"Then we still have to take the route of making every citizen a soldier," Xi Yazhou said. "Such a population base cannot sustain a specialized armed force of any significant size." He paused for a moment. "Fourteen people, even if they are all Rambos, are not enough. We need to conduct comprehensive military training. Everyone must participate."

"Even the women?"

"Yes, even the women, but that [Auntie Tian][y110] doesn't need to. Men of all ages, and women under forty."

"What will the training be?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] wondered if it would be the same content as university military training.

"We will set a training plan for this." Xi Yazhou thought for a moment. "After all, the environment we will be facing is completely different. So the subjects need to be revised. The preliminary plan is drill, simple earthwork, disassembly and assembly and live-fire shooting of one long and one short light weapon, and simple fighting techniques."

"First, we will form a small team of 15-20 people, mainly composed of veterans, to be responsible for early warning and reconnaissance work—this will be our standing army. The Sports Group will then recruit some young people with better physical conditions for more comprehensive military training. The scale will be about fifty people, as the core militia."

"These people cannot be taken away from production."

"Of course," Xi Yazhou said, "that's why they are called the core militia. They will just have more training content and will serve as the backbone force in battle."

"What about the time?"

"Basic training is thirty days, and ninety days for the core militia. If there are good prospects, I would like to train them continuously until the transmigration." Xi Yazhou calculated with a pencil. "In addition, physical training must be carried out continuously—at least long-distance running every day. The Sports Group will be specially responsible for these things. It's just that we need to find another place for weapons disassembly and live-fire training. Are there many shooting clubs here?"

"It seems there is one in this county, specifically to attract people from Hong Kong to play."

"That's good. It's a pity that guns are not easy to get." Xi Yazhou sighed. "And the ammunition in the club is too expensive. We can only let everyone get a feel for it, we can't really train anything."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] shifted uncomfortably. He had a premonition that they were about to discuss some extremely sensitive issues. For a moment, he thought about whether he should excuse himself to go to the toilet and slip away.

"The problem of weapons is indeed very difficult. This thing is too sensitive."

"Can we get real guns?" [Wang Luobin][y003] hadn't given up hope. Although he claimed to have made N guns, these were after all made of ordinary steel, and there was a huge difference from the guns that came out of a real arsenal.

Modern firearms use a wide variety of materials, with more than ten different types of steel alone.

"It's possible," Xi Yazhou knew a little about this. "But it's better not to think about it. The possibility of something going wrong is very high."

"Then we can only count on the Industrial Group to build them themselves," [Wang Luobin][y003] was a little disappointed.

"Are we going to build them in this time-space?"

"We have the equipment, the talent, and the materials are not difficult to buy. The things we make will be no worse than those made in Hualong."

[Wen Desi][y002] shook his head repeatedly: "This is too dangerous. Illegal firearms are a key target for crackdowns. If we really do it, the police will come knocking in a few days."

"Then what do we do? We have no way to get weapons."

"How about trading some 'dogs' (airsoft guns) for some real iron at a shooting club?" someone had a wild idea.

"You might as well just go and steal from the People's Armed Forces Department!" [Xiao Zishan][y001] had to strongly object.

"[Chief Wen][y002], how many weapons can we get now? Give me the bottom line, so I have an idea."

[Wen Desi][y002] hesitated for a moment. At present, even hiding an airsoft gun could lead to legal trouble, let alone real firearms. But Xi Yazhou was the future military backbone, and this show of trust was necessary.

"There are very few items." [Wen Desi][y002] never wrote down these numbers in a notebook or laptop; he memorized them all.

Currently, they could confirm a total of more than ten shotguns of different brands, calibers, and models. There were old-fashioned single-shot shotguns, as well as the five-shot pump-actions that often appeared in social news. The calibers were 12, 16, and 20 gauge. They were all old domestic brands, such as Pigeon, Eagle, Flying Dragon, and Double Ring. They were all leftovers from past hunting enthusiasts. The accessories such as shells, primers, and bullet loaders were complete, but the guns were generally old, some even with a history of more than thirty years.

What could truly be considered rifles were two Emei brand small-caliber sporting rifles. The guns were in good condition, with a full set of accessories such as competition sights, and a small amount of ammunition.

There was also one unbranded East German-made rifled hunting gun that used an 8x57mm cartridge. There were a few casings, but no ammunition.

In addition, there were several Shanghai brand and Gongzi brand Type 64 air rifles, one of which was a competition gun with a sight.

"Not a single real gun," someone was rather disappointed.

"It's pretty good. Shotgun pellets can reach 35 meters, and with slugs, the range is 70 meters. It's not inferior to a flintlock, and it's more than a generation ahead of a matchlock. And our rate of fire is our advantage." Xi Yazhou was clearly not disappointed with these miscellaneous weapons. "The small-caliber sporting rifle has good accuracy and a sight. It can be used as a sniper rifle to suppress important enemy targets at long range. I remember that the effective range of a small-caliber rifle can definitely reach 200 meters."

"The lethality isn't great, is it? The enemy will most likely be in full armor."

"How can there be so much armor? Just a tattered uniform jacket."

"That's the Manchus. Our Great Ming is not so shabby..."

Just as someone was about to start arguing about the armor issue and was about to senselessly drag it into a Ming-fan-versus-Qing-hater debate, a quiet voice came from the corner of the wall:

"Just shoot them in the head."

It was Bei Wei—a stocky former reconnaissance soldier who had been sitting there with a blank expression since the beginning of the meeting. At this moment, everyone shivered.

Xi Yazhou nodded: "What kind of equipment level the enemy has, this needs to be researched by the history enthusiasts. The Intelligence Group needs to give us a table of the military strength of all forces in the late Ming Dynasty: including their respective combat effectiveness, weapons and equipment, tactics and methods, classic battle examples, and so on. This way we can make targeted plans."

"No problem," the people from the Intelligence Group immediately agreed.

Then everyone went over the details again. The matter of weapons was rather complicated, and they decided to do some intelligence gathering first before considering a solution.
