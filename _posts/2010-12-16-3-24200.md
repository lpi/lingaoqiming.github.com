Zhou Botao's subordinates proposed a simple and crude method: drug Zhou Qi, stuff him into Qiuhong's bed, and then lead Chen Minggang to the scene. Although it seemed crude, it was guaranteed to be effective. Even if Chen Minggang knew it was a setup, he would have to dismiss Zhou Qi to save face.

However, this method had significant drawbacks. Chen Minggang would immediately know that someone was targeting him, which would arouse his suspicion. Moreover, after a field survey, Zhou Botao felt it wouldn't be easy. There were six or seven of Chen Minggang's men guarding Qiuhong's residence, and four or five servants in the courtyard. Too many people were involved. And Chen Minggang was no fool.

It was also difficult to act outside. According to the surveillance reports, Qiuhong rarely went out. Chen Minggang didn't allow her to go out much in the first place. She wasn't a local and had no acquaintances in the county to visit. Lingao was a small place without even a decent temple—she didn't even have the opportunity for the common leisure activity of ancient women, visiting temples to burn incense.

With her hiding away like this, there was nothing they could do. They couldn't get in, and they couldn't get her out. Unable to think of a better method, Zhou Botao could only have the special propaganda group continue to spread rumors.

Zhou Qi himself was completely unaware. After the autumn levy began, he was extremely busy. Chen Minggang had assigned most of the tasks to him. Zhou Qi also felt this was a sign of his master's trust. He had been anxious about Qiuhong being beaten, but now, feeling that he had not lost his master's favor, he was half-relieved.

Although they were using the "land survey" as a pretext this year, his master had already told them the bottom line: the key was to "negotiate terms" with the large households.

"Our own benefits, that's the first thing to discuss," Chen Minggang instructed him. "But you must also handle the Australians well. The previously under-reported, concealed, and fraudulently entrusted lands—you have to make the large households spit some of it out for this matter to be settled."

As for how much each family would spit out, although the specific amount was subject to negotiation, Chen Minggang had also prepared a list with a bottom line. Each family had to report some land based on their scale; trying to get away with not reporting a single mu by paying money was absolutely not an option.

Chen Minggang knew very well that to borrow the Australians' power, he had to produce some real results. Relying solely on bribes would not work with the Australians.

Zhou Qi understood his master's intentions well. So, for the past few days, he had been busy running around the countryside, basically spending his time negotiating terms with people.

Of course, the task was not easy. The conditions Chen Minggang proposed were harsh: not only did each family have to report some concealed land, but the amount of wastage rice was also increased. In the past, some households didn't pay wastage rice or paid less. This time, Chen Minggang was uncompromising, resolutely demanding they pay their full share.

"If we don't squeeze them hard now, we might not have such a good opportunity in the future," Chen Minggang instructed him. "Don't be afraid to speak harshly or make threats. With the Australian masters backing us, what are you afraid of? We're not afraid of making a scene—Dang Na Men was so arrogant, wasn't his head hung on the city gate?!"

Although that was what he said, Zhou Qi was unwilling to do it that way. The master was the master, and he was himself. It was still uncertain whether he could become a yamen clerk in the future—from the current situation, it seemed he had no hope. Chen Minggang had three sons, the eldest of whom was already twenty. The master was not that old and could work for another ten years without a problem. By then, he would naturally pass the position to his own son. Who knew what attitude this "junior brother" would have towards him then!

He was not an official clerk; in the end, he was just an unofficial "black person." The ancients also valued "official positions." Adhering to the principle of "more friends, more paths," Zhou Qi was still very polite to the large households and always made it clear beforehand: this was arranged by "the higher-ups," not his own idea.

"I am also acting against my will," he would always say with a smile to the large households. "You see, I'm thirty and don't even have a wife. I'm just trying to make a living. I must ask you masters to be considerate!"

This was just a hint to everyone: I'm not the one getting the benefits. The one who started the trouble is the one to blame.

Liu Family Village.

"So, we have to report a few more mu to pass?" Liu Guangbiao asked.

Liu Youren had let Liu Guangbiao represent the Liu family to negotiate with Zhou Qi, so that if the talks broke down, there would still be room for maneuver.

"That's right," Zhou Qi nodded affirmatively. "The Australians want to conduct a land survey; they can't just make thunder without rain. We have to give them some face."

"Hmm, that makes sense." Liu Guangbiao stared intently at Zhou Qi, trying to read his expression, but Zhou Qi remained all smiles and obsequiousness.

"Old Qi, just name your price. How much will it cost?" Liu Guangbiao asked.

"Let's not rush the price. Please, Third Master Liu, let me know how much the Liu Family Village plans to report." The amount reported directly affected the private fees. This detail could not be mistaken.

Zhou Qi had the list Chen Minggang had given him. He had handled tax collection for the Liu Family Village in the past and knew that their registered taxable land was less than four hundred mu, while Liu Youren actually owned over two thousand mu.

"How about a total of five hundred mu of taxable land?"

"Master Liu, you know better than I do how much land you have under your name," Zhou Qi said slowly. "Besides, for such a large piece of land in Jialaiyang, you can't just say it's five hundred mu—the Australian chiefs aren't fools."

Liu Guangbiao understood that reporting a mere one or two hundred mu would not be enough. He said, "Old Qi, you mean—"

"At least half, one thousand two hundred mu."

"One thousand two hundred mu!" Liu Guangbiao acted as if he were terrified. "How is that possible? That's too... too..."

"Third Master Liu!" Zhou Qi's tone became heavy. "Don't feel bad. If you have this half, you still have the other half. If you think you're reporting too much, the Australians might come down to the countryside to survey it themselves—by then, I'm afraid every bit of land will be recorded..."

Liu Guangbiao knew this was an exorbitant demand, waiting for him to bargain. He thought for a moment:

"Just name your price. What's the biggest reduction you can give?"

The two sides haggled for a while and finally settled on a price: the Liu Family Village would report an additional two hundred and thirty mu, bringing the total taxable land to just over seven hundred mu. As for the wastage rice, they agreed that this year it would be three dou and three sheng per shi of standard tax—an increase, as the Liu Family Village had previously only paid one dou and two sheng. One dou of the newly added portion was Chen Minggang's "private fee." This amount was also unprecedented.

After seeing Zhou Qi off, Liu Youren, who had been listening from the back hall, strolled out. Liu Guangbiao hurried to greet him:

"Third Uncle! What do you think—"

"It's fine. you handled it well," Liu Youren sighed. Although Zhou Qi's tone was deferential, Chen Minggang's group's appetite was truly enormous this year. In the past, a bribe of ten or eight taels of silver would have been enough. This time, they not only added wastage rice and reported concealed land, but they even dared to include their private fees in the wastage rice!

"This group of Australians is truly harmful!" Liu Guangbiao said with hatred. "In the past, Chen Minggang would never have dared to be so audacious!"

"Hmm." Liu Youren said nothing. He now fully understood. The so-called land survey was probably indeed the Australians' idea, but it had been exploited by Chen Minggang and turned into a tool for his extortion and profit. Otherwise, it would be impossible to force everyone to report some concealed land, and reporting too little wouldn't be acceptable—Chen Minggang knew the Australians couldn't be easily fooled; he had to show some real results.

He just found it strange. Why did the Australians let Chen Minggang and his group run wild? With their abilities, couldn't they conduct the land survey themselves with more precision and without disturbing the people...

Liu Youren suddenly thought, if the Australians did conduct the land survey themselves, how could a large household like his engage in any tricks? They would probably have to report every bit of land honestly. In that sense, having a parasite like Chen Minggang around was somewhat beneficial.

However, the feeling of being extorted lingered in his heart.

"To think we have to yield to such a petty person!" he said resentfully. It seemed that to avoid being bullied, he had to get in touch with the Australians directly. If even Chen Minggang wasn't afraid to collude with the Australians and openly work for them, what did he, a country squire with a purchased imperial student title, have to fear?

"When Chief Xun comes, you must entertain him well," he instructed Liu Guangbiao. "Build a good relationship with him and tell him about this matter."

"Yes, nephew understands!"

"And about Meilan, you must also put more thought into it. I was thinking, when Chief Xun comes this time, let Meilan serve him..." He stopped, thinking it was too absurd. Meilan was not a maid; he couldn't just push her onto someone like that. It would only make the other party look down on them.

"Nephew will figure something out," Liu Guangbiao understood.

"Did her father agree?"

"To be able to curry favor with the Australian master, her father would be overjoyed." Of course, Liu Youren knew his nephew was talking nonsense and had probably used some threats and inducements. But it didn't matter: Liu Meilan's family was insignificant in the clan; no one would care about their thoughts.

"When we distribute the sacrificial rice at the end of the year, give her family a little more," Liu Youren said. "Meilan's dowry when she marries will also be paid for by the public funds. Let her marry in style."

"Third Uncle is very considerate!" Liu Guangbiao smiled. "Not only can her family be given more, but all the branches can get more sacrificial rice this year. This year's harvest is really good. Better than the neighboring families! Master's decision to join the Heaven and Earth Society was truly the right move."

At the mention of the harvest, Liu Youren's mood finally lightened a little: thankfully, this year's harvest was not bad!

First, it was a rare year of favorable weather with no major disasters. Second, after joining the Heaven and Earth Society, Chief Xun had indeed been very dedicated, using many methods to help them with their farming. Some methods he found not particularly strange, while others were incredible. The paddy fields had now been drained and were drying. Although Liu Youren was a landlord, he was very knowledgeable about farming. He saw that this year's rice ears not only had more branches but were also generally very heavy. He casually picked one and counted; not only were there many more grains than before, but there were also very few empty or shriveled husks.
