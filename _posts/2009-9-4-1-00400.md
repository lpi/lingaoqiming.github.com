"Damn, that was like a roller coaster ride," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said in a low voice, still shaken.

"Fortune is sought in danger," [Wang Luobin][y003] said, his hand still in his pocket. [Xiao Zishan][y001] knew he had been gripping the stun gun the whole time.

"What are you talking about? Calm down, calm down." [Chief Wen][y002] also had beads of sweat on his nose.

The reasonably well-thought-out transmigration plan had gone wrong from the very beginning. Just as [Wen Desi][y002] had put the wormhole exit into his bag, they heard the frantic barking of dogs, which scared the three of them so much their legs went soft, and they panicked. Fortunately, [Wang Luobin][y003] had been holding the stun gun. Hearing the sound of wind behind him, he quickly pressed the button and swung his hand back, and like a blind cat catching a dead mouse, he electrocuted a vicious dog that was about to pounce and bite, making its hair stand on end. It foamed at the mouth and fell on its back with its four legs in the air. The shock probably also stunned the ones behind it, as the pack of dogs just barked wildly and didn't advance. Before the three could think of their next move, the courtyard gate opened, and seven or eight household servants in green clothes rushed in, fully armed with swords, spears, and clubs. There was even a musketeer with a lit matchcord wrapped around his arm, the dark muzzle of his gun aimed straight at these three interdimensional travelers who were dreaming of getting rich.

The first group of people from another time they encountered on their journey through time and space were clearly not very friendly. Not only were they not friendly, but their lives were also in immediate danger. Having the dark muzzle of a musket pointed at them was a first-time experience for these nerds.

In their usual discussions of ancient firearms, they were very contemptuous of the Ming Dynasty's muskets, considering them to be crudely made and lacking in range and power. However, at this moment, with only a distance of twenty-odd paces between them, and the dark muzzle pointed at them, they figured that even the worst musket could blow their faces to smithereens. They were so panicked they didn't know what to do. The opening speech that [Wen Desi][y002] had prepared was swallowed back down in fear.

Fortunately, the servants hesitated after seeing the fate of the dogs. The two sides faced off for a moment. [Wen Desi][y002] thought that although it would not be difficult to escape by throwing a smoke bomb at this time, wouldn't his career as an interdimensional trader be over? How could he then talk about the great cause of unifying the world and rebuilding China in the future! At this thought, a heroic spirit rose from his gall bladder. He raised his hands high, speaking and gesturing in Cantonese, and threw over another powder box with a mirror to show that he had no ill intentions.

Unexpectedly, the powder box had such a great effect. Before long, the three of them went from being held at sword and gunpoint to being honored guests.

"Old Wang, do you think this is a trap? Did they lure us here to capture us?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] secretly glanced around. This was a real Ming Dynasty building, and what they were sitting on was real Ming Dynasty furniture. Any piece of it could be sold for a good price in their own time, but at this moment, no one was in the mood to appreciate it.

"If they wanted to make a move, they could have done it in the backyard..."

"Let's just be careful. By the way, don't drink the tea," [Wen Desi][y002] said in a low voice. "Looking at the servants of this family, the master is probably also a smuggler. This kind of person is mostly black-hearted and ruthless. Be careful he doesn't get any evil ideas."

"Yes, understood."

"[Zishan][y001], in a moment, if I throw a smoke bomb, you quickly help me get the wormhole out. We'll get out of here immediately."

"Understood."

As they were whispering, they saw a middle-aged man in fine clothes enter, surrounded by seven or eight servants. [Xiao Zishan][y001] and the others had just been in a flurry of activity and had just calmed down a bit. Now, their curiosity was greatly piquedâ€”this was a real, genuine person from the Great Ming! Three pairs of eyes stared intently at this well-maintained, fair-skinned middle-aged man.

Master Gao had just opened the box and was greatly surprised. He had been dealing in foreign goods for more than twenty years and was very knowledgeable. Not to mention that the powder box, being neither porcelain nor jade, was very rare, the mirror embedded inside was a priceless crystal mirror. He had only seen a few in all these years, and although they were much larger than this one, they were not as bright and clear. He had heard from the Frankish sea merchants that these crystal mirrors were only produced in one city in the West. The workshops were built on an island, heavily guarded, and the craft was always a secret. They were rare even in the Frankish country, let alone in this city of Guangzhou.

These three Japanese, what a grand gesture! Master Gao pondered in his heart. Could they be envoys from some famous lord in Japan? On second thought, the Japanese themselves had barely enough for their daily use, and nine out of ten of their goods had to be transported by Tang ships. How could they have such a rare treasure?

Since the other party was willing to show such goodwill with such an expensive gift, he had to meet them no matter what. Master Gao could already smell the silver. To be cautious, he still brought his most skilled household guards with him.

When they met face to face, Master Gao was stunned again. This group of people were not Japanese!

Guangzhou was a place where people from all five directions gathered, and he had seen many Japanese. Although these three men had short hair, it was not the common shaved head of the Japanese. One of them had his hair cut very short, like a monk, while the other two had slightly longer hair. Their clothes were rather strange, a jacket that opened in the front, short and not reaching the knees... This attire was not worn by the Japanese, nor by the Franks.

Moreover, these three men were tall, not short like the Japanese. Each was over five feet five inches tall, and one of them was even six feet tall.

Looking at their appearance: their skin was fair, and their hands and feet were not rough. It was clear that they were people who lived in comfort. Looking at their expressions, although they were somewhat apprehensive, there was no sense of humility or lowliness. There was a certain confidence in their every move.

Master Gao had been in the business world for many years and had a sharp eye, but looking at these three men, he couldn't figure them out.

As he was wondering, he saw the three men staring at him with extremely strange eyes. A chill ran down his spine, and he couldn't help but take a step back, thinking to himself, could these men have the passion of Longyang? Why would they look at a man like him with such a creepy gaze?

On this side, [Xiao Zishan][y001] and the others saw the middle-aged man's expression change uncertainly, and they also had some doubts. This man looked to be in his fifties, wearing a square flat-topped scarf and a silk round-collared robe. His features were regular, and he had a light beard. His fair face was slightly plump. He was a stark contrast to the dark, thin servants around him.

Master Gao cupped his hands towards [Wen Desi][y002] and asked, "May I ask what to call you, brave sirs?"

[Wen Desi][y002]'s windbreaker, because its hem was longer and its texture looked like silk, was clearly different from the coarse cloth clothes of the other two short-jacketed men, so Master Gao took him to be the leader.

As soon as these words were spoken, [Wen Desi][y002] immediately recognized that this was not Cantonese, but had a bit of a modern Nanjing accent. So he spoke in Mandarin: "We have come from overseas, and lost our way at night, accidentally entering your esteemed residence. May I ask what place this is?"

Although Master Gao didn't understand very well, he had a gut feeling that these people meant him no harm. After all, he was experienced in the ways of the world. He slowly asked, "Where have you brave sirs come from?"

Since they could communicate verbally, the two sides exchanged names through a combination of speaking and writing. [Wen Desi][y002] then recited the story they had already agreed upon.

"Our ancestors were all people of China. After the Battle of Yamen, they fled overseas. They once established a family business in Borneo, but alas, the ruler of that country saw that the Han people were becoming powerful and repeatedly would not tolerate us. We had no choice but to go to sea again, heading south, until we reached Australia, tens of thousands of li overseas. It has been more than two hundred years now."

Master Gao pondered for a moment and said, "So you are not Japanese?"

"We are people of China, how could we be Japanese?!" [Wang Luobin][y003] interjected with dissatisfaction.

Master Gao raised his eyelids slightly. This group of people from overseas really didn't know the rules. A mere subordinate was interrupting at will.

"We are not Japanese," [Wen Desi][y002] said. Seeing that this Ming Dynasty country gentleman had no objection to this story, he became bolder and said that Australia was originally a barren land with only a few natives. Their ancestors had blazed a trail there and finally created a paradise where they lived and worked in peace. For generations, their ancestors had cherished the memory of their homeland, so they sent a few of them with goods to come and see.

In fact, there were many loopholes in this story. How they entered the city, and where their ship was docked, were not explained. But just as [Wen Desi][y002] had predicted: sometimes you just need to have a story and stick to it.

Master Gao nodded frequently. He knew of the place Borneo. Every year, several foreign ships (in the Ming Dynasty, "foreign ships" did not mean foreign ships, but ships that sailed to foreign lands, i.e., Ming merchant trading ships) went there. He had never heard of this matter, but he was too lazy to be serious about it. Anyway, it was a matter of several hundred years ago, who could figure it out! Besides, he was not interested in Borneo or Australia.

"...We did not know the way and accidentally entered your esteemed residence, disturbing your honorable place. Please forgive us, please forgive us." As [Wen Desi][y002] spoke, he clumsily performed a cupped-hand salute. "We have come from overseas. May I ask what place this is?"

"It's nothing, it's nothing," Master Gao said. These people were carrying great treasures and could enter the city late at night; they were by no means simple. He would just take their story with a grain of salt. "This is Guangzhou Prefecture, Nanhai County, of the Great Ming."

[Wen Desi][y002] immediately followed up with another question: "May I ask what year, what month, and what day it is today?"

Master Gao was taken aback for a moment, then replied, "The second month of the seventh year of Tianqi."
