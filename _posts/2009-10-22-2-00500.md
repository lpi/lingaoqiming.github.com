"U.C. 0079, U.C. 0083, U.C. 0093, and A.C. 0197, assemble at Green Beach. Prepare to unload vehicles."

The call crackled over the walkie-talkie, and a group of men, their legs still wobbly from a day at sea, stirred from their rest on the sandy beach. The landing points were color-coded: Red Beach for the main pier, Yellow for small boats, and Green for the barge and landing craft. The U.C. groups were for licensed drivers of large vehicles, the A.C. for operators of construction machinery.

Qian Shuixie, a man who had dreamed of defending the new regime with a rifle in his hands, found himself assigned to U.C. 0079, a driver of large container trucks. He soon found a kindred spirit in Bai Yu, a graduate of an armored command school, now tasked with driving a tracked tractor.

To expedite the construction, all essential vehicles and materials had been loaded onto the 1,500-ton self-propelled barge. Its shallow draft allowed it to get closer to the shore, but a second floating pier had still been necessary to bridge the final gap.

The barge had no ramp of its own. The engineers had installed one on the floating pier, a precarious-looking structure that swayed with the gentle motion of the waves.

"Prepare to unload," Bai Yu, the temporary head of the vehicle groups, announced. "Pay attention to safety. If you think you're going into the water, get out of the vehicle. It's just like driving onto a ferry..."

The men exchanged nervous glances. A ferry was a stable, solid platform. This was a swaying, handmade contraption of steel and empty barrels.

Bai Yu knew he had to lead by example. He had driven tanks in the army. He steeled himself, climbed into the cab of the Dongfanghong 1202 tractor, and shouted, "Spot for me!"

The roar of the engine was a comforting sound, but the sight of the shifting ramp and the undulating pier was not. He fixed his eyes on Qian Shuixie, who was guiding him with a pair of small flags. The tractor's tracks grated against the steel plate of the ramp. The pier began to drift.

"Pull the cables!" Zhuo Tianmin, one of the engineers, yelled from the pier. Four steel cables had been attached to the barge for just this purpose. The men on the shore scrambled to pull, their muscles straining against the weight of the ship. With a final, lurching motion, the tractor was on the pier.

The first vehicle was ashore. The rest followed, and within two hours, the transmigrators' entire fleet of construction machinery was parked on the beach: tractors, backhoes, dump trucks, a road roller, a mobile crane, and two concrete mixers. It was an arsenal of creation, enough to build a new city.

But Mei Wan and Bing Feng, the men in charge of the construction, were still frustrated. They had machinery, fuel, and power, but they lacked the most basic of building materials: sand and crushed stone. Without them, concrete was an impossibility.

Bing Feng's first task was to build a cargo yard on Red Beach. It was a simple matter of clearing, grading, and compacting the earth. With a full suite of mechanized equipment, the work should have been easy. The transport group was repurposed as a construction crew, and the beach was soon filled with the roar of engines and a cloud of dust.

The work was a fiery, chaotic scene, a spectacle that attracted the attention of Ding Ding and his ever-present partner, Panpan. The foreign girl, dressed in a tight-fitting vest and denim hot pants, climbed over the construction site, her camera flashing. Her bare, white legs were a constant, flashing distraction, her provocative poses causing a surge of testosterone that nearly resulted in a series of accidents. Bing Feng, with a reluctant sigh, had to ask them to leave.

The yard was built on a gentle slope. The topsoil was removed, and the sandy soil beneath was used as fill, compacted in layers by the heavy road roller. The result was a solid, well-drained platform, ready to receive the tons of cargo that were now being unloaded from the ships.

"If only we had steel beams," Bing Feng said with a touch of regret. "We could build a proper warehouse. For now, tarps will have to do."

"And wood," Mei Wan added. "The watchtowers, the latrines... they all need wood."

Wood. The one resource they had assumed would be abundant. Hainan, the tropical island, a paradise of swaying coconut trees and dense forests. But the reality was different. Lingao was a land of savanna, its forests long since cleared for agriculture. The wood they needed would have to be found, or bartered for, or taken. The challenges of their new world were already beginning to mount.
