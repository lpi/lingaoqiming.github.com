"They won't take our lives, will they?"

"Oh, my mother must be worried sick," Ma Peng whimpered, wiping his tears.

Fu Buer's heart ached. *You have a mother, but I have a whole family!* His wife was one thing, but he couldn't bear the thought of losing his concubines, especially the third one, a woman from Guangzhou. She was a bit older, but she had been a courtesan in a high-class brothel, a *xingyuan*, and she was fashionable, and could sing, and was far more refined than the local country girls. She had completely captivated him.

And his son was young, his daughter unable to manage the family estate. If he didn't return, his uncles and cousins would surely embezzle his property. He had long been the object of their envy. The more he thought, the more he regretted his decision to join the fight. The guards were not particularly vigilant, just two young pirates. He fumbled in his robes and found two taels of silver. Fearing it wasn't enough, he added his gilded silver net scarf ring, worth another two or three *qian*. Two taels of silver, he thought, should be enough to buy his freedom. The appetite of these small-time pirates couldn't be too large.

He mustered his courage and approached one of the young pirates, offering the silver. He tried to explain in his broken Guangzhou dialect, pointing to himself, then to the outside, and making a running motion.

The young man was expressionless. He gestured with his bayoneted matchlock, and Fu Buer fell silent. He didn't dare to withdraw the silver; it would be confiscated in a search anyway. He might as well use it to buy some goodwill. But the young man refused the bribe, pointing instead to Fu Buer's injured leg and then to a large tent. He was to wait for treatment.

It was evening before the medical team had finished with all the wounded. Fu Buer's leg had been stitched up with more than ten stitches. The doctor told him he was lucky; the bullet had passed clean through the muscle without hitting bone or major blood vessels. For Fu Buer, it was a novel experience. He had never known that flesh could be sewn like cloth. He had screamed his head off during the procedure.

Two-thirds of the thirty or so seriously wounded had died while they waited. The doctors had little hope for the rest. They had no plasma, a shortage of qualified nurses, and it was unlikely the men would survive surgery.

"Let the military team give them a quick end," He Ma said. In their current situation, with resources so precious, it was unlikely they would be wasted on these men.

Shi Niaoren pondered for a moment. "No," he said. "Let's treat a dead horse as a living one. They've held on this long; their vitality is strong. Let's give it a try."

"But we have no plasma. We'd have to find donors, test their blood..."

"Just use saline," Shi Niaoren decided. "No anesthesia, either. Whether they survive is up to fate."

The medical team was stunned. To operate on these seriously wounded, bleeding, and in some cases unconscious men, without anesthesia or plasma... it was tantamount to murder.

"Didn't I say?" Shi Niaoren said. "Treat a dead horse as a living one. It's better than watching them die. At least this way, my conscience will be a little clearer." He didn't add what he was also thinking: *It will be good practice for us.*

"Come on, let's get to it." The medical team, already exhausted from a long day's work, began to prepare. They were short-staffed, especially on nurses, so the doctors had to assist each other. Even the veterinarian, Dr. Yang, was called in. He had just finished treating the three captured horses.

"Old Yang, can you operate on people?"

"I can operate on horses," Yang Baogui joked. "Debridement, disinfection, suturing... it's all the same. I can also do amputations."

"Let's get to it."

At the post-war review meeting that evening, five main problems were identified:

1.  **Insufficient military training and poor fighting will.** Most of the transmigrators were unskilled with firearms, and their aim was poor. They panicked at the first sign of danger, and some even fled from behind their fortifications.
2.  **Extremely poor organization.** The military group could not effectively command the temporarily organized masses. "A motley crew," He Ming had called them.
3.  **Inadequate protection.** The steel helmets and stab-proof vests had proven effective, but the protection area was too small. The limbs and face were vulnerable.
4.  **Overly cautious strategy.** They had limited themselves to Bairen Tan and had failed to take the initiative, resulting in a passive, defensive posture.
5.  **Insufficient defense of Bairen City.** The fortifications needed to be strengthened.

But the focus of the meeting was on future strategy.

The moderates advocated for strengthening their current position, focusing on industrial and technological development to create a "beacon effect" that would attract the local population and lead to a "peaceful evolution."

The radicals ridiculed this as the "turtle school." They were three centuries ahead of the locals, yet they cowered behind their trenches and barbed wire. They argued that if they did not destroy the local Ming government, they would never be able to fully exploit the resources of Lingao, and they would face constant harassment.

"Lingao County launched a two-pronged attack today," one of the radicals argued. "Tomorrow, they might launch a sneak attack. And as we venture further from the base to collect resources, will we always have to rely on the military group for escort?"

They listed the benefits of occupying the county town: a large labor pool, access to tax and corvee registers, and the seizure of the county treasury.

The allure of these benefits was strong. The moderates countered with historical data, arguing that the county was not wealthy and that the treasury would be meager.

At this point, [Ma Qianzhu][y005], a representative of the radicals, unexpectedly proposed to shelve the issue and focus on the problems of training and organization.

The lack of training was a serious issue. They had been working nonstop since they arrived, with only one live-fire exercise. In the recent battle, which had lasted less than an hour, they had expended nearly three thousand rounds of ammunition, a significant portion of their total stock of one million rounds.

The problem of organization was directly related to the lack of training. [Xiao Zishan][y001] proposed that the "basic labor groups," which were formed and reformed daily, be replaced with fixed four-person groups. These groups would live, work, and train together, fostering a sense of camaraderie and trust. Each group would be issued an SKS rifle for regular practice.

With these groups as the basic unit, a certain amount of time would be set aside each week for military training. Bei Wei then proposed a new training plan: "Hunting."

"Each time, our military group will dispatch five men, and they will take two or three ordinary groups with them," he explained. "We will move beyond the Wenlan River, conducting reconnaissance in all directions, correcting our maps, and investigating resources."

They would capture lone travelers or small groups, and, if necessary, attack local armed personnel, using combat as a training tool. The authority of the transmigrators would be extended to every corner of the county, spreading their reputation and a necessary dose of terror.

The plan was bloody, but the moderates, faced with the reality of their twenty-one wounded, chose not to oppose it. To do so would have invited a renewed push to attack Lingao County, a vote they were not sure they could win. They agreed to the "hunting" plan as a compromise.
