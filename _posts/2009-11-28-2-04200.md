The group approached the earthen rampart with trepidation. They were surprised to see that although the gate was closed, there was no drawbridge over the moat. Instead, a section of the road had been left intact. This was actually because a drawbridge wouldn't have the load-bearing capacity for the heavy machinery that frequently moved in and out of the camp; it would have been more trouble than it was worth.

They stopped an arrow's flight away and sent someone to hail the gate. It seemed their arrival was expected, as someone answered immediately. Zhang Youfu, having dealt with various pirates, could speak some Mandarin, Cantonese, and Minnan. The pirate at the gate, however, spoke a strange, hybrid form of Mandarin. Fortunately, they could still communicate. Zhang Youfu stated their purpose, and after a brief commotion on the wall, the gate opened. A dozen or so men came out.

Zhang Youfu knew that pirate chieftains, whether on land or at sea, often liked to put on a show of force to intimidate negotiators and extort more money. He had seen it all before. But this group of pirates had no such pageantry. Only a dozen men emerged, all dressed in simple, short green garments, carrying muskets with bayonets. When he saw the leader in the center, he was genuinely surprised. The man wore the same dark green short shirt and trousers as his men, with a pair of dusty short boots and a leather belt. Outwardly, he was indistinguishable from his followers. His appearance, demeanor, speech, and bearing were all gentle and refined, without a trace of a brutish outlaw.

"To think the chieftain of the 'Kun' bandits is so unassuming!" Zhang Youfu exclaimed inwardly.

The man was very polite to them. He introduced himself as Xi Yazhou but did not invite them into the stockade. He ordered his men to bring out chairs and benches and had them placed on the riverbank in front of the gate for the visitors to sit. Others brought wooden bowls and buckets of water from the camp for the porters.

The items brought for Zhang Youfu and his companions made the local squires' eyes widen: they were all glass cups! Though they were on Hainan Island, they knew the value of glassware. Two or three taels of silver could only buy a colored glass bowl, let alone such a crystal-clear glass cup.

The contents of the cups, however, were less impressive: a small white paper bag floated in the water, slowly dyeing it a pale green. A sniff revealed a faint, but very low-quality, tea-like aroma.

"What a grand display!" Zhang Youfu was both pleased and worried. He was pleased that the 'Kun' bandits were treating them with such high-end items, which should indicate their sincerity. He was worried that with such a grand display, the price they would have to negotiate later would not be a small sum.

This Xi Yazhou could speak some Cantonese, and they exchanged a few pleasantries. Then, a roar was heard from inside the gate, and a small four-wheeled vehicle came bumping along, causing a stir among the people on the riverbank. The news that the 'Kun' bandits had vehicles that could move without horses or oxen had already spread throughout the city. Some said there was sorcery involved, driven by the power of ghosts and gods. Others claimed the bandits had mastered the secrets of creation. The theories were endless.

From spies and militiamen, Zhang Youfugui knew that those who rode in such covered vehicles were high-ranking chieftains among the 'Kun' bandits. He knew the person in the vehicle was important and quickly stood up, trembling.

The few people who got out of the vehicle, however, were dressed in the same attire as the previous leader, with nothing special about them. Then, a few more people walked over. One of them, though bald, was wearing local homespun clothes, presumably a local who had been captured and joined the bandits.

The Lingao dialect spoken by the interpreter, Xiong Buyou, sounded a bit strange to Zhang Youfu, but the meaning was clear. Xi Yazhou explained that they were not pirates, but Chinese merchants who had lived overseas and were engaged in industry and commerce. They had returned to their home country to start a business. ([Xiao Zishan][y001] chuckled to himself: "When did we become 'sea turtles'?") Since arriving in Lingao, they had never harassed the people or opposed the government. Then his tone became severe, accusing the local "vicious gentry" of organizing militias to attack them without cause, causing them losses. They were forced to act in self-defense and reserved the right to take further action.

Zhang Youfu was obsequious, praising their non-disturbance of the populace. He then presented the gift list: one hundred taels of fine silver, eight bolts of bright red satin, twenty bolts of assorted silk, twenty bolts of Songjiang cotton cloth, ten *dan* of assorted grains, two pigs, four suckling pigs, one dressed deer, and two hundred *jin* of wine. Xi Yazhou took the list, read it, and passed it to the others sitting behind him. Seeing that the items were all useful, he smiled.

"We have caused much disturbance to the area by building our fortress here. How can we accept such a generous gift? But to refuse would be to disrespect the kindness of you gentlemen. In that case, we have no choice but to accept it all. We are truly unworthy of this honor."

Seeing him accept the gifts, Zhang Youfu took the opportunity to bring up the gentry's requests: first, with the autumn harvest approaching, they hoped the bandits would not plunder the working farmers; second, to ransom the captured men; and third, to return the bodies of those killed in the last battle to their families for burial.

He then promised that if they agreed, the county's gentry were willing to "assist with provisions and funds," ensuring the bandits would not be at a loss. The specific amount could be negotiated.

Xi Yazhou just nodded politely without answering. The matter was of great importance. He looked inquiringly at [Wen Desi][y002] and the others behind him. They exchanged a look, and then all rose and went to the duty room under the watchtower to confer. They all agreed that this matter concerned future policy and that a few of them making the decision was not appropriate. However, since the other side had shown an intention to de-escalate, they should respond positively.

Therefore, when Xi Yazhou returned, he directly agreed that the villages could send people and carts to retrieve the bodies. They would send someone to point out the burial sites. As a sign of good faith, they would also release a few of the wounded and disabled captives. As for the other two points, he said they needed further discussion and asked Zhang Youfu to return the next day.

Zhang Youfu hadn't expected to settle everything in one go. Seeing the other side readily agree to the return of the bodies and even release a few captives, he felt they were giving him a great deal of face. The remaining issues were probably not difficult, just a matter of price. He wasn't worried about that; the gentry would bear the cost, and his own reward for a successful negotiation would be substantial. Moreover, he could establish a connection with this group of 'Kun' bandits. He had a faint feeling that this group of pirates was different from any of the other outlaws he had ever encountered.

Before he left, following [Wen Desi][y002]'s instructions, Xi Yazhou gave Zhang Youfu a freshwater pearl necklace, originally priced at twenty-five RMB, and gave each porter fifty *wen* as a reward. Everyone, from top to bottom, was satisfied with this strange group of people.

Magistrate Wu and the entire city's officials and gentry were anxiously awaiting Zhang Youfu's return. In the afternoon, they saw him and his men come back with the news that the 'Kun' bandits were willing to return the bodies and even release a few captives. Hearing Zhang Youfu's description of the leaders as steady and unpretentious men, completely lacking the air of bandits, surprised everyone.

In the past, even if a captive died, their family would have to pay a hefty ransom to retrieve the body for burial. This time, they had agreed so readily. The villages hurriedly gathered men, made simple coffins, and prepared to collect the bodies the next day. Because many had died from all the villages, Magistrate Wu also ordered the county's charity hall to help collect the bodies. If any were unclaimed, they were to be collected as well.

The next day, men from all the villages came with carts loaded with coffins, reed mats, and many bags of lime. The transmigrators had arranged for a guide to show them the burial site, and then quickly withdrew, leaving only observers with high-powered binoculars to watch from a distance. The sanitation team had checked the wind direction and determined that the smell would not blow over, but everyone still wore masks.

Xi Yazhou and a few others watched from the watchtower. Through the binoculars, they could see the villagers, their faces and hands wrapped in cloth, digging. From time to time, they would move a dirt-stained object to the side. With each body exhumed, women, children, and the elderly would rush forward to identify it. Some wailed and beat the ground, others fainted. After watching for a while, he couldn't bear it anymore. He had never thought much of killing in battle, but the gruesome aftermath was deeply unsettling.

"We should have just cremated them all in the first place. Why bury them? They look too horrible," Xi Yazhou said. He knew the bodies had been buried for over ten days. Besides their clothing, they were mostly decomposed and unrecognizable.

"Burning the bodies would have earned us their hatred," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, refusing to look through the binoculars. "That would be like 'destroying the bones and scattering the ashes.' Now, the families can at least retrieve the bodies and give them a proper burial, which will bring them some comfort. This is a way of winning hearts and minds."

After the battle, the sanitation team, for reasons of hygiene and disease prevention, had suggested either cremating the bodies on pyres in the field or dumping them into the sea at Bopu. Most people agreed. However, Yu E'shui objected. He argued that the ancients held the bodies of the dead in high regard. "Collecting the bones" had always been a sign of benevolence throughout history. If they destroyed the bodies, it would greatly damage the transmigrators' image—after all, this was to be their base of operations.

Therefore, in the end, the bodies were collected and buried far from the camp. They had thought that would be the end of it. They hadn't expected that the third of the three conditions proposed by the county's negotiators would be the retrieval of the bodies. The many doubts about why the grandiloquent and sensationalist Yu E'shui deserved a seat on the Executive Committee vanished after this.

It took a whole day for the villages to collect and transport all the bodies. Some of the dead were the "dregs" of their villages, sent to their deaths. Naturally, no one came to claim them. In the end, they were all collected by the county's charity hall, placed in coffins, and buried in a common grave.
