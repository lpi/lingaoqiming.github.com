Dong Shiye gazed at the barren shore, a strange mix of exhilaration and terror churning in his gut. The autumn sun was warm, the air clean and sharp. *I've finally done it,* he thought. *I've come to the past.* The question of *why* he had wanted to come was a fleeting, unwelcome intrusion.

The deck was a chaotic, noisy press of bodies. The floating pier was too small, and many had to descend to the waiting boats via rope nets. It was a scene straight out of a World War II documentary, a modern-day Normandy landing. He had watched those old newsreels with a detached sense of admiration. Now, standing on the swaying deck, looking down at the bobbing boats and the dark, churning water, he felt a wave of vertigo.

The first accident was not long in coming. A portly man, passing luggage down to a boat, slipped and fell, his head striking the ship's rail before he plunged into the sea. A chorus of shouts and cries erupted from the deck. "Xi Yazhou is in the water! Man overboard!"

Amidst the chaos, a voice crackled over the loudspeaker, "C0071, C0077, C0081... logging mission!"

C0081. That was his group. A dark, sturdy man with a sapper shovel strapped to his pack turned to him. "Liu Zheng," he said, extending a hand. They exchanged names, comrades now in this strange, new enterprise.

"Logging?" Dong Shiye had never held a felling axe in his life.

"Me neither," Liu Zheng said with a grim smile. "I signed up for wilderness exploration. Is this what they call wilderness exploration?"

"And we have no tools."

"They'll have tools," Liu Zheng said. "The problem is, logging is a skilled trade. And it's dangerous. Are there any professional loggers among us?"

The grim faces of the men around them were answer enough.

The unloading of the cargo was a slow, frustrating process. The crane operators, new to their task, fumbled with the controls, their movements slow and clumsy. Pallets of cargo swung precariously over the heads of the men on the deck, who scattered like frightened birds. After a series of near-misses, the first pallet was finally lowered onto the pier, to a chorus of cheers.

But the cheers soon died. In their haste, they had forgotten to unload the forklifts. The pier was now blocked by a mountain of cargo, each pallet weighing over a ton, impossible to move by hand.

[Ma Qianzhu][y005], his mind racing, devised a solution. The landing craft was brought alongside, the forklifts loaded onto it and ferried to the shore. From there, they were driven back to the floating pier, a roundabout but effective solution to the logistical bottleneck.

Dong Shiye, his legs still trembling, finally set foot on solid ground. At the registration point, he was issued a felling axe, a heavy, awkward tool he had no idea how to wield. He and the other members of the logging group stood in a bewildered cluster, a motley collection of urbanites armed with saws and axes.

A burly man with a large travel bag and an even larger axe strode toward them. "My name is Wu Kuangming," he roared. "I'm the leader of the Lumber Group. Follow me."

A reconnaissance team had already surveyed the area. The timber resources were scarce. The coastal forests were essential for windbreak and erosion control. The groves along the river were mostly small, unsuitable for lumber. They had settled on a stand of tall mangrove trees at the estuary.

The logging site was a semi-swampy flat, a tangled mess of roots and branches that reeked of rot and decay. Wu Kuangming, a man who seemed born to the task, distributed high-top rain boots and gave a quick, brutal lesson in the art of felling a tree. "Swing the axe at an angle," he demonstrated. "First from the top down, then from the bottom up. And when the tree is about to fall, you shout! And you listen for the shouts of others! Don't get your head smashed in."

The men from the construction group were already waiting, their impatience a palpable thing. "When will we get the wood?" Zhuo Tianmin, a man with the soft, gentle air of a suburban dad, asked.

"What's the rush?" someone from the logging group shot back. "This isn't Age of Empires. We don't just click a mouse and get +10 wood."

"It should be +12," another voice chimed in. "We just upgraded our rope technology."

"I have +100 wood technology," Wu Kuangming declared. He reached into his travel bag and produced a massive chainsaw, the kind from a horror movie. With a heroic pull of the starter cord, it roared to life, spewing a cloud of blue smoke. He grinned, a savage, triumphant look on his face, and swung the saw at the base of a large tree.
