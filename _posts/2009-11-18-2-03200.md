The counter-attack plan in the county town basically came from Liu Dalin and Huang Shoutong. This inadvertently formed the common situation in the Ming Dynasty where the civil officials controlled the military. Jinshi Liu was very learned and, influenced by the political situation of the late Ming Dynasty, had read some military books and had some understanding of overall strategy and planning. Tuanzong Huang, on the other hand, had been on the front line of close combat for many years, had experienced countless small-scale battles, and was quite familiar with commanding troops in battle. The officials and gentry were very relieved to see this situation.

From the spies, they learned that the sea pirates were stationed at Bopu and Bairen Tan. The spies saw women at Bairen Tan, which meant that the pirates' main camp was there. If the main camp was there, the central army should also be there.

Although there were many people gathered in the city now, the number of those who could fight was limited. Huang Shoutong was a local native and had been leading braves in battle for many years. He knew which family's braves could fight and which could only bully the common people. The real fighting force was the one hundred Huang Family Village local braves he brought with him, as well as the local braves and retainers of a few local powerful gentry families, totaling no more than two hundred people. He planned to use these people as combat troops to directly attack the pirates' central command, preferably to kill a few leaders in one fell swoop.

This strategy was questioned by some of the gentry: would the pirates retaliate crazily if their leaders were killed?

"In matters of war, one must not be lucky," Huang Shoutong stroked his beard. "Once the swords are drawn, you must fight to the end. Don't think that showing mercy will give you a way out in the future. At that time, others will see you as weak and easy to bully, and will become even more aggressive." He glanced at the crowd, his expression stern. "If we beat them until they are in pain and afraid, they will run away on their own."

It was decided to act in two routes. The left route, with the Huang Family Village local braves as the main force, brought two Tiger Squatting Cannons dismantled from the city wall, as well as many rockets and gunpowder pots, a total of three hundred people, led by Huang Shoutong himself to directly attack Bairen Tan. The right route was led by Fu Baiwen, with more than three hundred people, but most of them were temporarily conscripted common people acting as militia. They carried many flags, horns, gongs, and drums to create a feint attack on the Bopu camp as a diversion. In order to prevent the pirates from having spies outside the city, the two routes set off together, pretending to be heading for Bopu. Halfway, the left route army turned back to launch a surprise attack on Bairen Tan.

The two routes agreed to use fire as a signal. The right route army would attack Bopu first, and then the main force would launch an attack. If either route wanted to withdraw from the battle, they would use wolf smoke as a signal.

In addition to the yamen runners, there were two hundred people left to guard the city. The county's archers and militia had not been paid for a long time. Wu Mingjin was afraid that if he left them to defend the city, they would take the opportunity to riot and plunder in the city and the four townships in case of a defeat. He also did not fully trust the local braves from the various villages, so he used the method of mixing sand, and the militia, local braves, archers, and garrison soldiers were mixed and organized to defend the city. The militia who did not want to go to war could only bribe the registrar. Those who had no money and were forced to go to war were all full of resentment.

On the sixteenth day of the ninth month, all preparations were complete. The county set up pots in the streets to cook rice. Many people were eating dry rice for the first time this year. They all crowded in front of the pots, looking and smelling with drooling mouths.

"My goodness, I can finally eat a full meal."

"Originally, we could only eat dry rice during the busy farming season. In the past two years, we couldn't even eat it during the busy farming season."

"The weather is also strange. It actually frosts in Lingao!"

"I'm just afraid this is our last meal."

"Don't say such unlucky things, it's not auspicious."

County Magistrate Wu Ya brought a few hundred strings of cash, saying it was a reward for setting out. He also brought twenty sets of newly made cotton armor—although the materials for this kind of armor were easy to obtain, it was too hot to wear in the South China Sea, so it was rarely used. This was a rush job. Huang Shoutong knew that the county magistrate was relying on him as a great wall, and he was very moved. He thanked him repeatedly and was determined to fight hard.

He called his second son over. Huang Shoutong's second son, Huang Bingkun, was a student in the county school and a shengyuan. Seeing that his third brother had just died a few days ago, and his father was preparing for war, looking like he was determined to fight to the death, he was very uneasy in his heart.

"Bingkun, your father is going to suppress the bandits today," he stroked his knee. "The sea pirates are powerful, and I am not very confident about this trip..."

"Father—"

"Don't speak," Huang Shoutong said in a deep voice. "Your father is already in his fifties. Even if there is an accident, you and your elder brother don't have to be too sad. Although your elder brother is brave, he doesn't like to study and is not as smart as you. Therefore, I only instruct you: in the past ten years, the world has become more and more chaotic. Fortunately, we are in a remote and small county. However, once the world is in great chaos, it is inevitable that some petty people will take the opportunity to cause trouble. Your first task is to lead the disciples to take up arms to defend the homeland, and the second is to obey the will of heaven!" He stared at his son's eyes, "You must not read a few more books and become a foolishly loyal and filial person. Do you understand?!"

"Yes! I understand." Huang Bingkun understood and was confused at the same time, but he did not dare to ask more.

"In a moment, you will follow me out of the city and return to Huang Family Village on the way."

"I am willing to go and fight with my father!"

"Silly boy..." Huang Shoutong sighed. "You are a xiucai. The battlefield is dangerous. The Huang family cannot be without you!"

"And elder brother—"

"Your elder brother is a commoner," Old Master Huang put on his cotton armor with the help of his retainers. "Magistrate Wu will always be transferred. Will the new magistrate in the future remember our sweat and blood? With a xiucai, our words will carry more weight."

After hearing this, he finally understood his father's painstaking efforts, but he still felt a little unwilling in his heart.

After instructing his son, Huang Shoutong led the large group of men out of the city. On the way, he was moved by Magistrate Wu's trust this time, but at the same time, he could not get rid of a bad premonition in his heart: this group of sea pirates who rode on huge iron ships and drove machinery that could not be resisted by human power were not the bandits and robbers he had always dealt with. Their arrival might mean that many things would change completely. He looked up at the sky. There were only faint floating clouds in the sky, but it made him feel that the sun was dim and without light. Was this world of the Ming Dynasty really going to undergo a great change?

After splitting up on the road, he first led the team to a place two li away from Bairen Tan. On the one hand, he waited for the feint attack on Bopu to begin, and on the other hand, he listened to the reports of the spies. He had made up his mind that if Bairen Tan was unprepared at this moment, he would attack in advance even if Fu Baiwen had not started there.

After a while, the spies reported that the pirates at Bairen Tan had all shrunk back to their respective camps, and there was no one moving outside. Huang Shoutong nodded. This was not beyond his expectation. The other side's spies had probably already detected their movements.

After waiting for a while longer, he suddenly saw a signal of smoke and fire in the direction of Bopu. He knew that Fu Baiwen had already begun to attack. He rode his horse up a small hill.

"Fellow villagers, we are about to attack the enemy's position. I and all of you are local natives, and have lived here for generations. Here are our fields, houses, and the tombs and ancestral halls of our ancestors..." At this point, he felt tears welling up in his eyes. "Today is the day for us to protect our homeland and repay the court. Everyone, follow me!"

After speaking, he kicked the stirrups of his horse and, with his mounted retainers as the vanguard, galloped towards Bairen Tan. The local braves were divided into two groups and followed closely behind the dozen or so cavalry. The gunners, in groups of ten, pulled and pushed, desperately pushing the two Tiger Squatting Cannons to the front.

He Ming had already seen their assembly with binoculars from the watchtower in the administrative area. At this moment, seeing the dust and smoke obscuring the sky and the sound of drums coming in waves, he knew that the attack had begun. He hurriedly picked up the walkie-talkie to give a warning. Almost at the same time, a sharp alarm sounded through the sky over Bairen Tan. Everyone was startled—the attack had begun!

"Team Leader He... Team Leader..." The person who came was from the communications team. At this moment, he couldn't even speak clearly. "Bopu is in danger! The enemy is besieging Bopu!"

He Ming frowned. From the tracking reports of the observation post, he knew that the enemy was divided into two routes. Obviously, one of them must be a feint. But the number of people in the two routes was about the same, and they all carried many wheelbarrows. Now they had launched an attack almost at the same time...

"Tell Bopu to hold on!" Bopu was much better fortified than Bairen Tan. Now there were more than a hundred people guarding it, including ten members of the military group. He felt that it was not a big problem to hold on.

On the contrary, this central place, because the construction was spread out, had many places to defend. The residential area had to be defended, the place where equipment and vehicles were stored had to be defended, the hydropower station had to be defended, and the newly built administrative area also had to be defended. Most places only had two barbed wire fences and one earthen rampart. The combat effectiveness of these urban otaku who had not fired many shots was still an unknown.

Huang Shoutong's men rushed to the edge of the trench and threw in the prepared earth bags and bundles of firewood, instantly paving a road. At this time, the gunshots rang out, and a dozen people around him immediately fell. The pirates' firearms were so sharp! He bent down, spurred his horse to run fast, the gunshots were continuous, and people around him kept falling. He turned his horse's head and decided not to attack the deep-seated pirate camp, but to concentrate his forces on attacking the nearest camp. He pointed with his broadsword:

"Brothers, charge!"

The camp he chose happened to be the administrative area. Because it had just been completed recently, even the barbed wire fence had just been set up yesterday. It was guarded by fifty people, ten of whom were members of the military group.

"Meng Xian! You are in charge of suppression!" He Ming roared in the walkie-talkie, "Shoot the ones on horseback."

Before he could finish his words, a local brave who was brandishing a sword and leaping on his horse fell to the ground with a gunshot.

"Damn, good shot!" he couldn't help but praise. This finance and accounting student who had practiced moving targets at the sports school for several years had really good marksmanship.

At this time, the local braves had already surged over like a tide. The gunshots were in a mess. The people behind the barbed wire fence saw these people baring their teeth and roaring, brandishing all kinds of weapons and charging over. Most of them were good citizens in the past. Let alone shooting and killing people, they had not even seen a group fight a few times. How could they have seen such a scene? They were all stunned and dumbfounded. After firing one shot, they were all dumbfounded, and only a few scattered shots were fired.

"Fire! You bunch of idiots!" He Ming suddenly picked up his SKS rifle, swung it hard to extend the bayonet, and rushed to the front, kicking and hitting them.

Finally, a volley of shots rang out. The gray tide of the charge stagnated for a moment, and then surged over again. At this time, scattered gunshots also came from other camps to support them. Most of the transmigrators were not familiar with shooting. Many people forgot to adjust the rear sight before firing, and some people kept pulling the trigger and firing randomly, and soon ran out of bullets.
