In the end, they decided to adopt the method of in-kind micro-loans, as it was easier to operate and more understandable for the peasants.

Young poultry would be provided to farmers on credit, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 per household. A contract for the exclusive purchase of the resulting poultry and eggs would be signed with the farmer, who would use the eggs to repay the principal and interest on the young birds.

"I propose that the principal and interest for each chick be a total of 20 eggs," Ye Yuming said.

"That's practically giving them away! It's too little," Wu Nanhai felt it was a bit of a loss. "The young poultry we give the farmers aren't newly hatched chicks, but 18-week-old pullets. The manpower and resources spent during this period are not insignificant. Moreover, the breeds of laying hens we've brought, whether the light White Leghorn or the medium-sized brown-egg layers, can produce an average of 220 to 280 eggs a year. A single hen can lay eggs for at least two to three years. I'd feel short-changed even if we asked for 50 eggs as the cost of the hen."

Ye Yuming said, "Since we're just starting the promotion, let's take a small loss. Let's stick with 20 eggs."

The so-called middle peasants, rich peasants, and small landlords of Lincheng all had limited financial capacity. The frugal and suspicious nature of the peasants meant that any such promotion, at its outset, had to present a sufficient lure of profit without making the terms seem too good to be trueâ€”the peasants wouldn't believe it.

Wan Lihui also agreed with Ye Yuming's viewpoint, saying that 50 eggs was indeed too many. The stated annual egg production was achieved under intensive farming conditions in a poultry farm, with an ample supply of compound feed. Under traditional farming methods, because the feed provided by the farmers is of a single type and generally insufficient in quantity, the poultry must spend more time foraging outdoors. In this situation, egg production would not be as high, and the probability of loss or death would also be much higher.

"I think it's very likely that a few of these 5 to 10 chickens will die for various reasons. Although you've studied agriculture, you don't know the hardships of the peasants," Wan Lihui said. "Raising livestock in the countryside, a single mistake can lead to a total loss. A few chickens might not seem like much to a modern person, but to the peasants here, it's probably a significant asset."

After much discussion, they finally accepted Ye Yuming's proposal: 20 eggs per hen would be collected as principal and interest for providing the laying hen. The repayment period would be six months from the day the farming began.

Once the principal and interest were paid off, the Heaven and Earth Society would buy all the eggs and, finally, buy back the hens that could no longer lay. Everyone felt that as long as the farmers fed them well and there were no accidental losses, the benefits from this plan were obvious.

"This is also a good opportunity for us to promote the use of circulation coupons to all the farmers in the county," Yan Ming said. The circulation coupons had been issued for over six months and had already established a certain degree of credit among the merchants in the county, but the farmers' recognition of this paper currency was still relatively low.

They would pay the farmers for their produce with paper currency. This would be coordinated with the policy in Dongmen Market to stimulate the use of circulation coupons: all purchases made with circulation coupons in stores opened by the transmigrator group would receive a 5% discount.

Precisely because the farmers instinctively distrusted the circulation coupons, they would spend them in the market as soon as they got them. This would further stimulate circulation and avoid the phenomenon of hoarding that occurred after paying with metal currency, truly getting the money to circulate.

"This isn't promotion; we're practically giving money away," someone lamented.

"Most countries in the world subsidize agriculture. Otherwise, no one would farm anymore," Ye Yuming said. "We can consider this a form of agricultural product subsidy policy."

"In the short term, we will take a small loss, but to do this kind of promotion, we must first win the trust of the people," Ye Yuming said in his concluding statement. "With trust as a foundation, it will be easier for the Heaven and Earth Society to promote anything in the future."

The poultry to be provided to the farmers was temporarily limited to laying hens. Wan Lihui suggested providing White Leghorns. This light, white-egg-laying breed was no longer very popular in the 21st century, but it was hardy, had a high feed conversion rate, and was good at foraging, making it very suitable for free-range farming by individual households.

"Another point is that we must provide feed and technical services for farming," Wu Nanhai said. "It's not enough to just give the chickens to the farmers; we have to follow up!"

The feed issue was particularly important. Free-range farming could greatly reduce the possibility of outbreaks like chicken plague, but the laying hens raised by the peasants of this era would obviously not be fed as sufficiently as those raised by 21st-century farmers.

The compound feed required by laying hens is particularly specific. According to modern animal husbandry, there are 39 different nutritional indicators for raising laying hens. Not only must they be provided with sufficient protein, but also enough fiber and calcium.

"Looking at the farmers here, they seem to be struggling to feed themselves. Are they capable of raising chickens? Don't let the chickens starve to death."

Raising chickens requires grain. In the past, although every household raised chickens to supplement their income, the scale was generally very small.

Wu Nanhai said, "Even if the farmers have enough grain to use, we still need to provide formulated feed, especially for protein and calcium. This has a great impact on the egg-laying rate. Otherwise, our promotion will be meaningless."

"How do we provide it?"

"An in-kind loan for feed, also to be repaid with eggs."

"With all these loans you're piling on, the farmers will be saddled with a chain of inescapable debt..."

"As long as our feed increases their production, they should be willing," Wu Nanhai seemed very confident about this. "In the past, farmers spent money to buy manure and household waste from the city, and bean cakes and peanut cakes from workshops... They have an investment mindset; they know that to have a good harvest, you need high input. We won't interfere with ordinary feed, but we will specialize in providing formulated feed to supplement protein and calcium, and add various nutrients that are easily deficient in free-range farming."

No one disagreed with this. The details would be worked out by the Agriculture Committee itself. The lending institution would be Delong. The Heaven and Earth Society and Delong would settle accounts internally. The Finance and Economics Committee hoped to quickly implement monetary settlement between departments to facilitate the improvement of the financial system, rather than relying on in-kind accounts that were difficult to value.

As a supporting project, Delong Grain Company would also launch a "Farmer Support Loan," a small cash loan specifically for farmers to buy agricultural materials like formulated feed, local veterinary medicines, and disinfectants. This would support farmers' production while expanding the circulation of grain coupons.

"I have an idea," Ye Yuming proposed another new idea before the meeting adjourned. "Iron farm tools in Lincheng are extremely scarce. Not only is the quality poor, but the price is also very high, which greatly affects production levels. The metallurgy department can't meet the demand for the entire county yet. Could we offer a special discount to the farmers who join the Heaven and Earth Society? For example, promoting new types of farm tools at a relatively cheaper price."

"I think that should be possible," Wu Nanhai nodded, turning to the Planning Committee representative, Dai Xie. This person had been in charge of material distribution on D-Day. As the organization gradually improved, he appeared less often, focusing on the administrative work of the Planning Committee. He was mainly responsible for the approval and review of various major projects and was a frequent sight at various construction sites.

"How many would you need, approximately?"

"The Agriculture Committee itself needs to expand its workforce and replace some worn-out tools, plus this promotion by the Heaven and Earth Society..." Wu Nanhai took out a notebook from his pocket. "...At least fifty pieces per month." As if afraid the Planning Committee would refuse outright, he added, "I'll turn in the damaged tools to the Planning Committee to be melted down and recycled."

Dai Xie said, "The problem isn't too big. The current daily steel output of the metallurgy department is enough to support this quantity. But if you give them to outside farmers, recovery will be difficult. This loss must be taken into account..."

"We can do a trade-in program. Have the farmers return their old tools, we'll give them a small subsidy for the difference, and then sell them new ones."

"In that case, it should be generally acceptable," Dai Xie agreed.

"Why don't we just open an agricultural supply store?" Wan Lihui had a sudden inspiration. He remembered that people who dealt in agricultural supplies in the countryside became very rich. "New farm tools, formulated feed, local pesticides, local fertilizers, seeds... with so many good things, we won't have to worry about customers."

Everyone thought this was a good idea. It was decided that the Heaven and Earth Society would open an agricultural supply store in Dongmen Market to sell various agricultural products under the "Heaven and Earth Society" brand. In the initial stage, these products would only be supplied to the landlords and small farmers participating in the promotion plan and would not be sold externally.

"Except for iron farm tools and seedlings, which cannot be widely promoted in the short term, formulated feed, local pesticides, and local fertilizers... should be available for open supply very soon," Wu Nanhai said.

After the meeting, Yan Ming enthusiastically discussed the prices of agricultural supplies with Ye Yuming, Dai Xie, and othersâ€”the "Farmer Support Loans" to be issued would mainly be used to purchase these products. While they were arguing about prices, Wu Nanhai rushed back to the farm with Wan Lihui.

Wan Lihui asked Wu Nanhai what the "formulated feed" would be made of. Wan Lihui knew that the farm's grain reserves were not actually that large. There wasn't much grain to make feed with; they would most likely have to rely on by-products from the seafood factory: fish bones and scales.

Wu Nanhai went into a special warehouse and came out with a wooden box. "This is the main ingredient of my formulated feed."

"What is this?!"

"Earthworms," Wu Nanhai smiled. "Have you ever raised them in the countryside?"

"Noâ€”" Wan Lihui had a sudden realization. "But I've heard of people doing it, mainly to supply professional chicken farmers!"

"Right. Besides earthworms, I also plan to raise maggotsâ€”I haven't done that myself, and I can't find enough culture medium. Let's start with the simple earthworms."

"So you're planning to use earthworms as the raw material for the formulated feed."

"We'll also need to add some plant-based ingredients, fish offal powder, and shell powder. These are all things laying hens need."

The main formula Wu Nanhai had devised for the feed was: dried earthworm powder, fish offal powder, and shell powder. He didn't have corn, the most common feed grain, so he could only provide a formulated supplement.
