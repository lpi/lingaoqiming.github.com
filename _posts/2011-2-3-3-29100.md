"Yes, I am..." He Xin had been called "130080" for several months, and he was already a little slow to respond to his own name. He hesitated for a moment before answering.

"Sir, you want him?" Fu Youdi smiled. "This kid is just a pretty boy. He's terrible at work."

Lin Baiguang ignored him and carefully looked at the former pirate leader before him.

He Xin saw this Australian staring at his body up and down without saying a word, and couldn't help but tremble—he still had a deep impression of the SM-GAY films he had seen during his past interrogations.

This former pirate, former dandy, was almost naked at this moment, with only a tattered piece of cloth around his waist like a loincloth. His body was covered in deep and shallow bruises from being beaten with a rattan whip. This Fu Youdi was really vicious. No wonder his name now made the local natives tremble with fear. Lin Baiguang looked at Fu Youdi's recently fattened belly and suspected that he had made a fortune from the prison here.

But that was none of his business. The problem of official corruption would be slowly investigated by Yi Fan.

"Wash him first and get him some clothes," Lin Baiguang ordered Fu Youdi.

After bringing the slightly more human-like He Xin back to the camp, Lin Baiguang ordered Gao Di to take him for a bath. The "purification" step was unnecessary; the labor reform camp had already done it.

After He Xin had washed and changed into clean clothes, he looked much more presentable when he returned to the room. In the past few months, he had gone from "heaven" to "hell," and now, someone had rescued him from "hell." It felt like a dream.

He didn't know why he had been able to climb out of that hell. He had never seen the Australian who had taken him away, nor was he one of the people he had seen when he came to Lin'gao to buy grain under the orders of the great chief.

Thinking of the great chief, He Xin couldn't help but feel a wave of despair—the news of Zhu Cailao's entire army being wiped out had long since spread in the labor reform camp. He hadn't quite believed it at first, but later, many scattered pirates who had been robbing in the Qiongzhou Strait were also captured and brought to the labor reform camp. Among them were some of Zhu Cailao's old subordinates, so the news was true.

His great backer, Zhu Cailao, was already dead. What did this Australian want him for? He Xin wondered secretly. Although he had been a "pirate" for ten years, he had never fought or killed. As for nautical skills like steering a ship and navigating by the stars, he hadn't learned them either. He only had a set of skills for eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling.

Could it be about the great chief's treasure? He Xin recalled that after he was captured, he had been interrogated for an unknown amount of time in a place where he couldn't tell day from night. He had been asked about every trivial matter in the great chief's gang.

Could it be that after the great chief's death, the Australians coveted his treasure? He really knew nothing about this. Thinking of the days and nights of torture in the small dark room, plus the threat of being "sold to a Westerner's brothel," He Xin's legs felt weak.

While he was lost in thought, the Australian who had pulled him out of "hell" came to see him. Gao Di also brought a plate of food.

The food was from the quarantine camp's main kitchen. Of course, it wasn't exquisite, but at least there were seafood such as fish, meat, and shellfish. Compared to the brown rice and salty vegetable soup with not a drop of oil in the labor camp, it was a delicacy.

The food in the labor camp was designed by the nutrition doctor Chen Sigen to ensure that the prisoners could get enough carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to sustain their hard labor. The taste was completely out of the question.

He Xin's eyes and mouth watered at the sight of the food, but he had been beaten so much by the rattan whip in the past few months that even with delicious food in front of him, he didn't dare to eat without permission.

"Eat something first," Lin Baiguang said. "Don't be afraid. You're my man from now on."

"Thank you for your great kindness, sir—" He Xin was so moved he almost burst into tears. He quickly prostrated himself on the ground and kowtowed.

"No need to kowtow," Lin Baiguang said. "Eat first, we'll talk after you've eaten."

He Xin quickly lowered his head and began to wolf down the food. In the past, in the pirate group, he wouldn't have even looked at this kind of food, but now it tasted exceptionally delicious. Thinking of the hardships he had endured in the past few months, he couldn't help but cry as he ate.

"What are you crying for? A grown man, crying over a little hardship."

"I... I dare not..." He Xin wiped his tears while swallowing large mouthfuls of food.

"Work hard for me in the future, and you won't be treated unfairly."

"Yes, yes, I will definitely..." He Xin's words were choked back by a large mouthful of rice.

"If you dare not to be definite, I'll send you back," Lin Baiguang smiled slightly.

"I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare," He Xin was so scared he stopped eating and prostrated himself again, kowtowing repeatedly.

"Get up and eat first," Lin Baiguang said. After he returned, he had specially followed Xiong Buyou for a few days, visiting the county yamen and the homes of the local gentry, learning the mannerisms of the powerful.

After He Xin finished his meal and Gao Di had cleared the table, Lin Baiguang asked, "I hear you're very good at playing?"

He Xin was stunned. What did these ambiguous words "very good at playing" mean? After a long while, he said, "I have been a bit wild in the past, fond of gambling and drinking..."

"What can you play? Tell me all about it," Lin Baiguang said, encouraging him to speak, fearing he might have reservations. "To be honest with you, I'm going to Qiongshan to do business, and I want to borrow your talent."

He Xin suddenly understood. It turned out this Australian wanted him to be a pimp. This was his specialty. His spirits immediately rose. He was not a very scheming person, and his face immediately relaxed. He boasted, "I dare not boast of knowing too many tricks, but I am proficient in kicking a ball, playing shuanglu, chess, dominoes, and singing. I can also play the pipa."

Lin Baiguang nodded. He really had "professional skills." He asked, "Do you frequent brothels and casinos?"

"I'm not afraid of you laughing at me, sir," He Xin said with a fawning smile. "Before I joined the great chief, I had no means of livelihood, so I helped out in brothels for food. In Guangdong, I've been to all three classes of brothels, high, medium, and low. I also have many familiar madams."

"Can you write?"

"Yes, I studied in a private school for a few years, and I can write letters..."

"Good. From now on, you will follow me and be my hanger-on," Lin Baiguang said. "I will be going out to do business in a few days, and you will come with me."

"Yes, sir. I will definitely serve you with all my heart," He Xin was overjoyed to hear that he could leave Lin'gao. The farther away from here, the farther away from the terrible demon Fu Youdi.

"From now on, you will call me 'Master'," Lin Baiguang instructed.

Gao Di pushed the door open again and brought in a porcelain bottle. This was the medicine he had just picked up from the Lin'gao General Hospital. It was a new trauma medicine developed by Runshitang. The formula was obtained by Liu San from the confiscated property of the head of the Zao Ban, Lin Changsan. The Zao Ban was in charge of punishments, and the head of the ban had an ancestral formula for treating injuries from beatings. After Liu San obtained it, he consulted with Yang Shixiang, added and subtracted a few medicinal ingredients, and made this external patent medicine. Liu San named it "Sanlitong."

Sanlitong received great praise during its trial use in Foshan. After autumn, the weather turned cool, and the Zhuge Xingjun San and the Plague Dispelling San had entered their off-season. This all-season medicine, which specialized in treating trauma, external labor, and internal injuries, was just right to fill the sales gap.

"Take off your clothes and let Brother Gao apply the medicine for you."

"Thank you, Master," He Xin was so moved that tears streamed down his face.

After the medicine was applied, Lin Baiguang comforted him a few more times and told him to rest well. He and Gao Di left the room.

"Go and tell Yanghe to have someone keep an eye on him."

"Understood," Gao Di nodded knowingly.

Lin Baiguang went to the Finance and Economics Committee again and received three hundred taels of silver as activity funds—Qiongshan did not yet have a branch of Delong, so bank drafts could not be used.

"Is this enough money?" Cheng Dong asked.

"It's enough," Lin Baiguang said. "It's enough to get through the first one or two months. Once the grain store opens, it will be able to earn its own activity funds."

"Alright. But although Wanfeng is a cover for the intelligence station, it is essentially a commercial enterprise directly under the Executive Committee..."

"I understand. I need to go through the procedures to use the money," Lin Baiguang said. "I can't just withdraw and use the money directly. Give me the procedures."

"This is the expense voucher," Cheng Dong handed him a small jewelry box with a small padlock. Inside were several stacks of printed vouchers, a box of carbon paper, pencils, a special account book, and several wooden official seals.

Cheng Dong explained the entire process of withdrawing and reimbursing funds, and reminded him: all the vouchers are in serial number, and even the voided ones must be kept without a single one missing.

"Of course, you are now the sole signatory for the Wanfeng Grain Store, and you can approve and withdraw funds yourself. But the financial procedures must be complete. The Audit Committee will send people to conduct random checks on the accounts of the Qiongzhou intelligence station and the Wanfeng Rice Store from time to time."

"It's best to have a strict financial system. I support it with both hands," Lin Baiguang said. "This will also clear up any doubts, so people won't think that those on business trips outside are all engaged in corruption."

Lin Baiguang also made the most of his time to visit several other departments and receive various equipment and materials he needed. He filled out forms, opened orders, and stamped and signed everywhere, which made him feel as if he had returned to his days as a civil servant.

It seems that the essence of so-called institutionalization is bureaucratization, Lin Baiguang thought, looking at the ever-expanding Executive Committee, his legs sore from running up and down the stairs.

A few days later, Lin Baiguang, disguised as a rich merchant of the Great Ming, set off from Bopu by boat with a group of people.

When Lin Baiguang left, he felt a sense of relief. Many transmigrators had developed a special affection for Lin'gao and Bairen City, regarding it as their second hometown and a small haven of peace. They were always a little unhappy when they had to leave on official business. But Lin Baiguang did not have this feeling. Instead, he felt a sense of freedom, like a bird flying high in the sky. He had a vague premonition that he would start from Qiongzhou and embark on a long road—he would not return to Lin'gao.
