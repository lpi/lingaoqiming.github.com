"From the moment you pulled out that chainsaw, I knew there was no future for China's environment!" Thirty years from now, at the Third National Environmental Protection Work Conference, Dai Xie's impassioned speech would mark the beginning of the end for Wu Kuangming's career as Minister of Forestry. But on this day, he was a hero, a one-man logging crew, his productivity a testament to the power of modern technology and the utter incompetence of his fellow transmigrators.

The logging groups, a collection of urbanites armed with saws and axes, were a study in futility. They swung their axes with more enthusiasm than skill, their saws constantly getting stuck. They broke more tools than they felled trees, much to the chagrin of the men from the Planning Commission.

Wu Kuangming, his chainsaw a roaring extension of his will, moved among them, a whirlwind of sawdust and sweat. He was no expert, but he was a man of action. He gave impromptu lessons in the art of felling a tree, his voice a constant stream of encouragement and profanity.

"Be careful," he warned a pair of men struggling with a two-man saw. "Don't break the blade. The Planning Commission is already giving me the evil eye."

"I've lost all hope," one of them, Hu Yicheng, sighed. "I'm a high-tech talent, and they have me pulling a saw. My old classmates would die laughing."

"Experts use skill," Wu Kuangming replied. "Amateurs use brute force. You'll learn."

"No way am I touching that chainsaw," the other man, Shao Zong, said. "I'd probably chop off my own leg. I thought I was going to be building China Telecom, not cutting down telephone poles."

Suddenly, a scream pierced the air. "Snake!" Three or four men scrambled out of the woods, their faces pale with terror.

Wu Kuangming rolled his eyes. It was a common enough occurrence for a logger. The mangrove swamp was a haven for reptiles. That was why he had insisted on high-top rain boots.

Liu Zheng, however, was intrigued. He fashioned a forked stick from a branch. "I'll go take a look," he said. "Maybe we'll have an extra dish for dinner."

"The Committee said no eating wild animals," Wu Kuangming reminded him.

"To hell with the Committee," Liu Zheng replied. He was an experienced outdoorsman, and a snake was a welcome addition to the monotonous diet of military rations. He disappeared into the woods, but returned empty-handed.

As Wu Kuangming was calming the shaken men, another scream, this one of pain, echoed through the forest. A young man had been struck by a falling tree. A quick examination revealed a nasty gash, but no serious injury. He was loaded onto a farm truck and sent back to the ship's infirmary.

The incident rattled Wu Kuangming. He was no expert, and he was leading a team of amateurs in a dangerous task. This was the first accident since the landing, a blemish on their new beginning. He spent the rest of the day patrolling the logging site, his chainsaw now used more for demonstration than for felling.

The felled timber was dragged to the beach, the branches and leaves piled to the side. The wood was green and wet, unsuitable for permanent construction, but it would have to do for the temporary structures they needed to build.

Dai Xie, the man who would one day be Wu Kuangming's nemesis, was at this moment a simple clerk in the Planning Commission, his task to track the flow of materials. He watched with a growing sense of despair as Wu Kuangming, his chainsaw a roaring symbol of industrial might, laid waste to the ancient mangrove forest. *It's over,* he thought, a wave of environmentalist angst washing over him. *With such a weapon in hand, there is no future for China's environment.*

His reverie was shattered by Wu Kuangming's unique shriek: "Timber!" He dove to the side, narrowly avoiding a crashing tree. "Your sister!" he roared, covered in mud. "Did you do that on purpose?"

"I don't have a sister," Wu Kuangming replied with a look of pure innocence. The first grudge between the two men had been forged.

With a steady supply of timber, the construction group, led by the gentle-faced Zhuo Tianmin, began their first project: the latrine. It was a task of paramount importance, a cornerstone of their new, sanitary civilization.

Tian Jiujiu, the drainage expert, was in charge. His initial plan, a simple platform over the water, had been vetoed by the environmentalists and the agriculture group, the latter of whom, led by the fanatical [Wu Nanhai][y009], saw the human waste as a precious source of fertilizer.

The revised plan called for a pit-style latrine, a more complex undertaking that required a significant amount of earthwork. A team of "basic laborers" and an excavator were assigned to the task. The pit was dug, the edges shored up with tree trunks. The squatting platforms were fashioned from branches lashed together with vines. The walls were a wattle-and-daub construction of sticks, vines, and mud-caked leaves. It was a crude, primitive structure, but it was a start. It was a symbol of their determination to build a new world, one latrine at a time.
