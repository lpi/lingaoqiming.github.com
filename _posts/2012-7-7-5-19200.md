The Grain Collection Bureau set up branches in the county seat and major market towns to make it convenient for the people to pay their taxes. The unit of collection was the circulation coupon. Taxpayers could also use grain, gold, silver, copper coins, and other goods in kind, which would be converted to coupon value at the official grain price. The General Directorate of Finance had originally intended to completely ban the circulation of silver and copper coins in the outer counties, but at this stage, the status of circulation coupons was not yet stable enough, so for the time being, they had to adopt a multi-payment approach.

To attract the large households to pay more in grain and to support the circulation coupons, Cheng Dong had instructed the Delong Grain Company to raise the grain purchase price slightly. This way, the same amount of grain could be exchanged for more coupons, giving a small advantage to those paying with grain.

Under Liu Xiang's "care," the tax collection work in Qiongshan rapidly unfolded. Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, and Chengmai were the "key counties" for the summer tax collection. Not only were they given priority in terms of professional personnel, but they also received as much military backing as possible. Each county was guaranteed at least three infantry companies, plus a local county garrison company. The officers were instructed to fully obey the commands of the Elders in each county and to do their utmost to assist in the collection.

Qiongshan County was the focal point of the summer tax collection, and Liu Xiang was eager to fully demonstrate his "governing ability" through this process, so he was particularly hands-on with the collection work. All non-essential work in the county office was suspended, and the staff were dispatched to assist with the collection. Laborers were recruited to repair warehouses and level roads. Two hand-cranked straw weaving machines were transported from Lingao to make straw bags for grain. The Delong Bank's Qiongshan branch also added more platform scales and staff at its entrance to ensure that all grain-paying households could sell their grain and complete their tax payments as quickly as possible.

The weather grew hotter by the day, but the propaganda team members were full of enthusiasm. They paraded through the streets and alleys every day, performing, posting slogans, and doing lion dances to publicize the new tax law. The area around the county seat was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, creating a bustling and noisy scene.

This atmosphere artificially created a sense of tension and excitement, urging everyone to hurry and pay their taxes.

No matter how unwilling the large households were in their hearts, they all realized that this Australian summer tax was unavoidable. When Hai Shuzu returned and told everyone that "Chief Liu" was also prepared to settle accounts with them for decades of back taxes, everyone felt it was better to obediently pay the Australian summer tax and not bring up the Ming dynasty's past. If they were to truly settle that muddled old account, they would go bankrupt and still not be able to pay it off.

A portion of the people were very dissatisfied with the merging of the poll tax into the land tax and the cancellation of the gentry and scholars' exemption from the poll tax. Coupled with the land survey campaign in the previous stage, the interests of the few scholar-gentry with official honors were severely damaged. They all realized that their days of lording over the local populace under the Kun thieves' rule were gone forever, and so they harbored deep resentment. For now, the streets were full of gleaming bayonets, and Qiongshan was too remote to form a powerful group. These people could only swallow their hatred and lie low, putting on an appearance of being law-abiding citizens. In addition to paying taxes according to the regulations, some even proactively sent their children to study in Lingao to show their "sincerity."

Some also secretly networked, grumbling to each other. Others, who actually owned very little land but held the title of a *xiucai* and frequented the homes of the gentry, were exempt from taxes under the new regulations. However, they were resentful that their "exemption" privilege had been cancelled. After all, the primary benefits of a *xiucai* title were exemption from grain tax and corvée labor. Besides the economic benefits, it was also a privilege. Now that the privilege was gone, they felt diminished. So they joined the gentry in their complaints. A few even went to the Wanshou Palace on the first and fifteenth of the month to pay homage to the ancestors of the Great Ming, to show that they had not forgotten the dynasty. Children's rhymes like "the short-hairs won't last long, the iron ships will eventually sink" also began to spread on the streets.

Lu Cheng reported this information to the Security Bureau and also to Liu Xiang. He was not concerned about it. His focus was on grain. Besides, the government structure was slowly being established, local security was not an issue, and with the army and the garrison company as backup, what kind of trouble could this group stir up?

"It's fine, just keep a close eye on them. Once I've squeezed them dry, let's see what tricks they can still pull," Liu Xiang said with full confidence. "Besides, we still have the county garrison company. With bayonets out, let's see who dares to speak or act recklessly."

"The county garrison company, apart from the officers and sergeants, consists mostly of former military households. They may not be reliable," Lu Cheng said, adhering to the "suspect everything" mindset of the General Political Security Bureau.

"We'll see. The ideological education of the army is Wei Aiwen's business; I can't interfere," Liu Xiang said. Although he had a slight fondness for Lu Cheng, he disliked her work style. He had too much on his plate to be "grasping class struggle" all day long.

"Just keep an eye on them for now," he said. "Have you started the surveillance on the tax officials that I assigned you?"

"We've already begun," Lu Cheng reported. She hesitated for a moment. "Chief, we're short on manpower. We have to monitor the gentry and the tax officials at the same time. We're a bit overwhelmed..."

The Qiongshan County political security reconnaissance network was the largest outside of Lingao. They had taken over more than twenty "informants" from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, but facing seventy to eighty official and temporary tax collectors, this was not enough.

"Just assign fewer people to the gentry. The main focus should be on this tax collection work. There are too many new people; if we don't watch them closely, problems can easily arise."

"But, shouldn't this matter be handled by the CHEKA..."

"The CHEKA is responsible for auditing accounts. It doesn't conflict with your work," Liu Xiang waved his hand. "It's settled."

The summer tax collection in Qiongshan County went very smoothly. Under the progressive system, households with less land, despite suffering from the typhoon, had a relatively small burden and would not face severe hardship. Households with more land, although their burden was heavy, had more savings from the past. For those with truly special circumstances who had difficulty paying taxes, their situation was investigated and they were given certain reductions or exemptions. Liu Xiang now had a personal understanding of the saying, "taxation is an important lever for regulating the economy."

Under Liu Xiang's full-scale collection efforts, just halfway through the collection period, Qiongshan County had already collected the equivalent of 18,000 taels of treasury silver. It was estimated that the final total could reach around 30,000 taels. This income brought "great delight to the dragon's countenance." When Liu Xiang came to report, Wu De repeatedly clapped him on the shoulder with such force that Liu Xiang's shoulder almost swelled up.

"It's nothing, it's all what I should do. All in service of the Senate," Liu Xiang said, enduring the pain in his shoulder. He thought, this old fisherman, this old navy man, has such a strong grip. He tried hard to keep a smile on his face and maintain a humble expression.

"You're being modest. Among the four key counties in northern Qiongbei, Qiongshan is the first to complete its quota ahead of schedule—and you've exceeded it," Wu De said, motioning for him to sit in a rattan armchair. "At the last meeting, I told Old Ma: whether the leadership team is strong or not is very important!"

Liu Xiang gave a dry laugh. It sounded as if the Executive Committee was somewhat dissatisfied with the directors of the other counties. But this was a sensitive topic, so he didn't want to discuss it further and simply offered no opinion.

Wu De probably understood his thoughts and smiled. "We are in a very difficult situation right now—I'm sure you know."

"Yes, I know from reading the newspapers and documents that the central government is not having an easy time. There are too many places that need money."

Wu De was taken aback by being called the "central government," as no one had ever referred to the Executive Committee that way before. He didn't correct him.

"Everywhere they're asking for money, grain, and people. We've spread ourselves too thin," he said with a wry smile, patting the pile of documents on his desk. "The construction and development on Hainan Island alone is a huge expense, and we also have to expand outside the island: Taiwan, Shandong, all bottomless pits!"

Hearing this, Liu Xiang asked, "What, has the Shandong operation already begun?"

"It's fine to tell you—you're an Elder," Wu De said. "Zhao Yingong has already made contact with Sun Yuanhua's side and is preparing to set up a farm there as a base. Although the scale is not large, it still requires infrastructure investment. He also plans to do some agriculture there, which also needs investment. And Taiwan, not to mention. And then there's Jeju Island." He shook his head at this point. "Our territory, to be frank, is just one Hainan Island, and more than half of it is undeveloped, with few people and little land. We want to squeeze oil from stones, but we're afraid the people will rebel."

Liu Xiang quickly said, "Squeezing oil from stones is impossible, and the people can't bear it. In Qiongshan, I'm still following the experience from Lingao, the so-called 'reasonable burden'—the rich bear more, the poor bear less. As long as things are done fairly, the people can accept it."

"And the gentry and scholars?"

"They certainly have their opinions, but they don't dare do anything. The previous campaign to suppress bandits and survey the land has scared them out of their wits."

"Hmm, you need to be careful. Although they don't dare to act openly, these people have a lot of power and great influence over the common people. We must prevent them from using underhanded methods," Wu De reminded him. "Qiongzhou is our base; it cannot be chaotic."

"I understand," Liu Xiang said, putting on a pious expression of "listening to instruction." Seeing that Wu De had no more to say, he quickly added:

"I have a few things I'd like to report."

Wu De smiled. "Go ahead. You're here to ask for things, aren't you?"

"Director Wu, you are truly prescient..." Liu Xiang's skin had thickened considerably. He had used the success of the tax collection as an opportunity to come to Lingao in person to report, precisely to get the resources he wanted. If he didn't apply at this juncture, who knew when he would get these things.

"Alright, we are all Elder comrades. Let's be direct. What do you want?"

Liu Xiang took out the proposal from his fake BOSS briefcase and explained his and Tang Menglong's ideas for several small-scale county-run industries.
