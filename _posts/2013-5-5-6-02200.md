Ying Yu raised his binoculars and looked towards Anping again. Unfortunately, there was no decent high ground here. The sand dune was only six or seven meters high, just slightly taller than Anping's city walls. From this vantage point, he could only barely see the streets within the town; he couldn't get a clear, overhead view of Zheng Zhilong's mansion.

Ying Yu shook his head. As the captain of the army's artillery training team, he had spent the last few years out of the limelight, dedicating all his energy to artillery gunnery and training. The smoothbore cannons widely used by the army and navy had nothing in common with the 130mm cannons he had used in his past life.

This primitive version of a howitzer seemed almost like a toy to him, yet it was the pinnacle of the Senate's industrial system. He had spent nearly six months familiarizing himself with the several new types of rifled cannons, both muzzle-loading and breech-loading, that the machine works had produced, from their successful trial production to their testing by the troops. He had basically mastered their ballistic properties and firing principles.

The reason he was chosen to lead this "decapitation" artillery strike on Anping was not only his familiarity with the cannons but also because he was one of the very few Transmigrators capable of conducting over-the-horizon fire. The local recruits were not even a consideration. After all, until now, almost all cannons used by the Fubo Army and Navy were fired within line of sight, even the howitzers.

With the range of the Experimental Type 32 Battalion Gun, the entire town of Anping was within its effective firing range. However, accurately hitting Zheng Zhilong's mansion without any observation was a very difficult task.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau had spent the better part of a year creating a map of Anping and Zheng Zhilong's mansion. This map had been incredibly difficult to produce. While it was easy to infiltrate Anping, and not too difficult to get inside the Zheng mansion, it was asking too much of the semi-literate agents, with only a few months of training, to accurately survey and create a map suitable for artillery fire direction using only pacing methods. Therefore, Ying Yu did not have much confidence in using this map for precision shelling.

Fortunately, they also had large model aircraft. A few months ago, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had organized a fly-over of Anping for aerial photography, capturing a complete overhead view of the town. By cross-referencing these photos with the on-the-ground surveys, they created a large-scale, high-precision map with a grid coordinate system.

The brief appearance of the model airplane had caused a commotion in Anping and the surrounding areas. For a time, rumors flew. Various temples in Jinjiang and Nan'an counties either openly or subtly claimed that this "divine sign" was related to their resident deity, and for a while, incense offerings at these temples surged. However, there were also prophecies of an impending "great disaster," and some were even more direct, saying that the Zheng family's end was near.

Although the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had no intention of spreading propaganda, this effect was an unexpected bonus.

With this map, he was confident he could conduct over-the-horizon fire, but without observation of the shell impacts, he couldn't make corrections. Due to the limited elevation, it was difficult to accurately identify targets by observing the fall of shot from high ground outside the city. Using a model airplane required advanced data transmission capabilities, and the models were too "precious" to be used frequently. After much deliberation, they decided to use a cruder method: once the bombardment began, they would temporarily erect a 9-meter-high aluminum folding ladder on top of the dune, secured with guy-ropes. A spotter would climb to the top to observe.

Ying Yu directed his men to dig a pit and set up the cannon. After confirming the position was correct, he carefully marked it with positioning stakes. The movement of a non-recoiling gun was too great; its position would shift significantly after each shot, making it difficult to make precise corrections. Although the Experimental Type 32 Battalion Gun was equipped with a friction-plate recoil absorption system, it wasn't a true recoiling gun. The gun carriage still moved slightly after firing. Ying Yu had tried many methods and finally settled on this simple, low-tech solution.

After setting up the gun position, he once again checked the cannon's position, angle, and direction against the map and compass points. Several team members grunted as they moved the ammunition boxes next to the gun and opened them one by one. Ying Yu took out a high-explosive shell, attached the fuse, and loaded it into the chamber, followed by the brass cartridge case that served as a gas seal. He then closed the breech and inserted the friction primer. When he was satisfied that everything was in order, he gave an "OK" gesture.

The team members began to drape camouflage nets over the cannon and the emplacement. They sprinkled water in front of the muzzle to suppress dust. Xue Ziliang squinted at the gradually brightening sky, estimating the right moment to begin the bombardment. They had 40 shells prepared for the Zheng mansion: half high-explosive, half shrapnel. The plan was to first bombard the mansion with high-explosive shells to throw the people inside into a panic and send them fleeing in all directions. Then, they would use shrapnel shells to fire over the fleeing crowd, inflicting indiscriminate casualties. Although most of the dead and wounded would undoubtedly be servants, there was no question they would be able to kill several important members of the Zheng family.

Once the Zheng mansion was in chaos, the navy would begin its bombardment of Anping. This would surely force the key figures of the Zheng family to flee the city, at which point the sniper teams positioned on the main roads could begin their slaughter.

Xue Ziliang looked at his watch. It was 4:50 AM. The radio operator reported that all teams had signaled they were in position. His spirits lifted, and he began to inspect the defenses around the dune. They weren't using smokeless powder, and the white smoke would quickly give away the cannon's position, so they had to be prepared for a counterattack from the city.

At 5:12 AM, the dull boom of a cannon was heard from far away, not much louder than distant thunder. Xue Ziliang and Ying Yu instinctively looked towards Weitou Bay. It had finally begun!

The cannon fire grew more intense, and thick black smoke began to appear on the horizon. Although Xue Ziliang didn't know the specific details of the battle, he could tell from the snippets of information coming from headquarters that the fight was going very smoothly. Of course, it was unlikely to be otherwise. In Xue Ziliang's eyes, this was nothing short of bullying.

Through his binoculars, he could see a commotion on the walls of Anping. According to reports from the other teams, the four gates of Anping were now tightly shut, with no one entering or leaving.

"From now on, keep a close watch on anyone entering or leaving Anping. Kill any individuals on sight," Xue Ziliang ordered into his walkie-talkie. "Report any unusual activity immediately."

Although he couldn't see clearly inside the city, bells and drums soon began to sound, apparently to rally people. This was followed by the mournful sound of horns. The soldiers on the city walls ran about like headless chickens. Soon, the entire wall was lined with defenders.

The fleet anchored below Anping also grew tense. Xue Ziliang noticed a sudden flurry of activity on the ships.

Xue Ziliang knew that armies of this era rarely risked marching at night. So even if Anping wanted to reinforce Weitou Bay, they would have to wait until daybreak. This meant the fleet reinforcements wouldn't arrive until at least 5:30 AM, and the land forces would be even later. The mobilization capabilities of medieval armies were very low; they couldn't deploy troops in a hurry. Furthermore, without information, the commanders would be indecisive, unable to assess the situation.

Cutting off communication between Anping and other locations was the most effective way to delay and disrupt the enemy's tactical deployment by preventing their main commanders from confirming the situation at the front.

"Raise the ladder!" Xue Ziliang commanded. Several team members immediately erected the aluminum folding ladder. When fully extended, it stood 9 meters tall. The men secured it with four guy-ropes. A spotter, with binoculars and a walkie-talkie hanging around his neck, scrambled up, climbing hand over foot to the very top. Ignoring the swaying of the ladder, he straddled the highest rung and used his binoculars to observe the situation inside Anping.

The town was in a state of chaos, but there were no signs of a large-scale troop concentration. Clearly, the Zheng family had not yet assessed the situation and made a decision. Xue Ziliang felt this was the perfect opportunity. He waved his hand. "Begin the operation!"

Ying Yu knelt on one knee and pulled the lanyard. The 70mm cannon bucked backward. The friction-plate recoil system did its job, and the recoil was minimal. With a roar and a cloud of white smoke, the shell soared into the sky. Xue Ziliang's eyes followed the shell's red tracer as it arched high over the walls of Anping and descended towards the Zheng mansion.

"Reset!" he shouted. Two team members pushed the wheels, aligning the gun with the marks they had made, and pushed it back into its original position.

Ying Yu opened the breech, and the hot brass cartridge case was ejected from the chamber. He took the second round from a team member and quickly reloaded. He waited for the spotter's report on the first shell's impact. He planned to use four shells to bracket the target. He estimated each shell would take about 15 seconds to land. Once the target was zeroed in, he would switch to rapid fire at a rate of one shot every 10 seconds.

*If only it were a mortar,* he thought with a hint of regret. *A mortar could easily fire one round every two seconds.* Although mortars were technically an infantry weapon, and not his specialty as an artilleryman, the principles of ballistics were the same.

The first ranging shot hit the main street in front of the Zheng mansion. It exploded in a ball of fire, sending bricks and stones flying and killing several pedestrians instantly. The tiles on the roofs of nearby houses were shaken loose and shattered on the ground.

Following the spotter's report, Ying Yu turned the elevation handle, raising the muzzle slightly, and fired the second shot.

The second shell scored a direct hit on the roof of the sedan chair hall, blowing a large hole in it and sending roof tiles flying.

Sweat began to bead on Ying Yu's forehead. He glanced at the map coordinates and used both hands to adjust the elevation and traverse handles. The third shell boomed out of the barrel.

The coordinates for the third shell's impact came over the radio. It had landed right on target: in the pond in the backyard of the Dunren Pavilion, where Zheng Zhilong conducted his business. It sent up a column of water, and several ornamental waterfowl were thrown into the air by the blast wave.

Ying Yu looked at the map again, knowing he had roughly zeroed in on the target. He made another slight adjustment to the handles. The fourth shell directly hit the covered walkway in the front courtyard of the Dunren Pavilion, instantly killing several attendants and personal guards who were waiting for orders.
