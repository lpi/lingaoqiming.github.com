From the very beginning, the Executive Committee had focused its work on the two children of the Gao family. Once an adult's mindset is formed, it is difficult to change. In contrast, the minds of teenagers and children are active, they have a natural contempt for authority, are easily moved by new things, they love adventure, and are eager to prove that they are no less capable than adults—all of which could be used by the transmigrators.

Each time they crossed over, they spent a lot of time with the two children to observe their personalities and abilities. Compared to Gao Lujie, Gao Di, as a boy, was more valuable—girls had a small social circle and rarely had the opportunity to show their faces. Gao Di was younger, and his mindset and character were much more malleable than his sister's.

Gao Di was intelligent and quick-witted. When [Xiao Zishan][y001] taught him some methods of bookkeeping and arithmetic, he learned them immediately. Sometimes [Wen Desi][y002] would specifically ask him to do a few small things, and he could also handle them properly. When given some modern candies and snacks as a reward, he would always take them back to share with his sister, which showed that his character was not greedy or selfish, and that he was a responsible person.

When they entered the study, they saw the brother and sister kneeling straight on the ground. Bei Wei's eyebrows twitched, as if he was about to get angry. [Wen Desi][y002] knew he couldn't stand such things and quickly stopped him.

"Get up. Why are you kneeling here for no reason? Do you think we are the city gods?" [Wen Desi][y002] raised his hand with a slight smile.

"We beg the masters to forgive our mother's crime." The two children did not get up, but said in unison and kowtowed together.

"I have already said before, the ignorant are not guilty," [Wen Desi][y002] said. "You both get up."

"Thank you for the master's grace." The brother and sister exchanged a glance, a look of joy on their faces, and quickly stood up.

"Gao Lujie, you go out first. I have something to say to Gao Di."

"This servant knows." Gao Lujie responded cheerfully and withdrew. Bei Wei stood up, walked to the window, and saw that Gao Lujie had already left, only then did he nod.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] asked, "Are you familiar with Guangzhou city?"

"Familiar. People in the Gao residence used to often send me on errands. I got a few coins each time."

"The companions I asked you about just now, do you still often play together?"

"A few have been chosen for jobs, the others are all idle at home with nothing to do. They often ask me to go out and play."

"Are there any reliable people among them?"

Gao Di suddenly raised his head: "Does master want to recruit household servants?"

*A clever child indeed*, [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought, nodding to himself.

"Not at the moment," he deliberately said vaguely. "This is not the same as selecting household servants, but it is somewhat related."

"Then please instruct me, master, what kind of person are you looking for?"

"I need a few children who are familiar with Guangzhou city to report the news and market prices on the streets every day," [Xiao Zishan][y001] told him one by one the market prices of the goods they wanted, based on what had been discussed beforehand.

"That's easy. You can find out by looking at the water boards at the teahouses of the various guilds."

"Compile all these things into a ledger every day, and do it according to the bookkeeping method I taught you."

"I understand."

"I will give you an extra tael of silver every month as an activity fund. You choose the people, but you must choose well. Unreliable people and those who love to gossip are not wanted. In addition, keep a close eye on the news from the Gao family." [Xiao Zishan][y001] stared intently into his eyes. "If anything happens, don't write it down. Wait until we come and tell us."

For every sentence [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, Gao Di would respond. He saw that the boy's face was a little frightened, but the excitement was overflowing.

"Does your family have any friendly people in the Gao residence?"

"Yes, Uncle Chang, my father's sworn brother. He works as a general servant in the outer residence." He then went on to say a lot more. This Gao Chang was from his father's hometown and had sold himself to the Gao family six or seven years ago after fleeing a famine. He was strong and knew some martial arts, so he could have been chosen as a household guard, but he was too blunt, had no money to bribe the managers, and ended up being disliked by his superiors. He had been a general servant until he was twenty-five or six and couldn't even get a rough maid for a wife.

"He's a bachelor?"

"Yes, but Uncle Chang is quite open-minded and doesn't complain much."

The few of them looked at each other. This was a suitable candidate for development: someone who was not appreciated in his original unit would be happy to jump ship. Being blunt meant he was straightforward and not scheming. Not complaining much showed that his mentality was peaceful. Finally, being strong and knowing martial arts was also useful.

Of course, these were all words from his nephew, so there might be some exaggeration. But now was a time when they needed people, so they didn't need to be too picky. Besides, whether a person was suitable or not could only be known after they were used.

"Should I call Uncle Chang over? He is not on duty today."

"Alright, you go and invite him."

"I'll just say that father is inviting him for a drink, and he will come."

What high comprehension. Without being told to keep it a secret, he had already understood. However, this child was so clever that if he was not handled well in the future, he would be a disaster. [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s thoughts were always a bit dark.

Before long, Gao Chang arrived. Under Gao Di's introduction, he came over to kowtow and greet them. They sized him up. He was not tall, but his physique was quite strong, and his movements were quite agile.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] only asked about his background and his work in the Gao family.

"...I have been a general servant in the outer residence for six years," Gao Chang reported.

"I see that you have a dignified appearance and your skills are not bad. Why have you always been a general servant?"

"I am clumsy by nature and not good with words, so I have always been a general servant."

"Have you ever married?"

"No..." Gao Chang blushed. "I am too poor, no woman is willing to be with me."

"You have served their family for these years, and the Gao family hasn't even assigned you a maid?"

"It is really that I am too poor. Even if I were assigned a woman, I'm afraid I couldn't keep her."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] thought, *this person is not bad*. His master had shown him no grace, yet he did not speak a single bad word about his master in front of outsiders.

"How does the Gao family treat you?"

"I am just a servant. It is a grace for the master to give me clothes to wear and food to eat." He spoke neither humbly nor arrogantly, and his demeanor was natural.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] glanced at Bei Wei. The former reconnaissance soldier suddenly jumped up and gave him a hard push. Gao Chang was caught off guard and stumbled backward, taking seven or eight steps back before he could stand firm. Although his face was full of surprise, he just straightened his clothes and continued to stand with his hands down.

Bei Wei nodded. This person's stance was very stable. He really did have some kung fu.

"You know martial arts?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] asked.

"Just some country kung fu, practiced for self-defense and health. I have made a fool of myself in front of the masters."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] nodded and asked no more questions, telling Gao Di to take him out for a drink.

Gao Di withdrew. The result of this interview was that everyone was quite satisfied, but how to recruit this person over still required another plan. The few of them discussed the work to be carried out in Guangzhou city. For now, they had developed their first intelligence network. The purpose of this intelligence network was not to collect any intelligence, but to see if Gao Di was capable of such a role, and also to verify whether the Gao family would be loyal.

If Gao Qing stubbornly continued to be Master Gao's spy, then the next step would be to find new people as soon as possible.

"I think Gao Qing's attitude towards Master Gao is also ambiguous," Bei Wei said. "Looking at his wife and children, they don't seem to be completely devoted."

"I agree with that statement," [Wen Desi][y002] nodded. "Gao Qing is merely intimidated by Gao Ju's power. In fact, he doesn't have much loyalty to his old master."

"Actually, what he fears more is having to leave his home and follow us. We now have the title of Australian sea merchants. He is not from Guangdong or Fujian, where people are used to going overseas."

"We will first try to win over his wife and children. After today, he will think carefully before he goes to report again."

"Will he still go?"

"I think he still will, but much less often. Gao Qing is timid and has no backbone. The old master's authority is still there, and he still wants to keep a way out. This person cannot be trusted until he is out of Gao Ju's sphere of influence."

"We need to have our own residence as soon as possible."

"Right. For now, we are looking for convenience in trade, but before the final transmigration, we must get a new residence."

"Gao Di is not bad, but it's a pity he's a child. He can't do things like buying a residence and servants."

"What about Gao Chang..."

"Someone's here!" Bei Wei suddenly shouted, flashing to the window. He casually picked up a rock from a potted plant and threw it out. There was a muffled thud outside. It seemed to have hit something.

The three urban nerds were all flustered for a moment, collapsing in their chairs, not daring to breathe.

"What happened?" [Wen Desi][y002] asked tremblingly.

"A black shadow flashed past the corner of the courtyard opposite," Bei Wei said resentfully. "To come and spy before it's even dark, what audacity."

"An eavesdropper?"

"Should be," Bei Wei said. "The route was winding towards the window."

"Is it Gao Ju's man?"

"Doesn't seem like it. Gao Ju already has eyes and ears here. Our business with him is going so smoothly, there's no need for him to do something like this that would anger us."

"Then who could it be?"

"I'm afraid it's those who are jealous of him," [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought of what Gao Ju had said when he gave them the residence: "It's just that recently, with these strange goods on the market, my place has attracted a lot of attention." This should be those who were "paying attention."

Things were becoming more and more complicated. Thinking of Gao Ju's uneasy look today, their thoughts were all a little tense.
