On the docks of Nanxiong Prefecture, many boats of all sizes were moored. This place was the water and land hub for traffic between the north and south of Guangdong. All merchants traveling south to Guangdong would cross the Dayu Mountains from Nan'an in Jiangxi, change to a boat in Nanxiong Prefecture, and could then travel straight down to Guangzhou.

Little Eunuch Yang—Yang Tianliang—and his party, who had come all the way from Beijing, were on two multi-storied boats. One was for him and his serving family members and maids, while the other was for the accompanying secretaries, managers, retainers, and guards. Neither of the two boats displayed any flags, plaques, or gauze lanterns to indicate their status. This was because Eunuch Yang was not only not a favorite in the palace, but was also struggling to protect himself. Displaying their insignia would only attract jealousy and bring no other benefits. Even if some officials were willing to entertain them, Little Eunuch Yang's temperament was most averse to greetings and send-offs. Therefore, along the way, whether by sedan chair or by boat, upon arriving at their lodging, they neither disturbed the post stations nor sent out calling cards. They just traveled silently. At this moment, having rested on the boat for a day, half of the fatigue from the journey had disappeared. The retainer-scholars were playing cards on the boat to pass the time and also invited Yang Tianliang to join, but he declined all of them.

It was not that he disliked the game of sparrows. It was that this trip south had a special flavor in his heart.

Yang Tianliang had been selected into the palace in the late Wanli reign and was assigned to Eunuch Yang. He was highly regarded by him and was adopted as his godson. Eunuch Yang was also one of Gao Shiming's confidants. Originally, relying on these two great trees, his future in the palace was bright. Unexpectedly, as soon as the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old came to power, Eunuch Gao Shiming resigned from his post to retire. His adoptive father was either sent to dig pits at the imperial tombs or was left idle in the palace. He himself had not had a proper assignment for three or four years. Fortunately, his past connections were still there, and he obtained the position of director of the Sutra Printing Workshop.

Usually, the father and son rarely met. Outside of official business, they were either managing their own properties. They did not say a word about the affairs of the palace and the court, striving to avoid suspicion.

However, in these years, the power of the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old was overwhelming, and the days of the father and son became more and more difficult. Seeing the sour scholars at court either tremble and submit, or be dismissed from office and demoted, from the intercalary sixth month of last year, starting with the Zhejiang governor Pan Ruzhen's memorial to build a living shrine for Wei Zhongxian, officials from all over the country纷纷 requested to build them. In a short time, there were already more than forty. This moved Eunuch Yang, who had been in a cold and idle position for a long time.

Currently, those requesting to build living shrines were all court officials and local civil and military officials. No eunuch in the palace had yet taken the lead. What if he also got involved? Not to mention the possibility of making the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old's impression of him change dramatically and making a comeback, at least he could leave an impression of being respectful.

But on second thought, it was not appropriate. He was not a confidant of the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old. To do so would not only be abrupt, but would also greatly offend Wei Zhongxian's confidants in the palace—one could not steal the limelight from others when flattering. After thinking it over, officials and gentry had already initiated the construction of shrines. Only the merchant class had not yet made a move. He could mobilize them. He had Gao Ju as a pawn in Guangzhou. Recently, he had also presented many novel overseas items, so he must have made a considerable fortune. He would just use his wealth and have him come forward to do this.

It was under these circumstances that Yang Tianliang was sent to Guangzhou. According to his adoptive father's instructions, this living shrine to be built in Guangzhou not only had to be grand in scale, but also had to show the "utmost sincerity" of the merchants. According to the current situation, as long as Gao Ju took the lead and contacted a group of merchants to submit a petition, the local officials in Guangdong would definitely not dare to refuse.

As for how much money this "grand and magnificent" living shrine would cost, Eunuch Yang couldn't be bothered. Anyway, Gao Ju had been under his care for so many years, it was only right for him to bleed a little—they were always a body of shared prosperity and loss.

However, Yang Tianliang did not see it that way. He thought a layer deeper than his adoptive father. There are no exceptions to the cycle of prosperity and decline in the world. The Nine-Thousand-Year-Old was now in a state of flowers on brocade, oil on a blazing fire. He wouldn't even notice this little bit of adding flowers to the brocade. But if he were to fall, this would become an ironclad proof that could not be washed away!

At this thought, he couldn't help but shiver. He looked around. He highly suspected that there were agents of the Eastern Depot among his entourage. Even just thinking about such things made him break out in a cold sweat.

Although he had been rushing on his journey, Yang Tianliang thought every day about how to advance and retreat in this matter to achieve the best of both worlds. He felt that his adoptive father was too short-sighted, always thinking about money, thinking that it would be over once he had Gao Ju pay for it. What about after this matter was over? The grand living shrine of the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old, whether it would be a monument or an ironclad proof, would depend on fate—the emperor was ten thousand years old, but the emperor's health did not seem like it could last for a thousand autumns and ten thousand generations...

What to do? He wearily pressed his brow and leaned back in his chair to rest for a while.

A young eunuch who was serving him tiptoed in. Seeing him with his eyes closed in rest, he did not dare to speak and just waited quietly. But Yang Tianliang knew someone had come in and snorted:

"What is it?"

"Replying to master, Master Gao's manager has been waiting at the dock for a long time."

"Let him in."

The manager came in and kowtowed to him. Yang Tianliang recognized him as Manager Gao Ye, who often came to the capital to deliver things to them. He was young, spoke and acted beautifully, and was a sociable person.

Besides welcoming and greeting on behalf of Master Gao, Gao Ye also brought a boatload of food, wine, and utensils, all exquisite and beautiful. He also brought a few young male and female actors for entertainment on the road.

The most peculiar thing, however, was a small wooden box. Gao Ye presented it last, saying it was a small token of Master Gao's esteem, specially bought from the Australian merchants at a high price.

The name "Australian merchants" was something Yang Tianliang had long been familiar with. In the spring, Gao Ju had mentioned in a letter that some new Australian sea merchants had come to Guangzhou with some novel goods. He had also sent some things over: crystal mirrors, lighters that could start a fire with a flick...

He opened the small, mother-of-pearl inlaid lacquer box. Inside were two small golden boxes, shining brightly, but they were neither gold nor jade. In the middle of the boxes were three strange patterns, and he couldn't tell what they were. In the middle was another small candlestick-like object, which seemed to be inlaid with niello, but the carving was very clumsy and the pattern was simple.

He looked questioningly at Gao Ye, who gently took out a paper box, carefully opened the lid, and inside was a sheet of shiny silver paper. Peeling off the paper revealed a neat row of small white sticks. A fragrant smell wafted out.

"Is it tobacco?" One of Yang Tianliang's small hobbies was smoking, and he immediately recognized the smell of tobacco.

"This is paper-wrapped tobacco from Australia. My master specially presents it to you." With that, he respectfully took one out and presented it to him.

Yang Tianliang held the cigarette. It was snow-white all over. One end was open, revealing light golden tobacco shreds. The other end was snow-white, tightly packed like silk floss. For a moment, he didn't know what to do with it. He smoked with a pipe, and had also smelled the snuff transported by the Westerners, but he had never seen anything like this.

Under Gao Ye's demonstration, he finally held the cigarette in his mouth, lit it with the candlestick-like lighter, and took a puff. He felt that the tobacco was very ordinary, the taste was rather light, and it was mixed with some unknown fragrance. But the way the paper-wrapped tobacco burned, glowing and dimming without going out or falling apart, was truly strange.

"It's just paper-wrapped tobacco, yet it's so pretentious. The same virtue as the Australian lighter your master sent last time." Although Yang Tianliang said this, he was very fond of the cigarettes. He played with the cigarette case in his hand, unable to put it down: this would be a good gift to present to the high officials and dignitaries of the current court.

"Manager Gao, are there more of these paper-wrapped cigarettes from the Australian sea merchants?"

"Yes, yes. The sea merchants brought quite a lot."

"That's good. When we get to Guangzhou, prepare a few dozen boxes for me, and that lighter must be included."

"I understand."

Seeing that Little Eunuch Yang was no longer speaking and had closed his eyes again, Gao Ye slowly withdrew.

As Little Eunuch Yang's boat slowly sailed down the river, the transmigrators sold another batch of goods. Cigarettes were a newly developed product. [Wen Desi][y002] took the opportunity to ask Master Gao to sell Gao Chang to them as well. Although everyone had thought of various plans to do this secretly, after considering it over and over, they always found it impossible to hide. Rather than engaging in such sneaky little actions that would only arouse suspicion, it was better to be open and aboveboard. Master Gao was somewhat surprised, but he thought it was a request from Gao Qing—to find a way out for this good-for-nothing sworn brother. Gao Chang was not a key figure, so he readily agreed and didn't even ask for a price.

Gao Chang came over with his own bedding. After meeting his new masters, he said he wanted to change his surname to Wen. The transmigrators had not thought about this kind of problem at all. Now that Gao Chang brought it up, they realized that changing one's surname was very important, a means for a servant to develop a sense of belonging to the master. However, changing his surname to Wen was not very appropriate, as the transmigration operation belonged to everyone. As they were discussing it, [Xiao Zishan][y001] proposed: instead of changing to some inexplicable surname, it would be better to simply restore his original surname. This would win his heart—Chinese people have always taken matters of ancestry very seriously. To lose one's own surname was a great shame, while to recognize one's ancestors was a great honor.

When they asked his opinion, the big young man actually knelt down and kowtowed several times with a loud thud, tears streaming down his face.

"I am grateful for the masters' grace in restoring my original surname. From now on, I, Sun Chang, belong to the masters. Through water and fire, I will do whatever the masters command!"

"What if we were to return to Australia, and never come back?"

"Wherever the masters go, Sun Chang will follow, to the ends of the earth, without a second word!" Sun Chang said with determination.

They had thought it would be very difficult to recruit a follower. Was it this easy? Our protagonist aura has finally emerged!
