"Do you have an acquaintance at the Qiwei Escort Agency?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] immediately followed up with a question.

"Indeed." Sun Chang said frankly, "The manager and escorts there are all from my hometown." It turned out that this Qiwei Escort Agency, from top to bottom, was staffed by people from Jiangxi, and their escort routes were limited to Guangzhou to Nanchang, Jiangxi. Many of the escorts in the agency were even Sun Chang's former martial arts brothers.

Whether to involve the escort agency, [Xiao Zishan][y001] did not dare to make the decision himself. After all, the matter was of great importance. After hesitating for a moment, he only said that they would discuss it again and instructed him to first close and guard the front and back doors.

On this side, the Executive Committee, having received the news, hurriedly convened an emergency meeting—someone had dared to kidnap a transmigrator! This was intolerable. They all wanted to teach them a lesson—besides finding Ran Yao, the former police officer, they also mobilized several mystery enthusiasts full of Conan Doyle and Christie. Xi Yazhou simply took out the few five-shot shotguns that had been hidden away. Someone suggested making a few hand grenades to "give the natives a taste," and someone else was preparing to make sulfuric acid bombs. Just as the crowd was in an uproar, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] stood up and said:

"We can't send so many people."

"Why?!" [Engineer Wang][y003] was furious and immediately questioned the person who objected.

"Sending so many people over would be adding to the chaos, not helping," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said. "That is Guangzhou of the Ming Dynasty. We are not familiar with it at all. What's the use of sending so many people? We don't even have a map. Even if we told you where [Chief Wen][y002] is being held, could you find him?"

The crowd looked at each other. It seemed that no one had thought of this problem.

"The problems of the Ming Dynasty should be solved by the people of the Ming Dynasty. To put it bluntly, this matter requires intelligence. As long as we know the whereabouts of [Chief Wen][y002], we can handle it in any way. A military rescue or a ransom, neither is a problem. With so many people going over in a chaotic mess, it wouldn't be easy for [Zishan][y001] and [Engineer Wang][y003] to explain to their collaborators over there either."

"Ransom? I can't believe you thought of that." Someone was already indignant. "We don't do soft-egg things!" This remark caused a buzz of agreement. Although the transmigrators were full of talk like: "Don't underestimate the wisdom of the ancients," and "The ancients were also very capable," in their hearts they were filled with the superiority complex of modern people—for "civilized and advanced modern people" to compromise with the "ignorant and backward ancients," just thinking about it would seriously hurt their feelings.

"If it can be resolved quickly and safely, compromise is not necessarily a bad method," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] insisted on his own view. "A military rescue, for one, we have no intelligence, and for another, it might pose a threat to [Chief Wen][y002]'s personal safety. Finally," he reminded everyone, "our goal is not to fight tough with the Ming Dynasty's underworld."

Seeing that everyone's emotions had stabilized a little, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] continued: "We will prepare with both hands. Ran Yao still has to go and check the situation at the scene. I believe his criminal investigation knowledge is sufficient. This is not some locked-room murder case, so the mystery buffs don't need to go."

A few mystery enthusiasts let out a weak protest.

"In case a military solution is needed, Bei Wei is already there. I propose that the Sports Group send two more people to assist him. Too many people would be a hindrance."

Lin Shenhe squeezed over and said, "I'll go too. Let me take that Emei small-caliber rifle. I've played with sniper rifles in the US, and I can hit a target within 500 meters without missing a shot."

"Alright, you go too."

"That's all the people." Seeing that there were still people eager to try, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] waved his hand to stop them and said to [Engineer Wang][y003], "You tell [Zishan][y001] that we should still try to use the strength of the Ming people as much as possible and not be too superstitious about military force."

"Alright."

With the discussion settled here, everyone was busy packing their equipment. Ran Yao brought his camera and criminal investigation notebook. He originally had a fingerprint collection tool, but it was useless—the Great Ming had no fingerprint files to check. The Sports Group brought three five-shot shotguns. There wasn't enough ammunition, and there was no time to load new cartridges. Each gun was only equipped with ten rounds. They also brought some reconnaissance equipment: night vision goggles, wireless beacons. They couldn't buy eavesdropping devices in a short time, but they could still get recording pens, microphones, and cameras. As for walkie-talkies, smoke canisters, tear gas grenades, gas masks, and other miscellaneous things, they packed two large backpacks full of them, useful or not.

Ran Yao, along with [Xiao Zishan][y001] and Sun Chang, inspected [Chief Wen][y002]'s room and the entire courtyard, and also drew a few diagrams. Sun Chang was more surprised to see several more Australians appear in the courtyard in just a few hours than he was to learn that [Master Wen][y002] had been kidnapped. Seeing this new Australian not saying much, but just silently searching around the house and courtyard, one moment climbing a ladder, the next lying on the ground looking with a small glass mirror, and from time to time scribbling on a notebook with a pen-like thing, he thought to himself that this must be an Australian constable—only wondering how this Australian constable had arrived so quickly.

After more than an hour of investigation, Ran Yao had generally understood the entire process of the crime.

"This is a case of multiple people working together." He introduced the situation to the murderous-looking rescue team in the room. The large square table in the room was stood up to temporarily serve as a blackboard, and the black-lacquered rosewood tabletop was being ravaged by chalk.

"This is the route the criminals took to get in." He drew a floor plan of the courtyard on the table. "The courtyard wall here is very high, almost 7-8 meters. It's impossible to get in with a human ladder. They should have used a kind of grappling hook. There are obvious scratch marks from the hooks on the top of the wall, and a large number of tiles have also fallen off."

"Is there really such a thing as a grappling hook?"

"Yes, I've seen some materials. Theft cases using such tools still occurred as late as the 40s and 50s."

"After the criminals got in, they first used knockout incense in the outer courtyard to knock out the servants, then came in and knocked out our four comrades one by one. The direction was from east to west. After waiting outside for some time, they then leisurely searched the various rooms.

"Then they twisted off the padlock of the room at the crossing point and tried to pry open the grate. There are at least three or four places on the grate with marks of being pried with an iron tool. Looking at the wear marks, it is very likely a crude knife or other similar long iron product.

"Finally, they took away the unconscious [Chief Wen][y002]. The route was to directly open the back gate of the courtyard and go out.

"Although the traces are not obvious, from the footprints extracted from the mud in the courtyard and the scuff marks on the wall, there are at least three sets of footprints of different sizes. There is another set of footprints outside the courtyard wall, so it is inferred that there were at least four people. The height of the criminals is between 1.55 meters and 1.60 meters. They carried special wall-climbing tools, weapons, and anesthetic drugs. They should be professional criminals.

"There is a rather peculiar phenomenon, which is that one of the four sets of footprints extracted was barefoot. Although it is a common phenomenon for ancient people to walk barefoot, this is Guangzhou city, not some remote small county. This point can be used as a breakthrough for the investigation."

"Do you mean those social groups that are accustomed to being barefoot?"

"Yes, at least it shows that there are people in this group of criminals who are accustomed to being barefoot. This is unlikely to be a special hobby of a certain individual, but should be a common habit of a certain social group."

"Then who could they be?" Everyone was puzzled.

"I am not a historian," Ran Yao said helplessly. In fact, this case would have no difficulty in modern times. The traces left by this group of people would be like they were not wearing pants under modern criminal investigation technology. It was a pity that this was the Great Ming of the 17th century. There were neither fingerprint files nor criminal record files to check, and he knew nothing about the social situation of this ancient city. The usual methods of handling cases were all useless.

Everyone was a little disappointed. They had originally thought that as soon as a professional criminal investigator was on the case, these petty scoundrels would immediately show their true colors. It seemed that it was not the case at all. Modern criminal investigation relies heavily on long-accumulated intelligence data and archives.

"Can you see anything else? For example, the motive or something." [Xiao Zishan][y001] continued to ask. "Was it premeditated, or was it a spur-of-the-moment thing?"

"It was premeditated. From reconstructing the entire crime process, the criminals had a very clear understanding of the courtyard situation. There are more than twenty rooms here, large and small, but knockout incense was only used in the inhabited rooms. I didn't find any drug holes on the windows of the uninhabited rooms.

"The reason they used knockout incense was obviously because they knew you had strong defensive capabilities. Otherwise, it would not have been so easy to succeed—[Chief Wen][y002] is a person who carries pepper spray with him at all times.

"And when Bei Wei introduced the situation, he also said that you had encountered someone sneaking in a few days ago. This should have been the criminals' reconnaissance operation.

"As for the motive, it is rather puzzling." Ran Yao rubbed his chin. "From the list of stolen items, it is clear that they came for property, but to kidnap only [Chief Wen][y002] seems to be a targeted kidnapping."

"Do they know [Chief Wen][y002]'s identity as an Australian sea merchant?"

"I think they definitely know." Ran Yao pointed to the stolen goods list. "This group of people is not only interested in silver, but also in your so-called Australian goods—they didn't take many of the Ming Dynasty's fine soft goods, but instead stole your modern small things like shoes, socks, and pens. It is clear that they came prepared."

"What do you mean?"

"This matter is not as simple as theft or kidnapping for ransom," Ran Yao shook his head. "I don't think kidnapping [Chief Wen][y002] was necessarily for the purpose of extortion."

Everyone discussed in a low voice for a while, and still agreed to use the power of the Ming people to gather information. [Xiao Zishan][y001] then called Sun Chang: "Call the manager of the Qiwei Escort Agency here."
