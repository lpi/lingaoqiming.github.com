"Without a unified ideology, without a clear guiding principle, we are doomed to fail." Du Wen's voice, sharp and clear, cut through the twilight.

The small group circling the athletic field walked on in silence. On the basketball and badminton courts, the games continued, but a few sharp-eyed players had already noticed the procession: the core members of the Executive Committee, accompanied by a few unfamiliar facesâ€”the undisclosed Policy Advisory Group, a collection of historians, lawyers, and sociologists. The young historian Yu E'shui was its leader, and the formidable Ms. Du Wen his deputy.

"Unify what thoughts?" [Ma Qianzhu][y005] finally broke the silence. "Will anyone even buy what you're selling?"

"It's a joke!" she shot back. "A political organization with no political goals, no unified ideology, and you expect to save the Chinese nation?"

"Save the Chinese nation," [Wen Desi][y002] mused. "Let's call that our ultimate ideal. It's more achievable than communism, at least."

"The goal for now is probably just to get rich and get laid," someone muttered. An ambiguous smile played on the lips of the men in the group.

"Pathetic!" Du Wen scoffed. "The limitations of the petty bourgeoisie are on full display. History has proven..."

"Let's not get sidetracked," Yu E'shui interjected, ever the moderator. "We don't need to define our long-term political goals right now. There are only three core issues: the power structure, the distribution of benefits, and our code of conduct."

"The Executive Committee is functioning well enough," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, his disinterest palpable.

"That's administrative supremacism," [Wen Desi][y002] countered. "The Committee is an administrative body, not a sovereign one."

"But it's efficient. A general assembly, with endless debate and voting... we'd never get anything done. The same people who curse democracy online will be the first to demand it here. We'll need a week of meetings just to dig a latrine!"

"And that is precisely why we need it," [Wen Desi][y002] replied. "This current state of affairs is a ticking time bomb. When the masses rise up to demand their power, we will be on the defensive." Better to shape the political landscape now, while the new arrivals were still disoriented and compliant.

The core of the Committee was a triumvirate: [Wen Desi][y002], [Wang Luobin][y003], and [Xiao Zishan][y001]. They had co-opted [Ma Qianzhu][y005] when his influence began to grow. It was a delicate dance of power, a game they all understood instinctively. For now, with no spoils to divide, most were content to be followers.

"So what will it be?" someone asked. "A representative system, or a general assembly?"

"A general assembly, obviously." With only five hundred members, a representative system was an unnecessary complication.

"And the natives who join us? We can't ignore their rights forever."

"In the early stages, their rights are not a concern," Dr. Zhong Lishi said, his voice a low drawl. He was a pragmatist, unburdened by sentiment. "Our relationship with the natives will be one of utilization and suppression. Those who cooperate will be rewarded. Those who do not will be crushed."

"That's no different from the Japanese devils! They are our compatriots."

"They have to recognize you as a compatriot first. With our faces, our clothes, our technology... who among them will see us as their own?"

"We must consider the interests of those who join us," Yu E'shui argued. "We can call them 'naturalized citizens.' To deny them political power would be to deny ourselves a broad base of support. Without the promise of long-term benefits, why would they risk their lives for us?"

"An integration policy?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] voiced his concern. "The naturalized citizens will eventually outnumber us. Our own power will be diluted."

"The fear of the masses! A classic petty-bourgeois trait!" Du Wen exclaimed, her voice dripping with scorn. "Only by mobilizing the masses can we hope to challenge the corrupt feudal regime! But you are all so concerned with becoming the new masters!"

"I envision a political system similar to ancient Rome," Yu E'shui continued, ignoring her outburst. "An aristocratic republic. All of us, the transmigrators, will be the new patricians. The Senate, composed of our members, will hold ultimate power. Within the Senate, we will have full democracy. For the naturalized citizens, we can establish a lower house, a 'plebeian assembly,' to represent their interests."

"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."

"Precisely," Yu E'shui agreed. "But that is for the future. For now, a simple structure will suffice. A General Assembly of all transmigrators, one person, one vote, for those over eighteen. The Assembly will elect an Executive Committee to handle administration. All major decisions will be put to a vote."

"A majority?"

"Two-thirds, with a quorum of ninety percent."

"And what if the majority is wrong?" someone asked. "What if, in a few years, they vote to colonize Australia or exterminate the Japanese? If we are a democracy, we must abide by their will."

"A valid point," Yu E'shui conceded with a smile. "If you find yourself in the minority, you have two choices: persuade the majority to your point of view, or seize power and become a dictator."

"Public opinion," [Xiao Zishan][y001] murmured. "The key is public opinion."

"Indeed. To control public opinion is to control the will of the people."

The group completed another lap of the track, Du Wen's critiques of bourgeois democracy a constant, droning counterpoint.

"Will we have a separation of powers? An independent judiciary?"

"Unnecessary, at least at first. The internal friction would be too great. We are too few to afford such luxuries. Our checks and balances will lie elsewhere."

"We are getting lost in the details," Qian Shuiting, the representative of the North American contingent, finally spoke. He was a biologist in his forties, a quiet man who had been listening intently. "The political system is simply a mechanism for distributing benefits. A unified ideology is a fantasy. We are a collection of individuals with a thousand different beliefs. Our only common ground is self-interest. We are, in essence, a joint-stock company. And the purpose of a company is not to save the nation, but to enrich its shareholders. Our members seek what all men seek: wealth, fame, women, power. Our cooperation will be born not of ideological purity, but of a shared desire for profit."

"And what happens when their personal interests are not met?" Du Wen challenged. "Those who join a revolution for personal gain will be the first to betray it. Only those who are willing to sacrifice for an ideal can achieve true greatness."

"And are you willing to sacrifice your life to establish a socialist paradise in the 17th century?"

"I will cultivate a generation of men who are," she answered, her conviction unwavering. The men in the group exchanged a look of weary resignation.

"We need a constitution," someone said. "Even the *Mayflower* had a compact."

"It's strange," Yu E'shui said, a thrill of excitement in his voice. "I feel as though we are a 17th-century ocean expedition. A band of misfits and dreamers, seeking a new life in a new world. We have new weapons, new technologies. We will arrive, at first, as humble supplicants, asking only for a small piece of land. And we will end as the masters of an empire."
