The online discussions covered both the preparations for the transmigration itself and the future policies of the new world: including organizational structure, military framework, industry, agriculture, education, political organization, and so on.

Every day, the message board of the discussion group would be filled with a large number of updates. Those who signed up for the transmigration operation could participate in synchronous discussions at any time.

Parliamentary democracy? Separation of powers? Constitutional monarchy? Totalitarianism? Nationalism? Socialism?

Everyone wanted to be the theorist of the new world.

The discussions were extremely heated, with all sorts of viewpoints and opinions emerging one after another. To be a tamperer of history, to usurp the Ming and overthrow the Qing, was the dream of many. But what kind of new world to build was clearly a matter of differing opinions. From democracy versus dictatorship, peace versus militarism, parliament versus centralism... all the way down to clothing styles, whether to implement universal compulsory education, what language the army should use for drills, and even the system of nobility, people were arguing about everything. For a time, saliva and curses flew together, and hats and clubs were of the same color.

The Executive Committee adopted an attitude of non-participation and non-commentary towards the heated discussions. Since everyone was willing to argue, let them argue to their hearts' content. It was better to argue now than on the beaches of Hainan. Moreover, people tended to reveal their true colors online, which could further deepen the understanding of these people and help select suitable core personnel.

It is hard to say what organizational form and election principles the Executive Committee was established through, or on what basis it chose who could enter the committee. This might seem incredible to modern people who value democratic rights. But on second thought, it was not strange at all: the transmigrators had not held a single general meeting during the year-long preparation period, nor had they ever elected anyone to any position. In fact, this was also impossible—the participants were always in flux. An active member of one meeting might not show up for the next, yet new people would ask to join. [Xiao Zishan][y001] had been trying to compile a list, and it was only after almost half a year that he basically succeeded. In a state of unstable personnel, the three people who had been presiding over the daily preparations for the transmigration—[Wen Desi][y002], [Xiao Zishan][y001], and [Wang Luobin][y003]—naturally became the core of the Executive Committee.

At this time, they were in no hurry to expand the Executive Committee. Although the three of them came from different backgrounds, living environments, educational levels, and work environments, they could understand each other tacitly in many aspects. When some people demanded to report for duty immediately, the Executive Committee answered in unison without discussion: the infrastructure was not yet complete, and they had to wait for another stage. They knew very well in their hearts that the more transmigration capital they accumulated in their hands at this time, the more important their position would be in the future power structure of the transmigration.

In [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s view, seniority was always a valuable intangible asset, no matter the time. Especially in such a social organization, the length of one's seniority often determined the weight of one's voice and prestige in the organization. Right now, their understanding of the situation of many transmigrators was limited. Letting them join too early would give some people seniority that did not match their abilities, which would be detrimental to future work.

[Wen Desi][y002]'s consideration was more practical: what this time-space did not lack were impetuous and boastful people—more than capable of ruining things, but not of accomplishing them. The best way to filter out these people was to use time to wear away their momentary impulse.

Of course, this period of silence could not be too long. The preparation work involved too much professional knowledge and skills, and it was impossible for the three of them to handle it all. The Executive Committee needed fresh blood. After a small meeting, they decided that it was not advisable to delay, and they would immediately cross over again to get enough money to enter the substantive preparation work.

"My master has given instructions. When you esteemed gentlemen arrive, please change your clothes first. The master will be out shortly." A manager respectfully welcomed them into a small courtyard.

The courtyard was small and exquisite, with lush flowers and trees, very elegant and quiet. On the table were several wooden trays with a complete set of clothes, towels, shoes, and hats.

[Wen Desi][y002] and the others did not yet know that Master Gao had gifted the powder boxes with mirrors, along with some other strange objects, to more than ten high-ranking officials and dignitaries with whom he had dealings, which immediately caused a sensation throughout Guangzhou. Glass mirrors, not to mention for the common people, even for the generally wealthy, were something they had heard of more than they had seen. Not to mention that the box itself was something unheard of. The number of buyers at his shop was endless. A powder box that cost ten taels was resold for fifty taels and was still snatched up in an instant.

Master Gao had been dealing in foreign goods for more than twenty years. Although he had built up a considerable business, this was the first time he had been in the limelight like this. In the past half month, the number of colleagues who had visited him truly lived up to the saying of wearing out the threshold. Every one of them wanted to get out of his mouth where the goods came from. This group of merchants, who were old hands at maritime trade, naturally knew that neither the Franks, the Red Hairs, nor the English merchants had this kind of goods, and it was not their shipping season either.

The biggest possibility was that a new overseas merchant had come to Guangzhou, and this sea merchant had been taken in by Master Gao. While many people were regretting how their own ears and eyes had been so closed, the number of suspicious characters loitering around the Gao residence and shop also increased. This made Master Gao vigilant. Although he had Eunuch Yang as a backer, none of the figures in Guangzhou who dealt in sea trade were to be trifled with. For now, he was much more careful, and had temporarily put aside the matter of buying a house that [Wen Desi][y002] had entrusted to him.

At this moment, Gao Ju could no longer be bothered with the suspicious aspects of these people. The greatest characteristic of a merchant is the pursuit of profit. What he was most worried about, on the contrary, was that the appearance of the Australian sea merchants was too conspicuous, which was why he had made these arrangements. He did not want people to know the details of his source of goods—this huge fortune must be firmly held in his own hands.

[Wen Desi][y002] and [Wang Luobin][y003] exchanged a glance, and they could roughly guess what Master Gao was up to. However, not attracting attention was in line with their wishes. So they changed their clothes.

Only, how to wear the clothes of the Ming Dynasty, they really had no idea. These men were not Hanfu enthusiasts. After a long struggle, they finally managed to put them on. The manager from outside came in to serve tea. Seeing their disheveled appearance with crooked scarves and slanted collars, he had no choice but to call a maid to help them dress.

The wealthy families of Guangdong had a custom of keeping maids. The manager also knew that these merchants were guests the master deliberately wanted to befriend, so the maids he called were naturally not bad. Both were fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls with bright eyes and good looks, charming and lovely. They came in, curtsied gracefully, and came forward to help them take off the clothes they had put on so clumsily. [Chief Wen][y002] considered himself a man who had seen some of the world, but being helped by the soft little hands of such lolis, having his clothes loosened and his belt untied, he was a bit overwhelmed. He thought to himself, *this is a man's paradise!*.

As his thoughts were wandering, he caught a glimpse of [Xiao Zishan][y001] also looking entranced. He laughed in a low voice:

"What, are you tempted too?"

"Yes, this is the life a man should live." [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought of the domineering attitude of his ex-girlfriend: feudal society has its bright side too.

"You bet!" [Wang Luobin][y003] also said indignantly. "Modern society is just a collapse of rites and music." He then went on to complain about how his wife, a graduate of the physical education department, was so and so, his resentment overflowing in his words, giving [Xiao Zishan][y001] and [Wen Desi][y002] a full understanding of the power of his wife.

The two maids with their hair in buns stood aside. Seeing [Wang Luobin][y003] talking non-stop, but not understanding much of it, they just saw his face full of passion and his constant gesturing. The scarf he had just put on straight had gone crooked again, dangling on his forehead. They both lowered their heads and pursed their lips to keep from laughing.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] nudged the impassioned [Wang Luobin][y003]: "[Engineer Wang][y003], what do you think of this little maid? Should we ask Master Gao to let you take her back?"

[Wang Luobin][y003] shook his head repeatedly: "She's a junior high school student! How could I lay a hand on her!"

"So you could if she were a high school student?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] continued to tease him. "Just raise her for a few years, and she'll be ripe..."

"Planning a loli-raising simulation?" [Wen Desi][y002] chimed in. "I'm quite interested." He then looked the girls up and down: although these two girls were a bit thin and small, they were fair-skinned and had delicate features. If they were given a bit more nutrition, they would be good material...

As the big gray wolves' eyes were roaming over the little white rabbits, the curtain was lifted, and Master Gao entered with a dignified air. Seeing this scene, he couldn't help but smile slightly. This group of sea merchants had been through wind and waves for years. When they came ashore, every one of them was a starved ghost for sex. Not to mention those Red Hairs and Franks—they would take any kind of woman.

But he didn't say much, just cupped his hands in a salute and said, "Esteemed guests, have you been well?"
