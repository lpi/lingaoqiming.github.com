As for being "unreliable," someone suggested equipping them with flintlocks—like the time-tested Brown Bess. But this proposal was opposed by the industrial department and the Planning Commission. The Brown Bess's design was completely different from the Minie rifle; aside from the stock, none of the parts were interchangeable, meaning a new production line would have to be set up for it. Moreover, the ammunition was not compatible. Expending a large amount of extra resources and manpower to arm a small number of troops was not worth the cost.

Finally, [Wang Luobin][y003], who was attending a meeting in Lingao, proposed a new solution: produce a "monkey model Minie rifle." Specifically, it would use the existing Minie rifle's design and share most of its parts, but the barrel would not be rifled.

Without rifling, the "monkey model" Minie rifle's range and accuracy were significantly reduced. However, it was still far superior to any matchlock or touch-hole gun of this era, and even had some advantages over a mature flintlock like the Brown Bess. It also maintained a technological gap with the regular army.

The "monkey model" Minie rifle didn't require any changes to the production line or special processing; it simply omitted the rifling step, saving manpower and resources. If needed, it could be converted back to the "standard version" by replacing the barrel, which greatly saved on labor and materials. The ammunition was also interchangeable.

Most importantly, the production of fulminate of mercury and percussion caps was a monopoly of the Senate. Even if the weapons were lost, whoever found them couldn't use them. This made them much safer than flintlocks, which could be easily repaired and used. In contrast, a Minie rifle without percussion caps was just an iron fire poker. To date, although hundreds of Minie rifles were "unrecovered," no other power had been found capable of using them.

This idea of a "monkey model" Minie rifle was quickly implemented, and the Japanese companies received the first batch of "Nanyang Rifles"—so named because, in the plan for the Pacification Army, they would be primarily deployed in Southeast Asia. This batch of rifles was not entirely new; some were refurbished rifles from the Fubo Army with worn-out rifling, refitted with smoothbore barrels.

Firearms training for the Japanese non-commissioned officers began first. The Nanyang Rifle received high praise as soon as it was put into use. Almost all of them had experience with matchlocks, whether it was the Japanese-made "monkey model" Tanegashima arquebus or genuine Portuguese and English matchlocks. The Nanyang Rifle's immense advantages in both accuracy and rate of fire left them speechless.

After the NCO squad leaders mastered the firing and maintenance of the Nanyang Rifle, the entire Banzai Camp assembled on the training ground the next morning.

"Today, you will be issued your weapons. Forward, march!" After the training sergeant gave the command, each training squad, under the command of their NCOs, ran in column to the armory.

Tables and gun racks had already been set up at the armory entrance. Each man was issued a Nanyang Rifle and a matching bayonet. The ordnance personnel were responsible for managing the issuance of weapons by serial number. Then, each training squad organized a session on the training ground to explain the weapon's structure and maintenance.

Shusen Shishikawa shouted, "Every rifle is engraved with the Senate's emblem—the Morning Star. Therefore, you must not treat it carelessly. You can tell a soldier's state of mind by how much he cherishes his rifle. So, you must take good care of your weapons!"

He was emotionally reciting the speech he had learned in his NCO training when suddenly a "clatter" came from the back of the formation. Everyone looked back. It was Private Mibei, who had accidentally dropped his newly issued rifle and was now frantically trying to pick it up. Shusen Shishikawa roared, "Get out!"

Mibei's face instantly turned pale.

"You idiot!" Before he could finish, the sound of slapping could be heard. Shusen Shishikawa yelled, "We're doomed with guys like you! You idiot! Everyone, attention! If you treat your weapon roughly, you'll be put in confinement and fed only once a day, you understand? You moron! You're punished to carry three rifles on your guard duty tonight!"

He then carefully explained the maintenance procedures for the rifle and bayonet, including disassembly and assembly. Then, everyone began to practice disassembling, assembling, and maintaining their rifles.

The Minie rifle's design was quite simple, but for someone with no concept of maintenance, it was still a difficult task.

"I've said it once, have you all memorized it?!" Shusen roared at all the soldiers. All education in the barracks was mandatory indoctrination, enforced through loud reprimands to force the soldiers to remember.

Rifle shooting training lasted for a week. Most of the Japanese mercenaries had experience with matchlocks, so they had little difficulty using the Nanyang Rifle. They adapted even faster than the new recruits of the Fubo Army, who had to spend considerable effort just to overcome their fear of firearms.

After 40 rounds of dry firing and 20 rounds of live firing, the troops moved on to bayonet training. After eight weeks of training, the basic training for the Japanese battalion of the Pacification Army was declared complete, and the unit was officially formed.

Of the more than 370 Japanese mercenaries who had signed up to fight for the Senate, four Pacification Army companies were ultimately formed. They still had a hundred-man establishment, but the companies had no drummers or fifers, only buglers and standard-bearers. The company and platoon level officers and the company quartermaster were temporarily filled by naturalized citizen soldiers drawn from the regular army. Following the principle of "low rank, high position," sergeants from the regular army served as platoon leaders, and staff sergeants as company commanders, with their ranks unchanged but receiving the corresponding duty allowances.

The organization and employment of the Pacification Army were decided based on the discussions at the "Danzhou Seminar."

Towards the end of the Northern Qiongzhou Pacification Campaign, the proposal to establish a dedicated Pacification Army had already emerged. To fully utilize the Pacification Army, the General Staff held a "Field Seminar on Counter-Insurgency and Pacification Warfare" in Danzhou. Xue Ziliang presented the methods, ideas, and lessons learned from a series of counter-insurgency operations he had directed in Danzhou.

One of the main lessons from the conference was that while maintaining sufficient mobile forces for offensive operations, it was crucial to ensure effective control and management of strongpoints and population centers. In governed territories, militias and a National Army could be organized. But in newly occupied areas that had not yet been "civilized," a sufficient pacification force was necessary to control the main population centers, intimidate the local elites, ensure the enemy could not receive supplies and personnel from the populace, protect the local administration, and ensure the smooth implementation of government decrees.

The Pacification Army formed for this purpose did not need a large establishment or combined arms capabilities. They didn't need their own logistics or heavy fire support units; these would be provided by the regular army. Even their drill and tactical training could be greatly simplified, without overly complex formation changes or coordinated tactical training.

Combat training emphasized shooting, grenade throwing, hand-to-hand combat, field engineering, and riot control. Tactically, the focus was on patrols and defensive operations.

Because the Pacification Army was deployed and operated in a dispersed manner, the largest tactical unit was the company. Above the company was the detachment, which served as an administrative and logistical support unit, with a variable number of companies under its command. This was suitable for the needs of dispersed deployment and flexible configuration.

After graduating from the "Banzai Camp," they were sent to the naval training brigade in Bopu for two weeks of sea voyage adaptation training and shipboard hand-to-hand combat training, to make final preparations for their departure. The Banzai Camp, as part of the Pacification Army's advance party, would be transferred to Taiwan, with a portion later dispatched to Jeju Island.

The naval training camp was located in Bopu. Almost all its facilities were the work of Minister of the Navy Ming Qiu. Unlike the armchair admirals who were experts on military history and equipment, Old Ming had worked his way up from the ranks in the PLAN and had his own unique insights into training and leading troops.

"Critique!"
"At ease."
"First Marine Company's landing and deployment was fast, but your equipment is all wet. How are you going to fight?!"
"Second Seaman Battalion's combat training is halfway done, and some of you are still hitting the rigging. Are you planning to fight pirates with your bellies?!"
...
Serving under Commander Ming meant getting yelled at daily was a must. But as an old navy man, being strict on the training ground was just Ming Qiu's professional habit. After dismissal, he would immediately mingle with the officers and men. However, as an old navy man, Ming Qiu was used to fast boats, submarines, and aircraft; his dreams were of sharp bows cutting through white waves. He was a complete amateur when it came to maneuvering sailing ships and forming lines of battle, and he hadn't quite figured out how to command the most powerful surface fleet of this era.
...

"Kill!"
"Ha!"
"Thrust!"
"Hooah!"
"Five-minute break! You can use the latrine, but don't wander off!"
"Yes, sir!"
"Dismissed!"

Shusen Shishikawa and seven or eight other Japanese men, holding Nanyang Rifles with fixed bayonets, walked to the shade of a tree to drink water. They watched a group of Australians in the distance, marching in a strange formation, carrying strange flags and bamboo poles. They would stop frequently to point or go back to a certain spot and walk again. They couldn't understand what they were practicing.

Ming Qiu and his officers, oblivious to the pointing Japanese mercenaries in the distance, carried on with their own training.

Strictly speaking, this couldn't be called training. It was a tactical simulation method invented by Admiral Ming, similar to how pilots in the old world would use small model planes on the ground to practice various flight maneuvers. The difference was that now, each captain led a few of his men in a line to simulate a ship. The Type 901 and Type 854 Mod were the prized possessions of the Senate. The Senate and the Executive Committee were wary of the pirate-born naval personnel, so when appointing the first batch of key officers, they prioritized "reliability." As a result, the ship-handling and tactical abilities of the officer corps of these "capital ships" were actually lagging behind.

To make up for this shortcoming, training had to be intensified. The time they had for training was very limited. They were about to set sail on a mission, so specific seamanship training could only be done while underway. Tactical training had to start in advance.
