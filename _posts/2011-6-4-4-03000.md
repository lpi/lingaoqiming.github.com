Finally, at Li Luoyou's request, Liu San took them to the power workshop to see the "power of steam." Li Luoyou was startled by the boiler workers, who were covered in black soot, with only the whites of their eyes visible. They were constantly shoveling black coal into the roaring furnaces. As for the large iron box called a "boiler," it was emitting wisps of white steam from all over.

The movement of the steam engine's piston, connecting rod, and flywheel left Li Luoyou and Quark speechless for a long time. The sheer power demonstrated was overwhelming.

"If only the Australians could build such a cannon factory for the Great Ming..." Li Luoyou immediately shook his head. How could that be possible! Not to mention that Wang Zunde couldn't afford it, even if the imperial court were to fund it, the appropriation alone would probably cause a huge uproar in the court.

This cannon factory was worth at least a million taels of silver. Besides, where would they find so many skilled craftsmen? The craftsmen he hired in Foshan could at most melt and pour iron; they wouldn't know how to operate machines.

At this thought, his enthusiasm waned. It seemed this trip was a failure: buying cannons was impossible, and setting up a cannon factory was even more hopeless. The trade deal he had made with the Australians was good, but he was already making a lot of money, and an extra hundred thousand taels a year was not a huge deal.

His waning enthusiasm killed his interest in continuing the tour that day. He made an excuse of feeling unwell and returned to Runshitang.

After sending them back, Liu San immediately went to the Executive Committee to report the whole situation, including Li Luoyou's attempt to bribe him.

"He seemed to become very dejected after seeing our arsenal."

"He probably thinks we can control the power of ghosts and spirits and was scared out of his wits," Wen Desi said. "According to the intelligence department's files, this Proprietor Li has the potential to be a big Ming loyalist. After seeing the production process, he probably had a premonition that the Ming Dynasty is doomed."

"Wouldn't that be asking for trouble? He might go back and lead the Ming army to attack us."

"Attack us? Will he pay for the troops and provisions?" Wu De scoffed. "It's not a bad thing for the government to know a little about our strength. At least it lets them know this place is not an easy nut to crack."

"I think you could have totally accepted his bribe," Wu Nanhai, who happened to be at the compound for business, chimed in. "You could have said that through your efforts and lobbying, you finally got them to agree to build a 'monkey version' of the cannon factory, and for that, you had to mobilize all the members of the Executive Committee, spending countless favors..."

"Alright, stop joking," Ma Qianzhu interrupted Wu Nanhai's idea of "increasing assets through alternative means." "The image we want to project now is one of integrity and public service. It's not worth tarnishing our reputation for this little thing."

"I think so too." Liu San thought to himself that his hopes for the ginseng were now dashed.

That evening, Liu San visited Li Luoyou with a mysterious expression and told him: the higher-ups have said that selling cannons is not possible, but they can sell him the equipment for a cannon factory.

Li Luoyou was stunned. This was what he had always wanted, as the saying goes, "give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." But after seeing the cannon foundry yesterday, he had completely given up on such fantasies—he couldn't afford such a factory even if he sold everything he owned.

"Thank you for your efforts, Master San, and for the kind intentions of your superiors. But I'm afraid I am incapable of building this cannon factory," Li Luoyou said with a bitter smile and a cupped-hand gesture. "Before coming to Lingao, I thought I was well-traveled and knowledgeable. After yesterday's visit, I realize I was just a frog in a well!"

Liu San was taken aback. He had expected Li Luoyou to be overflowing with gratitude, but instead, he heard these words, which clearly implied it was too expensive. Thinking back, what they had seen yesterday was indeed too overwhelming. There must have been a misunderstanding.

"This is a simplified cannon factory," Liu San said, gesturing for a long time. He wasn't from an engineering background, and he was facing a native of this era. Li Luoyou was not ignorant of science; if it came to algebra and geometry, he was probably better than Liu San, who had returned all his high school math to his teachers. But he was completely ignorant of industrial production.

After a long and strenuous explanation, he finally made Li Luoyou understand his meaning: the Australians were willing to provide a set of simple equipment adapted to the Ming's level. This set of equipment could produce cannons in Foshan, with higher quality and efficiency than traditional methods.

"Will it produce Australian cannons?"

Li Luoyou had never seen an Australian cannon fire, but he had heard a lot about them: they were extremely accurate, had a very long range—dozens of li per shot, and so on. And yesterday at the foundry, the production process had given him the impression that these cannons were extraordinarily powerful—if it were just an Australian version of a Hongyi cannon, they wouldn't have needed such精工細作 (jinggong xizuo - meticulous craftsmanship).

"This set of equipment is specifically for making Hongyi cannons," Liu San said. "The cannons produced will still be Hongyi cannons, but they will be better than the ones made by the red-haired barbarians."

"I see!" Li Luoyou was slightly disappointed. But on second thought, his original plan for the foundry in Foshan was to make Hongyi cannons anyway. This trip was still worthwhile.

Subsequently, the foreign trade department presented a contract. It stipulated that Lingao would provide Li Luoyou with a full set of equipment and production technology for a simple cannon factory, and would be responsible for installation and training of workers, as well as providing one year of maintenance and spare parts services. The total value of the contract was equivalent to fifty thousand taels of Kuping silver.

Li Luoyou gasped when he saw the price. This was even more expensive than the British cannon factory equipment quoted by Quark! Quark's estimate, including shipping, was forty thousand Spanish silver dollars. The craftsmen were to be paid separately: the highest-paid would receive two hundred and twenty taels of silver per year, and the lowest one hundred taels. The total labor cost would be less than two thousand taels a year.

This investment would probably not be recouped even if he made cannons for Wang Zunde for ten years. Not to mention his own investment in the project, it was a question of when the Guangdong Provincial Administration would fully reimburse him for the cannons he produced.

Li Luoyou's loyalty to the emperor and his merchant instincts wrestled in his mind for a long time. He couldn't make a decision.

"Is it really impossible to sell cannons?" He still hoped to buy cannons directly. Fifty thousand taels could buy a lot of cannons, and the effect of bringing back Australian cannons would certainly be more impressive than bringing back a set of equipment. Although he was fronting most of the money, it was still a government-supervised, merchant-operated venture. If he made a big show of acting under the government's banner but failed to produce significant results, the Provincial Administration would not be pleased. Many people were eyeing his position, and this could become a major handle for them to use against him.

"In principle, no," Liu San said, using official jargon. Seeing Li Luoyou's pained expression, it was clear he was hurting over the money.

"Allow me to reconsider."

That night, when Liu San returned to his office in Runshitang and was about to rest, take a bath, and have some fun with Xuan Chun—their relationship was growing deeper, and Xuan Chun had become much more open and proactive than before, when she used to just lie there and let him do as he pleased. Just as he was thinking about what new tricks to try that night, Fu Wu came to report: Master Han is here to visit.

"Master Han?" Liu San was surprised. This man was Li Luoyou's personal advisor and confidant. Why was he visiting him suddenly?

"Please, show him in."

As he spoke, Master Han had already entered. He was about fifty years old, with drooping eyelids that made him seem listless, but when he occasionally lifted them, his eyes glinted with sharpness.

"Master San," Master Han bowed deeply, very politely. "I have come to disturb you!"

He spoke in Mandarin, but with a Southern Min accent. Behind him were two servants carrying food boxes.

"You're too kind, too kind," Liu San quickly returned the courtesy and invited him to sit in the main room.

"My master brought some excellent Wuyi tea, a tribute for the emperor. I saw that the tea here is not very good, so I'm borrowing this flower to present to the Buddha, to share with you, Master San."

As he spoke, the two servants were already busy setting up the tea set and stove. Liu San saw that it was the so-called "gongfu tea," though with slight differences in form and style.

The servant lit the stove and put a pot of cool water on it. Master Han gestured for them to withdraw.

The stove used top-grade red charcoal, and the cast-iron kettle was small, so the water was soon lightly boiling.

"It's a pity there's no good spring water, but the Yang family is an old family after all! They even have rainwater from the previous year!"

The Wuyi tea from Fujian, the exquisite utensils, and the perfectly prepared brew. Although Liu San didn't know his purpose, he adopted a go-with-the-flow attitude, sipping the tea, admiring the tea set, and making small talk with Master Han, appearing extremely comfortable and casual. Master Han also deliberately avoided talking about business, focusing all his efforts on socializing, hoping to deepen their friendship in a short time.

After the tea had been changed once, Master Han finally said, "I have come today on behalf of my master, specifically for the matter of the cannon factory."

Liu San nodded. As expected, he was here to bargain. It was normal to bargain for a large transaction, but the Executive Committee and the Standing Committee of the Yuanlaoyuan were fiercely debating this issue. Wu De's plan to sell the equipment had only barely passed, so if the price of fifty thousand taels were to be discounted, it would likely become the best ammunition for the opposition.

Seeing Liu San's troubled expression as soon as he heard his purpose, Master Han became even more certain of his plan. He was indeed sent by Li Luoyou, but he had another objective.

Master Han praised Lingao for being "peaceful and prosperous," complimented them, and then stated his request:

"The price of this cannon factory, I wonder if it can be lowered a little?"

Liu San naturally shook his head. The foreign trade department had only given him the authority to quote a price, not to negotiate business.

Master Han then hinted that in any business deal, there was always some "padding" in the price. If Liu San could lobby for a ten or twenty percent reduction in the price, Li Luoyou would surely reward him handsomely, be it with silver or women.

"I'm afraid I can't help," Liu San continued to shake his head. "It's not that I'm being difficult, but the rules have been set from above: it won't be sold for less than fifty thousand taels." He said in a friendly tone, "I hope you can understand."

This was a final word. There was nothing more to discuss. Liu San was too lazy to continue the charade, speaking in circles with false courtesy.

Unexpectedly, Master Han didn't leave. Instead, he started a new line of conversation. "My master is very fond of your machines. It's just that the price is too high, and he can't make up his mind. He's on the fence. To be honest, whether this deal goes through or not depends on a single word, a single thought."

Liu San didn't understand what he meant. It was all empty talk! Thinking about it again, he suddenly understood: Master Han was making his move.

The deal could be done, and at their quoted price, but Master Han himself wanted a cut.

First, he tried to bribe him to lower the price. When that failed, it turned into a solicitation for a bribe. This was a truly creative way of doing business! Liu San thought that the transmigrator group strictly forbade accepting bribes, but giving bribes was not a problem—this was a society where bribery was rampant, and nothing could be done without it.

"I wonder how big a 'hat' Mr. Han wants to wear?" Liu San probed.

"Hehe, Master San is truly straightforward," Master Han said. "The total price of forty thousand has already been reported. The hat cannot be worn."

"How much is the commission?"

"Ten percent," Master Han said, holding up two fingers.

"Ten percent?" Liu San almost shouted. That was five thousand taels—definitely impossible. Not to mention ten percent, even a thousand-tael kickback was out of the question. There were already many people who opposed this deal. If a huge kickback was exposed, it would become a ready-made target!

There was no need to even report it—Liu San directly refused.

"Won't Master San reconsider?" Master Han said, squinting and sipping his tea.

"I really can't do anything," Liu San shook his head.

Seeing his firm attitude and no room for negotiation, Master Han sneered slightly.

"The Australian machines are indeed good, but they are still just iron tools."

Hearing this, Liu San was furious. This Master Han changed his tune faster than one could flip a book. He also sneered, "Mirrors are made of sand, yet people still rush to buy them with real gold and silver."

Master Han, however, gave a mysterious smile and took his leave. Liu San was left completely baffled, not understanding Master Han's meaning until the very end.

When Li Luoyou received Master Han's report, he knew that there was no hope of getting a private discount. He then discussed with Master Han whether to buy the cannon factory or not. Li Luoyou rarely consulted others on business matters, but this time he really couldn't make up his mind.

Master Han pondered for a moment and said, "Master, you have seen the abilities of the Australians. I won't say more. But the fact that no one in the Great Ming knows how to use these machines is a problem..."

"According to this Master San, they will help train craftsmen to operate them."

"The Australians have always been true to their word, so we can overlook this matter," Master Han said. "But the price the Australians are asking is not low. It's fine for the first year, but what if after a year, the Australians 'hold the machines for ransom'?"

These words were like a bucket of ice water poured over Li Luoyou's head. Only the Australians knew how to use the machines, and only they could manufacture them. If they broke, only they could fix them. This was a big problem!

"Master, the contract only covers repairs and training for the first year!" Seeing his master's face change drastically, Master Han knew his words had hit home. His meaning was clear: if the Australians demanded an exorbitant price in the second year, would he use the machines or not? If he used them, he would be exploited. If he didn't, wouldn't the expensive machines he had worked so hard to buy become a pile of scrap iron!

"Master, the Australian machines are indeed good, but they are not like local craftsmen. If Zhang San can't do it, Li Si can. If Li Si can't, Wang Wu can. You can always find someone who can. Besides, you are serving the court. If you ask someone to come and they refuse, that's showing disrespect, and you can just ask the government to deal with them! They are not like the British craftsmen invited by Mr. Quark—they rely entirely on you here and are completely lost outside. The Australians' skills are their own, and they have a base in Lingao. It seems the government can't do anything to them. What if they refuse to come and repair them?"

"The Australians have always been true to their word; they wouldn't do such a thing." Li Luoyou's confidence was already shaken.

"Master, let's not talk about that for now. The Australians are ultimately people from beyond our civilization. The court can't possibly ignore Lingao forever. When they send troops to attack, and the war drags on for years, the Australians won't be able to come to the mainland, and we can't dismantle the machines and send them to Lingao. Wouldn't that be a troublesome matter?"

"Exactly!" This was a very serious concern. "What is your opinion?"

"I believe that to have no worries, we must spare no expense to recruit a few Australian craftsmen to come to the mainland to maintain them," he continued. "It's just a matter of winning their hearts with great wealth and women."

Master Han didn't say not to buy, but said something that was fundamentally impossible.

"This is completely unworkable." Li Luoyou had already considered this. Liu San had refused him flatly, only agreeing to train craftsmen for him. As for privately recruiting Australian craftsmen, he was a stranger in a strange land, and the Australians seemed to be heavily guarded. It was simply impossible.

He couldn't help but let out a long sigh.

"This piece of junk, it's a disgrace to even build it," a few technicians said, gathered around a table in the machinery factory office. On the table were several sets of three-view drawings of the equipment, just transferred from the Great Library.

The so-called cannon factory equipment consisted of only five things: a power engine, a gearbox, a pulley block crane, a bellows, and a cannon boring machine. The three-view drawings were all based on actual equipment drawings from the 18th and 19th centuries, absolutely time-tested old equipment.

After discussion, everyone agreed that wind power was probably unreliable in a place like Foshan. It was better to rely on water power. The factories of the early industrial revolution almost all used water power on a large scale. Water power was more reliable than wind power and could maintain continuous production. It was the most suitable large-scale power source before the steam engine.

A water-powered engine combined with a gearbox could drive a much larger bellows than human power, providing oxygen to multiple iron-smelting furnaces at once, and the cannon boring machine could also be powered by water.

"It will only take a week to manufacture this set of things," Zhan Wuya announced after looking at it for a while.

"I think it's quite boring. Although it doesn't consume many resources and man-hours, it still feels like a pointless thing to build," Xiao Gui commented. "It would be more satisfying to just sell cannons and matchlocks to that Proprietor Li. At least the apprentices could get some practice."

"Selling guns and cannons is idiotic!" Sun Li jumped up. "Selling equipment is crazy! I think Wu De is a traitor to the transmigrators! I'm going to initiate an impeachment!"

"What's a 'traitor to the transmigrators'?"

"Don't talk nonsense! I think Wu De's idea of selling equipment is not bad," Zhan Wuya said. "Create an industrial model, let the rich people over there see that using machines can increase efficiency and make money. Let everyone do it together, at least let Guangdong slowly establish a primitive primary industry. This way, we can import primary finished products instead of always buying raw materials and processing them ourselves. Besides, a few simple pieces of equipment can earn tens of thousands of taels. This is a good deal!"

[Note: I don't know if the British equipment was worth this much; it's just a random number. The craftsmen's salaries are based on the salaries of Portuguese soldiers hired to operate and train with firearms in the late Ming. At that time, the highest was one hundred and twenty taels per year, with a monthly food allowance of ten taels.]
