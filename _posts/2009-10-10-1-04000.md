"They are all settled in Room 106 of Building 7," [Xiao Zishan][y001] reported, consulting a folder out of habit, though he had already memorized the details.

"Meng Xian, twenty-five, has lived abroad, fluent in English, with a background in finance and accounting."

"Pan Feng, twenty-eight, unemployed. Claims experience as a sales representative in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. Single."

"Zha Wuchu, twenty-four, a technician from a pharmaceutical factory. Single."

"Tian Jiujiu, twenty-seven, a technician from the X City Water Conservancy Design Institute, specializing in water supply and drainage. Single."

"Excellent," Wei Aiwen declared, slamming his hand on the table with a pointed glance at [Xiao Zishan][y001]. "All useful professionals, save for one."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] understood the jibe, but he held his tongue. He had learned long ago that to argue with a man like Wei Aiwen was to wrestle with a pig in mud. He knew his place in this room, a place earned not by technical skill but by his ability to navigate the complex social currents of their burgeoning society.

The others nodded silently as he continued. "I've spoken with them all. They are enthusiastic and seem committed to the project." This "chat" was the first layer of their screening process, a casual conversation designed to gauge a newcomer's temperament and team spirit.

"Meng Xian is a firearms enthusiast. He trained in moving target shooting and showed great interest in our arsenal."

"Pan Feng is more reserved. His hobbies are gardening and literature. He's also a certified accountant and has an encyclopedic knowledge of the FMCG industry."

He provided a brief summary of his impressions, then presented a list of the personal belongings each had brought. "I will submit my report to the Internal Affairs Group tonight. They will conduct the next stage of assessment. Someone has already been assigned to live with them."

"Who?" [Wen Desi][y002] asked.

"I'm not privy to that information," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a slight shrug. "Internal Affairs handles it from here."

Their eyes met for a moment, a silent understanding passing between them.

"As of today," [Xiao Zishan][y001] announced, "we have 476 effective check-ins."

Of the more than two thousand who had once dreamed of crossing the wormhole, fewer than five hundred remained.

"How many have we lost?"

"Fifty or so. These 476 are the ones who have committed. Another fifty are expected in the next two weeks."

"The 'Thousand Nobles' have become the 'Five Hundred Man Council,'" Wei Aiwen lamented. "Too few. All talk and no action."

The others remained silent. The question of numbers was a paradox. For the Executive Committee, a smaller, more manageable group was preferable. The masses were compliant for now, but familiarity could breed dissent.

"A lean and capable team is better," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said, ever the diplomat.

"We have talent in every field," [Xiao Zishan][y001] added. "Though we are short on women. Most are here with their husbands or boyfriends. Few are single."

"It is the way of things," [Wen Desi][y002] said with a sigh. "Who with a family would embark on such a mad venture?"

"Women are nothing but trouble," Wei Aiwen declared.

"Then don't come crying to the organization for a wife when we get there," someone shot back.

"As if I would! Ancient beauties, I'll have my pick. One to massage my back, one to rub my waist..."

Xi Yazhou cut him off. "You talk like a child. No woman would have you with that attitude."

"It's alright, Little Wei," another voice chimed in. "Brokeback Mountain was quite fashionable in the Ming Dynasty..."

"You're the one who's Brokeback Mountain!" the young man sputtered, his face flushing. "Your whole family is Brokeback Mountain!"

"On another matter," [Xiao Zishan][y001] interjected, "we have a request from an applicant who wishes to bring his foreign girlfriend."

"Foreigners? Absolutely not! They will be nothing but trouble."

"I agree. Those not of our race will never share our heart."

"This case is... special," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said. "Ding Ding, male, 32, a reporter. His girlfriend, Panpan, is an American."

"A Western chick!" Wei Aiwen's head popped up. "Photos?"

"She's someone's girlfriend, you degenerate."

"We must investigate! She could be a spy, sent by the FBI to stop us from rewriting history!"

"Do you even know what the FBI does?" [Luo Duo][y011], the resident pedant, chimed in.

"Whatever! They protect the president!"

"Should we let you investigate her?"

"I will complete the mission assigned to me by the organization!" the young man declared with a solemnity that silenced the room.

[Wen Desi][y002] nodded. "I see no issue. She is a family member. If she wishes to come, let her. Who would she be loyal to in that new world?"

"Very well. I will confirm with him. We could use someone with a media background."

"We need talent, yes," [Wen Desi][y002] said, his tone serious. "But we also need ordinary people. When we welcome new arrivals, we must not favor the skilled over the unskilled. Unity is paramount."

Meng Xian lay on his bunk, staring at the luggage piled on the bed above. The initial thrill of arrival had faded, replaced by a gnawing panic. *What have I done?* he thought. *I've thrown away a good life to chase a fantasy.*

He had dreamed of changing history, of building a new China, of glory and adventure. But the reality of it, the finality, was a cold weight in his chest. To pass through the wormhole was to die to this world. His parents, his friends... they would never know what became of him.

He sat up, his heart pounding. His roommate, Ye Yuming, was also awake, staring into the darkness.

"Can't sleep?" Ye Yuming asked, tossing him a cigarette.

"I don't smoke."

"What's on your mind?"

"I don't know when we're leaving," Meng Xian sighed. The waiting was the hardest part. If they had already crossed, he would have no choice but to accept his fate. This limbo was unbearable.

"You're that eager to go?"

"Aren't you?"

"It feels... unreliable," Ye Yuming admitted. "If it weren't for [Director Wen][y002] and [Director Ma][y005], I'd think it was a scam."

"It can't be, can it?"

"I don't think so. But what happens when we get there? What if the wormhole collapses? What if there's an accident?" His voice was low, his expression grave. "There's no 'load game' in real life."

"Maybe you get resurrected in this dimension," Pan Feng, who had been reading on the adjacent bunk, interjected. He tossed his book aside. "In the stories, people get hit by lightning or run over by a truck. So if you die over there, you should come back here, right?"

They all laughed, the tension in the room easing slightly. "Little Pan," Meng Xian said, "what did you sell?"

"Sanitary napkins."

The room erupted in laughter. "You're kidding!" Zha Wuchu exclaimed. "What woman would buy from you?"

"I sold to wholesalers," Pan Feng explained, taking a drag from a cigarette Ye Yuming had lit for him. "The FMCG industry is a meat grinder. More competition, more demands, but the pay never changes."

"So you think this is reliable?" Ye Yuming asked.

Pan Feng smiled. "Why wouldn't it be? Do you think [Director Wen][y002] is insane? He's poured his own money into this. To what end? To scam a few hundred people out of their savings?"

"So you really want to go?"

"Why not?" Pan Feng flicked his ash. "I'm one of the 'working poor.' I have a degree, I work hard, but what do I have to show for it? A life of saving for a down payment on a shoebox apartment, just to become a slave to the bank. People tell you to swim across the Pacific if you don't like it." He took another drag. "I'm a timid man. I've always followed the rules. But life is frustrating. So I came here. To take a chance."

A silence fell over the dormitory. His words had struck a chord. Ye Yuming lay back on his bunk, his mind already composing his report for the Internal Affairs Group.
