The original shop front had been redecorated in a modern style. Park Deok-hwan was initially unaccustomed to sitting high with his legs hanging down. As a government slave with no possessions, he had been sitting on the floor for many years. Although he had seen furniture like grand master's chairs and high tables, they were not commonly used. Even the Joseon royal family and the *yangban*, in private, mostly sat on the floor.

"Little Park," Feng Zongze said, settling into a grand master's chair, "you need to keep a close eye on the bow and arrow production recently! We're about to set up a foreign trade company. Bows and arrows are our island's flagship export product. As the supervisor, you must watch it for me and not let those merchants skim off the profits!"

"I understand, sir. I will be the Senate's limbs!" Park Deok-hwan immediately expressed his heartfelt devotion.

"Mmm." Feng Zongze had originally intended to talk to him about recent reports of him frequenting brothels and socializing too often with a group of merchants, and to warn him to be more careful. But just then, a messenger arrived to report that Zhu Mingxia had arrived.

"You need to be as meticulous as possible in your daily work, don't leave any room for others to exploit!" Feng Zongze reminded him. He still had a good impression of this young man: after all, he was one of the first local natives he had promoted. He was young, educated, and capable. And Park Deok-hwan's sycophancy was not bad either, though Feng Zongze himself hadn't noticed it.

He put on his hat and walked out. Park Deok-hwan quickly saw him off.

After seeing Feng Zongze off, he returned to his desk, feeling a little uneasy. He was now the "Supervisor of Bows and Arrows." Though it was called "bows and arrows," in reality, all the handicraft workshops in Jeju City were under his "control"—a new term invented by the Yuanlao, which he understood as "all under his management." In fact, it was more or less so. This included the allocation of raw materials for each workshop, production improvements, and product sales, all of which were subject to his supervision and statistics.

It was conceivable that this highly planned "Jeju Economic Combination," while effective for the Jeju Island forward command in controlling the island's handicraft and commercial activities, also opened the door to rent-seeking for the officials in charge. Recently, many people had been seeking his favor. He spent almost every night socializing in brothels, surrounded by flattering words and sycophantic smiles... Park Deok-hwan had never lived such a comfortable and happy life and couldn't help but feel a little carried away.

He never thought it was a big deal to eat and drink with the merchants, accept their hospitality, and take some silver. "A thousand li to be an official is only for wealth." Although the Joseon Dynasty didn't have this celestial dynasty proverb, it followed the same official code. The prevalence of corruption and bribery was no less than in the Ming Dynasty, and perhaps even more rampant.

As the son of a middle-class official in his youth, Park Deok-hwan had been exposed to such matters and needed no teaching. Naturally, he didn't feel much of a psychological burden. Especially since the "Chiefs" were busy with various affairs every day and couldn't pay attention to this area, it was essentially entrusted to him. Although he ate and drank a little, and got some benefits, he still managed everything in an orderly manner. Chief Feng had even praised him for being "capable" a few days ago.

But today, Feng Zongze's words had been like a bucket of cold water poured over him. Could someone be badmouthing him behind his back? He thought about it and suspected Kim Yong-ju.

Kim Yong-ju was also a government slave—Park Deok-hwan had once even considered marrying his daughter. Because he was from a hunter's family, he had been promoted to the position of military affairs clerk, specifically responsible for local security. Every day, he patrolled the city and its surroundings with a hundred or so local militiamen, and usually drilled them on the training grounds. These militiamen, dressed in uniform coarse cloth jackets and large hats, all wore red armbands with the characters "Public Security." They were neatly dressed and well-equipped, looking even more imposing than the former government soldiers when they marched on the streets.

Because Kim Yong-ju was from a hunter's family and had often eaten meat, he was unusually tall and strong for a Korean commoner of that time. When he led his team on the streets, he looked particularly majestic. For a time, even Park Deok-hwan, the top "collaborator of Jeju," felt a little intimidated by him.

Park Deok-hwan had always looked down on Kim Yong-ju. Not only was Kim Yong-ju a government slave, but he was also from the *baekjeong* class: the lowest class of commoners in the Joseon Dynasty, both crude and ignorant. But now that he was a military affairs clerk and had been assigned by Feng Zongze to frequently inspect the quality of the bows and arrows in the workshops, he tried his best to be perfunctory.

Although Kim Yong-ju had never said anything to his face, he always looked at him with suspicion whenever he came to inspect the bows and arrows. He had also heard that Kim Yong-ju had publicly called him a "traitor to his roots." Once, when he was going to a meeting, he overheard him in the corridor talking to another cadre about how "strange" his mansion was.

"This lowlife!" The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was highly likely that this person was making trouble for him with the Chiefs. He couldn't help but curse silently.

As the sky gradually darkened, the evening cannon sounded outside—a small cannon was fired at a fixed time every day at the gate of the Jeju Supervisory Camp to announce the time. Park Deok-hwan slung his satchel over his shoulder and left work directly.

His working hours were from six in the morning to six in the evening. At first, he had been very eager to please, not only arriving early and leaving late, but sometimes even sleeping in his office. Recently, his work enthusiasm had waned. The nightly socializing took up his time and exhausted his energy, and he gradually started arriving late and leaving early. Tonight was a night without any social engagements. He wanted to go home early and discuss his marriage with his brother.

Although Park Deok-hwan often lingered in brothels, he had always kept the matter of marriage in his heart. A prostitute was, after all, a low-class person. He was now an official of sorts and had to properly marry a woman from a good family to continue the Park family line.

There were many eligible young women in the city to consider, but since Park Deok-hwan had "become an official," his standards had changed. Although the former government slaves had been emancipated, he was still very particular and did not consider them. As for the daughters of the few former local officials on the island, to be honest, he didn't dare to provoke them—he was afraid of arousing the "Chiefs'" disapproval. Therefore, his target was the daughters of merchants and landlords.

A few merchants and workshop owners had hinted that they were willing to marry their daughters to him, but Park Deok-hwan either disliked the daughter's appearance or felt the family's wealth was insufficient and they probably couldn't provide a generous dowry. He had been picky until a few days ago when Hwang Wun-u hinted to him that Master Kim Man-il thought highly of him and intended to marry one of his illegitimate daughters to him. This made him overjoyed. This Master Kim was a top figure on Jeju Island, holding a second-rank official title! Even the Jeju magistrate and judge had to be polite to him. As for his wealth, it was countless. The cattle, horses, and sheep that roamed the mountains on his pastures alone were staggering.

Although she was only an illegitimate daughter, she was still Master Kim's flesh and blood. For her to be willing to marry him, a former government slave, made Park Deok-hwan feel so grateful and happy that he couldn't sleep all night.

He knew this was Master Kim's way of expressing his "goodwill" for what he had done recently. For this, he couldn't help but feel that he was very wise and had seized a great opportunity to climb onto Master Kim's high branch. He felt very proud every time he thought about it.

Park Deok-hwan returned to his mansion in high spirits. He had just sat down when his maid came to report that someone from Master Hwang Wun-u had arrived.

He went out and saw it was Choi Hyeon-taek. A few days ago, Choi Hyeon-taek had been sent by his boss, Hwang Wun-u, to the mainland to sell goods and had not been in Jeju.

Choi Hyeon-taek led several assistants, pulling carts loaded with tables, screens, cabinets, and many miscellaneous goods. These were all things not commonly seen here. Jeju Island was isolated overseas and had little handicraft industry. Furniture and daily necessities had to be imported from the peninsula, and fine goods were even rarer. These things looked like high-quality goods from the capital.

Choi Hyeon-taek said, "Our Master Hwang said that Master Park's happy event is approaching. There's nothing good to buy here on Jeju Island, so he specially asked me to bring these things for you from the capital."

Park Deok-hwan thanked him repeatedly. He had been worrying that the furnishings in his residence were too simple. He had money now, but he couldn't buy anything good in Jeju City. He was going to marry Master Kim's daughter and needed to make a good show of it. Master Hwang was indeed a thoughtful person. He also felt a little worried, feeling that he had become too involved with Hwang Wun-u and the others, and owed them too much.

Choi Hyeon-taek seemed to know what he was thinking and continued, "You are about to become Master Kim's cherished guest. His daughter has never lived a hard life. If your home is too rustic, your wife will not be happy when she marries into it. These things are no big deal. You can just pay for them. If you don't have enough money, our Master Hwang will lend it to you."

Seeing that he didn't say much, Choi Hyeon-taek instructed his assistants to quickly unload the carts and move the things.

In a short while, the once-empty rooms were filled with new furniture. A few scrolls of calligraphy and paintings were hung on the walls, and the room was instantly transformed. Park Deok-hwan stood in the room and looked around, a look of pleasure on his face.

Even his old home, as he remembered it before it fell into ruin, had never been this grand!

Choi Hyeon-taek sent his assistants back first and then brought in a young woman. She was about eighteen or nineteen, very beautiful, and clearly a northern woman. She wore a simple cloth dress. Although she kept her head down and didn't speak, her posture had an alluring charm that immediately caught Park Deok-hwan's eye.

Choi Hyeon-taek said with a grin, "Master Park is about to get married. Our master said: Master Park only has one maid at home, who can only do rough work like washing clothes and cooking. She probably won't be able to serve a lady from a *yangban* family. It just so happens that our master has a distant relative. Her name is Jang Seong-seol. She is of commoner status, and all her family members are gone. She has nowhere to go now, so let her stay by Master Park's side and serve you. It will be a home for her."

Park Deok-hwan quickly said, "I can't accept this! I can't! Master Hwang is too kind, I don't deserve it." This was an even greater favor, and he was about to marry Master Kim's daughter. Before his wife had even entered the door, what would it look like to have a beautiful maid by his side?
