Ye Yuming, having raised rabbits and poultry before, was assigned by Nanhai to manage the small animals. Since the number of rabbits was still small, they didn't build a dedicated hutch for the time being, only a three-story rabbit house in the courtyard. However, while taking care of the rabbits, he found that they were listless and not eating much. Could they be sick? He found a passage in the agricultural materials in the agricultural technology library: "Domestic rabbits have poor disease resistance. In a humid and unclean environment, they are prone to diseases and suffer great losses, especially young rabbits. Therefore, the management principle of dryness and cleanliness should be followed. When planning cages and the environment, attention should be paid to dryness and cleanliness, and sanitation and epidemic prevention management should be implemented. In addition, rabbits are more resistant to cold than heat. When the temperature exceeds 30°C, adult rabbits will reduce their food intake or stop eating. Does are prone to miscarriage, reduced milk production, or not feeding their kits, which can also cause disease outbreaks. Therefore, during the hot season, attention should be paid to heatstroke prevention and cooling."

Humid? Hot and stuffy? Rabbits? Then why did we bring rabbits to Hainan Island! And there was even a pair of Angora rabbits! There was no choice but to find a cool and ventilated place. Although this rabbit house was said to be under a fruit tree, the fruit tree was still a seedling. He had to move the rabbit cage out again and put it in an empty room, and from time to time, he would sprinkle water around to cool it down. [Wu Nanhai][y009] was not responsible for the rabbits' feed. Fortunately, he had raised rabbits before and had experience in gathering grass for them. After the vegetables were harvested, the vegetable scraps from the food service department could also be fed to the rabbits. By the way, when Nanhai's sweet potatoes were harvested, he could collect a large amount of sweet potato vines to feed the rabbits—don't look down on these guys who are listless now; once they cheered up, their reproductive ability was very amazing.

For the first few days, the work was basically cleaning the ground. The engineering team's bulldozer removed stones, tree roots, and weeds, and brought in a large amount of waste soil excavated from the project, deepening the soil layer. Such fields were still quite raw and could only be used to grow sweet potatoes. As for the hybrid rice, to be on the safe side, it was better to wait until next spring to plant it. He had to see how low the local winter temperature would drop. [Wu Nanhai][y009] also planned to plant some winter wheat and barley—barley likes a cool climate, can tolerate a certain degree of low temperature, and has a short maturation time, so it can be planted in the gap between the main crops.

Farming was extremely hard work: leveling the land, digging ditches, plowing, and applying base fertilizer. Although machinery could be used, there was still a lot of manual labor. A surprisingly large number of people applied to join the agricultural group. Many people regarded joining the agricultural group as their fantasy of a pastoral life. Not long after they started farming, some people complained of being tired or said that their major was not suitable, and they switched to other groups. [Wu Nanhai][y009] himself also felt that he couldn't take it. He felt that it was better for him to be an agricultural technician and give guidance. It was better to find farmers to do the work as soon as possible. The farmers assigned by Wu De, however, worked very hard.

After more than a month of breaking in, Wu De's labor team was already very efficient. He used five people who had conflicts with each other as team leaders and deliberately encouraged competition among them. This personal grudge between the leaders was more effective than any threat. Each team leader worked hard to drive his subordinates to work hard, for fear of falling behind his competitors.

Wu De also threw out material rewards at the right time. The team that completed its labor quota first each day would receive extra food. He also adopted a "last-place elimination" system. With every seven days as a cycle, the team with the lowest labor quota completion in seven days would have four people removed and assigned to the top four teams. If all the members of a team were transferred, the team leader would be demoted to a general laborer and all his privileges would be revoked.

Wu De's measure was to see how much skill these team leaders had in managing people. This measure would intensify the competition. A team leader who did not win the hearts of the people and manage them reasonably, but only relied on violent methods such as sticks and starvation to force the laborers to work hard, could only achieve his goal for a short time. It would not work in the long run. And the oppressed laborers also saw a way to counter the team leader—as long as they slacked off, for four consecutive seven-day periods, the high and mighty team leader would fall. The two sides had to reach a balance to cooperate effectively.

Obviously, Fu Youdi was extremely unsuited to this kind of competition. He was the first to become a captive team leader, and from that time on, he began to act tyrannically, not working himself, but only seeking his own benefits. Later, when the four people under him all became team leaders, he was extremely unbalanced. In order to maintain his "oldest team leader" face in front of Wu De, he intensified his oppression of his subordinates, even keeping a few thugs by withholding everyone's food, and established a tyrannical little kingdom. Almost every day, someone in his camp was beaten. The result was that he was increasingly hated in his own team, but he was completely unaware of it.

Wang Tian was more honest. Although he also took more benefits for himself, he did not oppress his subordinates. He took the lead in working hard. Everyone thought he was a good person, but some people inevitably slacked off. At first, Wang Tian was always weak and unwilling to manage them much. Later, when he found that his labor quota was slowly declining, he became anxious and started hitting people. When the quota went up, he repeated the cycle.

The other two were roughly at the level between Fu Youdi and Wang Tian. In contrast, Lin Xing's performance made Wu De look at him with new eyes. He divided his men into several small groups and assigned them to cooperate according to the different work content of each day. He also set an example by eating, living, and working with everyone. He never infringed on what others deserved. Even the reward food he received, he would share with his subordinates. But if someone was lazy, he would not let them off lightly. It was truly a case of clear rewards and punishments. The whole team was very obedient to him. Even the small landlords and rich peasants in the team in the past were very impressed with him. Some landlords even privately asked him to be the head of their long-term laborers in the future.

"There are indeed heroes among the masses," Wu De thought. Unlike modern people who could receive all kinds of information everywhere, where did an illiterate poor tenant farmer like Lin Xing learn this set of skills? Could it be that there were people with such leadership qualities born in this world?

Wu De also slowly improved the food treatment of the laborers. Now they could eat one dry meal and one thin meal every day. Of course, the dry rice was mixed with some local miscellaneous grains. But for the laborers, it was already quite good. Some team leaders continued to withhold food. He deliberately pretended not to know. As a result, the ordinary working masses became more and more dissatisfied with their team leaders and felt that the pirates were more conscientious.

After more than half a month of this, Fu Youdi's team was on the verge of collapse. After being at the bottom for two consecutive weeks and having eight people transferred, the exasperated Fu Youdi announced in the team that there would be no food for one day as a punishment. The laborers, who had long been oppressed by him, could no longer bear it. They swarmed him and beat him up. Even the few lackeys he had raised were not spared and were beaten black and blue.

The other teams were stunned by this sudden change. Wu De had a contingency plan for such a situation. He instructed the sentries at the captive camp not to enter the scene to quell the riot, but only to control the perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping in the chaos. He had planned to go in and clean up the situation after they had calmed down naturally, but he did not expect Lin Xing to spontaneously lead his men in to quell the riot.

When Fu Youdi's subordinates saw Wu De coming, they all knelt at his feet and vied with each other to accuse him of various crimes. Some of them he knew, and some were completely unexpected, which made him fully understand that no one could be God. Fu Youdi had actually been secretly hoarding the steel tools issued to the captives for work. The captives had long discovered that the tools issued by the "Chiefs" were much better than the simple iron farm tools they had used before. They were not only light and durable, but also remained in good condition with almost no need for sharpening. Fu Youdi had a plan—Lingao was very short of iron products. Iron farm tools and products were all transported from the mainland. These particularly easy-to-use tools should be able to sell for a good price. He found that although the tools were registered and inventoried when they were issued, because they had to work every day, it was impossible to go to get them every day and hand them in after work. They were usually piled up in a shed. So he secretly hid one every few days. Under the exposure of the masses, the bruised and swollen Fu Youdi had no choice but to take Wu De to the place where he hid the things and handed over the more than ten shovels, spades, and steel drills hidden in the grass by the river.

Looking at this pile of things, the transmigrators present were speechless. Were they really smarter than the so-called "natives"? At this moment, seeing a captive being able to steal things and hide them right under their noses, probably no one dared to say so.

It was unexpected that Fu Youdi, a person who was so timid and inarticulate two months ago, would end up like this. Seeing the captives' angry accusations one by one made Wu De even more convinced of this: human nature in the 17th century was no different from that in the 21st century.

However, the Fu Youdi incident exposed many problems that he had not thought of. None of the laborers came to expose Fu Youdi's problem. They were angry but did not dare to speak out. It was only when they could no longer bear it that they all broke out at once, resulting in a Chinese-style ending. It seemed that his captive management policy also had its shortcomings.

"I focused too much on internal conflicts," Wu De knocked his forehead in annoyance. He only wanted them to be disunited and unable to unite to resist. He did not expect that the prison bosses he had created would also strictly control their subordinates. Even the people he had planted inside who had expressed their willingness to join did not provide him with any incriminating materials because they were afraid. Fortunately, Fu Youdi was just a small money-grubber. Otherwise, if he had really hidden the tools and suddenly rioted, there would probably have been casualties. The mutual restraint between people was not realized at all.

In the final analysis, it was his starting point that was biased, Wu De reflected on himself. He was still following some old experiences. Although he was successful in managing personnel and brainwashing, the purpose of these practices was only to manage people to be well-behaved, not to cause trouble, and to work obediently. It was not enough to give full play to people's subjective initiative. What they needed were local allies. The future Transmigration Building would be built on these cornerstones. It was impossible to obtain the loyalty of these people by always using a method of surveillance, control, and exploitation.
