Such a person, even among the Transmigration members in the same courtyard, some did not know him, and some had never even known that such a person existed.

Zhao Manxiongski seemed to be very satisfied with his existence, as if he had entered a state of hibernation.

When Ma Jia went to find him and proposed that he become the director of the Political Security Bureau, Zhao Manxiong was reading a copy of "A Manual on Earthworks," with a gentle, worldly smile on his face.

After listening to Ma Jia's proposal for him to become the director of the Political Security Bureau, he raised a question:

"Is the General Political Security Bureau subordinate to the Tribunal?"

"That's right, it is indeed so in terms of establishment," Ma Jia said, deeply afraid that he would find this position not high enough. "However, the business is independent..."

"If I'm not mistaken, the structural refresh of the Executive Committee this time did not implement a system of separation of powers. Your position is equivalent to one of the Standing Committee members of the Political Bureau in charge of political and legal affairs."

"Yes."

"So, the General Political Security Department—no, it's the General Bureau now—is not directly under the Executive Committee?"

Ma Jia hesitated a little. In terms of subordination, this was indeed the case, but he had not yet figured out whether the Executive Committee intended to directly control this institution.

"In terms of subordination, that's the case," Ma Jia thought. Could it be that Zhao Manxiongski doesn't want to work under a political upstart like me? Is this guy ambitious?

"If that's the case, I'm willing to accept this position," Zhao Manxiong said without any coyness. "However, I have a few requests."

"No problem, please go ahead," Ma Jia said happily.

"I don't want to be the director of the General Political Security Bureau," Zhao Manxiongski said. "I have to attend meetings and report all day long. I'm not interested in that."

What does he mean by that? Ma Jia thought. He said, "You mean?"

"The director, you can appoint whomever you want, or perhaps you can take the position yourself. I just want to do the specific business work."

"I think I understand. Executive Deputy Director?"

"That's what I mean." Zhao Manxiongski nodded. "My time is very precious and cannot be spent on a large amount of administrative work."

"That's fine, I agree."

"My second request is that I really like the current environment," Zhao Manxiongski continued with his gentle smile. "Since the Internal Affairs Committee has been abolished under the new system, I hope this courtyard can be allocated for the exclusive use of the Security Bureau."

"I can't make the decision on this matter, but it shouldn't be a problem." Ma Jia thought that the original intention of the Executive Committee was not to have the powerful departments clustered together, so separating them was just right.

"Good. My third request is that I want personnel authority over the personnel of the General Political Security Bureau."

"You can," Ma Jia answered readily. "I will approve all the personnel transfer orders you issue."

And so the deal was done. After receiving Ma Jia's request, Xiao Zishan felt that the title of "Executive Deputy Director" lacked deterrent power. After thinking for a long time, he came up with the title of "General Political Commissar of the General Political Security Bureau" for Zhao Manxiongski. The General Political Commissar was not the director of the General Bureau, but it clearly expressed his responsible position. Ma Jia thought it was very good.

Unexpectedly, Zhao Manxiong firmly refused this title. He humbly stated that the title was too grand and not suitable for someone like him who had made no contribution to the Transmigration Group. He would rather have the title of "First Deputy Director of the General Political Security Bureau."

Later, when Ma Jia was reading a book by chance, he learned why Zhao Manxiongski did not like the imposing title of "General Political Commissar of the General Political Security Bureau." It turned out that Yagoda's last title before his arrest was "General Commissar of the State Security Committee."

The personnel bulletin was quickly issued. Zhao Manxiong was appointed as the "First Deputy Director of the General Political Security Bureau." As for who the director was, there was no appointment, and it was actually vacant.

In the tide of institutional adjustment and expansion, Wu Mu, a graduate of administrative management who had long been a "hatless" chief, finally obtained a formal position: he had been officially appointed as a staff member of the Social Work Department of the Civil Affairs Committee—his title was "researcher," which was actually just a gofer in the office.

The director and deputy director of the Social Work Department were Du Wen and Dong Weiwei. Generally speaking, it is difficult to work for a female leader, and it is even more difficult to work for a female leader like Du Wen.

Du Wen's work enthusiasm was extremely high. She started working at 6 a.m. every day and did not finish until midnight. She was used to going to the countryside during the day, so most of her work was done at night. Wu Mu often had to accompany her until very late, and every time she went to the countryside, the research materials of the Social Work Department would increase by a large amount, which made him complain endlessly.

After sorting out materials for Du Wen for more than ten days, Wu Mu suddenly found that life was even harder than when he had no position and was a "hatless" chief. In the past, he was often assigned to do some temporary clerical work. The work was not busy, and he could get off work at 5 p.m. on the dot. After returning, he would take a shower and have a meal. Although life was quite boring, at least he could go to bed on time at 9 p.m.

"Damn it, why did I come to this place?" Wu Mu slammed the documents in his hand on the table. "I quit!" With a casual toss, the documents scattered all over the floor.

Just as he was thinking about writing a resignation report, he suddenly heard footsteps behind him. Someone was coming! A chill ran up his spine. Could it be that Du Wen was back? No, she had gone to the Thirteen Villages this morning to work on grassroots political construction and would not be back until evening.

"Is Comrade Wu Mu here?" a voice sounded, right behind him.

He slowly turned around. A man was standing at the door, with his back to the light, so his face could not be seen clearly. He was wearing an ordinary navy training uniform, but this person was definitely not in the navy—he did not have the smell of the sea on him.

"It's me. What can I do for you?" Wu Mu asked warily. Since he had spoken at the general assembly, opposing Sun Li's views and supporting the three charges for executing an elder, he had provoked a group of people who insisted on the view that "the rights of the elders are paramount." Not only had some people criticized him fiercely, but it was said that these people also wanted to educate him with the "iron fist of the elders."

Wu Mu knew that Shan Liang, Sun Li, and their group had started with street politics, and they might not hesitate to use this against him. Wu Mu was well aware of the violent and easily incited nature of the masses, so he was always on guard. He had a pistol, but the nature of the internal contradictions among the people would change once firearms were used, so he carried a telescopic baton with him.

The visitor was a stranger, and he exuded an uncomfortable chill. Wu Mu's hand slowly rested on the telescopic baton in his trouser pocket.

"Of course, I have something to discuss. Oh, please take your hand off the baton. I have no ill intentions."

"What can I do for you?" Wu Mu released his hand, pulled out a chair, and sat down.

"You have a strong sense of vigilance," the visitor said with a hint of mockery. "This is the personal information form you filled out." He slowly took out a piece of paper and read:

"Wu Mu, 21 years old, height 175 cm, weight 75 kg, bachelor's degree in administrative management, military history enthusiast, with outdoor sports experience."

"That's right, this is my personal information." Wu Mu was surprised. Although the personal information of the Transmigration members was not top secret, very few people could see it.

"In your personal information, you said you are a militarist," the visitor sat down opposite him. He was a fat man. Wu Mu was sure he had never seen this person before.

"That's right."

"Then why didn't you serve in the army," the visitor asked, "and the job you intended to apply for was 'intelligence, counter-espionage, and other secret front' work—this has nothing to do with militarism."

"I support militarism and like the military, that's true, but I never said I wanted to be a soldier," Wu Mu said in a bad mood. "Who are you and what do you want?"

"Alright, let's be frank. You are a person who insists that the interests of the group are paramount, right?"

"Yes, that's my point of view."

"What if someone insists that his own interests are higher than the interests of the organization?"

"What on earth do you want?" Wu Mu suddenly became alert.

"Alertness is a good habit," the visitor nodded. "Would you like to come to the General Political Security Bureau?"

"Are you kidding?!"

"No kidding, comrade."

"I studied administrative management, which has nothing to do with this." Although Wu Mu was eager to show his skills on the secret front, he knew very little about it. He had read many books on this subject, but he knew very little about the business knowledge, and he couldn't help but feel timid.

"You can learn on the job."

"I'm very willing," Wu Mu made up his mind. "But I have a question."

"Please go ahead."

"What does the General Political Security Bureau protect?"

"Of course, it's the Transmigration Group and the entire cause."

"For all those who hinder the group and the great cause, should we distinguish between elders and natives?"

The visitor laughed, "Being too direct is not a good habit."

"Alright, I'm willing to go," Wu Mu nodded.

"Your qualifications are not enough to be the head of a business department, but I think the director of the office of the General Political Security Bureau is a good choice. I will be very happy to see you at the Internal Affairs Committee compound tomorrow at noon. It would be even better if you could bring some of your written views on the General Political Security Bureau."

While Wu Mu was still dizzy from his encounter, the visitor disappeared. Then he received a call from Xiao Zishan, asking him to "come over" to the general office in the afternoon.

That afternoon, he received a new appointment. Xiao Zishan handed the transfer order to him.

"Go and work hard for Zhao Manxiongski."

"Who is Zhao Manxiong?"

"He is your superior, the head of the General Political Security Bureau," Xiao Zishan asked strangely. "You don't know him? He specifically asked for you."

"So that fat man is him," Wu Mu suddenly realized. But he felt strange again. What outstanding qualities had he shown that made this newly appointed secret police chief take a fancy to him?
