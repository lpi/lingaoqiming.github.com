The rolling mill of the Ma Niao Steel Complex was large and, by the standards of this world, very modern. This was because its main equipment had almost all been unloaded from the ship and installed. However, by old-world standards, this rolling mill was a typical example of outdated production capacity that should be eliminated. According to several well-traveled Elders from the industrial sector, walking into it was like going back to a township steel mill of the 1990s. Even the supporting power equipment was steam-powered. Before the establishment of the large power grid in the 1980s and 1990s, all regions relied on their own urban power plants for electricity, which could not even fully guarantee civilian electricity consumption. Therefore, many small township steel mills at that time used steam engines as their power source. Shagang Group, China's most successful private steel enterprise, initially used a steam engine to drive its rolling mill.

Continuous casting and rolling were something the Elders in the metallurgy department dared not even dream of, so this rolling mill used steel ingots for processing and also forged wrought iron. In several huge wrought iron truss-style workshops were the main rolling equipment of the rolling mill: 2 blooming mills, 2 hot rolling mills, 2 hot piercing mills, 2 cold rolling mills, 2 cold drawing steel pipe machines, 2 cold drawing bar machines, and 2 cold rolling steel pipe machines. They could roughly cold roll and hot roll various common specifications of steel plates, strips, wires, and various types of section steel.

Although fully equipped, most of the equipment was not used frequently. Firstly, there were very few workers who could use this equipment, and even among the Elders, not many could, which meant it would take a considerable amount of time to train skilled workers. Secondly, the supporting equipment required by the rolling mill was very complex, and a series of supporting projects such as annealing and pickling seriously hindered the full-load operation of the equipment. Finally, both hot and cold rolling required lubricating oil and coolant. Although, to make do, the Lin'gao industry could currently supply substitutes for these things, except for cooling water, which could be supplied freely, other oil-based lubricants were subject to supply quotas. Therefore, much of the equipment was in a state of starting and stopping. The technical requirements for cold rolling were higher than for hot rolling, and the post-processing required a high level of technical skill. The yield of cold-rolled products from the rolling mill had always been low. This was also the reason why Ji Wusheng decided to only produce hot-rolled silicon steel sheets.

The process of hot-rolling silicon steel sheets was also complex, with a production cycle of 12-15 days. If producing silicon steel sheets for transformers, the time could be as long as 20 days. Therefore, a dedicated annealing furnace was required to avoid long-term occupation. The manufacturing and commissioning of this supporting equipment took the steel complex a long time.

During hot rolling, a single-heating rolling method was used. The silicon steel ingots were loaded into a heating furnace for preheating. The temperature of the heating furnace had to be maintained at 950°C-1020°C, which could roughly control the final rolling temperature above 700°C.

The heating furnace was a chain-type furnace, which had low thermal efficiency. The advantage was that the heating was uniform, which was more suitable for Lin'gao's industrial level. And the rolling of silicon steel sheets required very uniform heating. The loss of some thermal efficiency was an unavoidable choice.

First, the silicon steel ingots were rolled into slabs of a certain size by a rolling mill. They were first rolled into thin slabs by a cross-rolling mill, and then hot-rolled. This way, the slab tolerance could be controlled to a level of ±0.3mm, roughly meeting the tolerance control requirements.

After the slabs were rolled into shape, they were stacked into a certain number of blocks. Then the slabs were heated to the rated temperature in a heating furnace for formal hot rolling.

After hot rolling, the first step was natural stack cooling. However, this process was not conducive to decarburization, so the Elder technicians in the metallurgy department chose the rapid water cooling technology once used by the Shanghai Silicon Steel Plant. The hot-rolled silicon steel sheets were rapidly cooled in water within 10 seconds. This process not only reduced the natural cooling time but also greatly improved the decarburization level.

However, since immersion in water was equivalent to a quenching process, it would significantly increase the hardness of the steel sheets. This did not have a great impact on motor silicon steel, but it would affect the machining performance of transformer silicon steel with a higher silicon content, so it was only used in the production of motor silicon steel.

The cooled silicon steel sheets were then manually turned over for the first composition inspection to determine whether the elemental content was appropriate. Then they were hot-rolled and leveled again, and finally entered the annealing furnace for annealing.

Annealing was a key link in the decarburization of silicon steel sheets. The carbon content of the silicon steel sheets had to be reduced to 0.02% during the annealing process to be considered qualified. The Elders in the industrial sector unanimously agreed that the conditions in Lin'gao could be more lenient—in any case, it was better than low-carbon steel. The stacking method was still used for annealing. The annealing furnace at the Ma Niao rolling mill used coal gas as fuel for heating. Ideally, pure hydrogen could be used for heating and annealing, which would have the best decarburization effect. Ji Wusheng could only be satisfied with coal gas.

During annealing, the temperature was gradually increased at a rate of 15°C-30°C per hour to 690°C-750°C, then maintained for 11 hours, and then lowered at a rate of 10°C-15°C per hour until completely cooled.

The temperature control of the annealing furnace was very energy-consuming. The Lin'gao industry had no automatic temperature control equipment, and the temperature was controlled entirely by manually checking the thermometer and increasing or decreasing the gas flow of the heating nozzles. It was difficult to achieve precise temperature control in a small range.

After twenty days of continuous work, the first batch of motor silicon steel sheets was produced. Ji Wusheng immediately sent people to Ge Xinxin for spectrographic composition analysis.

The results of the composition analysis were barely satisfactory. By old-world standards, the silicon steel sheets produced by the metallurgy department after several months of hard work and a large amount of manpower and material resources were scrap. Then, a magnetic test was conducted. The results were even more disastrous. The test results of the part with the best magnetic properties were also unsatisfactory. The Elders in the power sector who had been eagerly awaiting the silicon steel sheets felt as if they had been doused with cold water and were holding ice in their arms. Most of the silicon steel sheets produced with great effort could not even be graded according to the national standard. About 10% barely qualified as low-grade silicon steel. The most tragic thing was that about 20% of the finished products had mechanical performance problems and were unusable scrap.

This was the first such failed trial production in the industrial history of Lin'gao. However, the Elders in the metallurgy department knew that they couldn't force it. To further improve the quality, they could only wait for the overall industrial level to rise to another level and then slowly explore and improve.

"What's the point of having a motor industry with this?" Qian Liushi said with a愁眉苦脸 look on his face when he saw the test report.

Faraday was not so pessimistic. "I think it's not so bad. Anyway, having something is better than having nothing, that's the first point. Second, the worst of it is still better than low-carbon steel, isn't it?"

"That's true, but with this kind of performance, is it still possible for you to copy existing motor designs?" Qian Liushi said. "I think it's very doubtful."

"Although these silicon steel sheets are not the silicon steel sheets we hoped for, they are not low-carbon steel," Faraday said. "Of course, they are only slightly better than steel sheets. But it's a hope. You have to have a baby before you can have an adult, right? From low-carbon steel to silicon steel, that's a qualitative leap. We can only try to adapt to the existing conditions first."

"That's the only way. It's just that the motor will probably have to be redesigned," Qian Liushi said. "The silicon steel sheets are what they are. We can't have too many complex hopes. How do you plan to solve the problem of the permanent magnets for the permanent magnet motors?"

"I've checked the data. The Shilu iron ore is 42% pure magnetite, which is a very good raw material for sintering magnetite. We can use this to make permanent magnets first. The efficiency will certainly be a bit poor, but since we're going to use these ungraded silicon steel sheets, this is nothing."

"The Shilu iron mine hasn't been developed yet. And I hear that transportation is difficult, so the Planning Department didn't put it on the first five-year plan."

Although more than one Elder had suggested advancing the development of Shilu into the first five-year plan since the stable supply of Southeast Asian slaves began, and some Elders had brought it up again after Operation Engine, the Planning Department had always vetoed it.

The main difficulty in developing the Shilu iron mine was not mining, but the transportation of the iron ore. The Shilu iron mine was located in the mountains. Not only was it not near the sea like Tiandu, but it was also surrounded by rugged mountains. A railway had to be built for large-scale transportation. The Japanese had built the Basuo line by sacrificing lives.

If sacrificing lives alone could build the railway from Shilu to Basuo or from Shilu to Tiandu, the Planning Department would not have hesitated. But the huge consumption of materials for building the railway made Wu De flinch, not to mention some engineering difficulties, such as how to construct tunnels. And Basuo was not a natural good harbor; it had to be artificially improved before ore carriers could use it.

For now, the Planning Department could only be satisfied with first building a simple road from Changhua to Shilu to establish basic transportation between the two places and ensure the Yuanlao Yuan's influence in this area.

"That's true," Qian Liushi thought for a moment. "But magnetite is not a rare thing. It's not hard to find if you look carefully. If all else fails, we can take a company, have people carry it on their backs and horses, and go to Shilu via the land route from Changhua to transport a dozen tons out for now. This shouldn't require a large investment or a project, right?"

The report on the silicon steel project also reached the office of the manufacturing director at the first opportunity. The machinery sector was not as picky as the power sector. In [Zhan Wuya][y004]'s view, the priority now was to solve the problem of whether they had it or not, and then discuss whether it was good or not. He now urgently needed to expand the power supply to supply the non-ferrous metal smelting industry. In addition to providing electrolytic copper, he also hoped to obtain non-ferrous metals such as nickel and cobalt to smelt stainless steel. The chemical sector had been demanding stainless steel for a long time. A large number of corrosion-resistant pipes and containers in chemical equipment needed to be made of stainless steel. If they continued to be at the level of manufacturing ceramic or glass equipment, the chemical industry in Lin'gao would essentially be just a scaled-up laboratory production, unable to complete the self-replication of the chemical industry, let alone upgrade it.

Therefore, as soon as the trial production of silicon steel sheets was successful, he immediately reported to the Planning Department, requesting the formal launch of the electrolytic copper workshop project.
