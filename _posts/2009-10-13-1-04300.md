"Old Wen, I have the ship!" [Wang Luobin][y003] burst into the office, his face flushed with triumph. He brandished a folder like a trophy. "Permits, licenses... all of it. Money truly does make the world go 'round."

"The ship, or the licenses?" [Wen Desi][y002] and [Xiao Zishan][y001] exchanged a look of confusion.

"Both! Meng De and I have been all over the country. This is the one. I guarantee you'll be satisfied."

This ship, their *Mayflower*, destined to birth a new world, would one day be enshrined as the "Holy Ship," a monument to their audacity. For now, it was just a forty-year-old general cargo ship, a rusting relic nearing the end of its service life.

It was a Polish-designed vessel, built in a domestic shipyard in the late 1970s. Its registered tonnage was just under 7,000 tons, with a cargo capacity of 6,000. It had five holds, four derricks, and a cruising speed of eleven knots. It was a versatile workhorse, capable of carrying dry goods, refrigerated cargo, and even containers. But its size and deep draft made it uneconomical for coastal transport, and it had been laid up for years.

"She's a bit rough around the edges," [Wang Luobin][y003] admitted. "But she was in preservation. The equipment is old, but it's all functional."

"How much?" [Wen Desi][y002] asked, his voice tight. A ship like this could cost tens of millions.

"Twelve million."

A wave of relief washed over him. It was well under their thirty-million-dollar budget.

"We should spend a few million on repairs, though. Get everything in working order. We won't be able to fix it once we're over there."

"Do it," [Wen Desi][y002] said, gritting his teeth. The money was meant to be spent.

"With the surplus," [Wang Luobin][y003] continued, "Meng De suggested we buy two more ships."

"What?"

"A 1,500-ton self-propelled deck barge for 3.5 million. And," he paused for dramatic effect, "a landing craft. Just decommissioned from the military. The machine gun mounts are still intact."

"A landing craft?" [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s eyes widened.

"And it's cheap! 160,000! A steal, according to Wu De."

"And the fishing boats?"

"A Type 8154 single-trawler, 200 tons. Also decommissioned. 1.2 million per boat. He wants four."

"Buy them all," [Wen Desi][y002] said, his voice strained. "As long as it's within the budget." He felt a familiar sense of dread. Their finances were a house of cards, a labyrinth of shell companies and creative accounting managed by a young man named Cheng Dong, whose daily lamentations about their precarious financial situation were a source of constant anxiety. Their reserves were dwindling, and their last batch of Ming Dynasty goods—rare medicinal herbs, hardwoods, and spices—was proving difficult to sell without attracting unwanted attention.

*Just get us to the 15th of the eighth lunar month,* he thought, gazing at the waxing moon.

In a tiered lecture hall, the air was thick with the hum of dozens of laptops and the scent of stale sweat. The blackout curtains were drawn, casting the room in a dim, mysterious light. On the stage, a massive projection screen displayed a photo of a scantily clad woman. Below it, in bold characters, were the words: "Sola Aoi," followed by a string of alphanumeric code.

"Attention," a voice boomed from the stage. "Standard number P01701105-3, name: Sola Aoi. Begin resource synchronization."

A server on the stage hummed to life, issuing commands to the laptops through a wireless network. An intelligent search began, scouring the hard drives for all video files associated with the name "Sola Aoi." It compared file sizes and formats, generating a report that identified duplicates and superior-quality versions. Then, the culling began.

"My Sola Aoi collection!" someone screamed, frantically mashing their keyboard. "It took me a month to download that!"

"Don't touch your keyboards!" the man on the stage shouted into a microphone. "The server has DVD-rip MKVs. Your low-res files are obsolete! You can download the high-quality versions later and fap yourself to death!"

A wave of laughter and sighs swept through the room. The next name appeared on the screen.

This was "resource standardization," a massive undertaking to catalogue, de-duplicate, and back up the terabytes of digital information the transmigrators had brought with them. It was a digital ark, a repository of knowledge and entertainment from the world they were leaving behind. Academic journals, engineering manuals, movies, television shows, and, of course, a vast and meticulously curated collection of Japanese pornography. All of it was being indexed and stored on a central server, a library for their new civilization.

Personal laptops were left untouched, but all external hard drives and discs were collected for centralized management. The Information Group had the authority to delete and reorganize the data for optimal storage. Once the process was complete, everyone would be able to download materials of personal interest from the central server, though the most critical resources would require authorization. It was a digital commons, a shared inheritance for a new world.
