"They won't take our lives, will they?"

"Oh, my mother must be worried sick." Ma Peng began to wipe his tears.

Fu Buer felt a bit upset. You have a mother, but I have a whole family! My wife is one thing, but he couldn't bear to part with the few concubines he had taken, especially the third one who was from Guangzhou. Although she was a bit older, she was originally from a brothel [Note: a high-class brothel, what was then called a "xingyuan." The "older" here is according to the standards of the Ming Dynasty, where a woman of twenty-seven or twenty-eight was considered to be past her prime]. She was fashionably dressed, could sing little tunes, and was much better than the local country girls. She had completely captivated Master Fu.

He also thought that his son was young and his daughter couldn't support the family. If he couldn't go back, wouldn't the family property he had accumulated be embezzled by his uncles and cousins of the same clan? He had been envied by his clansmen for more than a day or two. The more he thought about it, the more he regretted it. Seeing that the surroundings were not tightly guarded, and there were only two young pirates watching, he fumbled around on his body and found some scattered silver, totaling two taels. Fearing that it was not enough, he also took off his gilded silver net scarf ring—this was probably worth two or three qian. After looking at it for a long time, he thought that more than two taels of silver to buy one person's escape was probably enough. The appetite of these small fries would not be too big.

Fu Buer mustered up his courage and tremblingly approached the young pirate holding a matchlock. He offered the silver. He could speak some Guangzhou dialect, but it was clear that the young man couldn't understand. He had to point to himself, then to the outside, and make a running motion.

But the young man showed no expression and gestured at him with the matchlock with a sword attached, which scared Fu Buer into silence. But he didn't dare to withdraw his hand with the silver—forget it, it wouldn't be his after a search anyway, so it was better to exchange it for some care. But the young man did not take his money, but only motioned for him to take it back, then pointed to his injured leg and to the large tent on the side. Fu Buer knew that he was being told to wait here for treatment.

It was not until evening that the medical team finished treating all the wounded. Fu Buer's leg was stitched with more than ten stitches—for the doctor, this person was very lucky. The bullet had penetrated the muscle without staying in his body or breaking any bones or blood vessels. But for Fu Buer, it was a completely new experience. It was the first time he knew that flesh and blood could be sewn up like a tailor sewing clothes, although he screamed his head off during the suturing.

Two-thirds of the more than thirty seriously wounded had died while waiting. As for the rest, the doctors took a look and felt that there was little hope of saving them: there was no plasma, a lack of qualified nurses, and it would be difficult for these people to survive on the operating table.

"Let the military team give them a quick end." He Ma knew that in the current situation where resources were extremely precious, it was unlikely that the limited medical resources would be used to treat these people.

Shi Niaoren pondered for a moment and said, "Forget it, let's treat a dead horse as a living one. They have been able to hold on from noon until now, their vitality is strong enough. Let's give it a try."

"But there's no plasma, we have to find people to donate blood. We need to test the blood..."

"Just use saline," Shi Niaoren made up his mind. "No need for anesthesia either. Whether they can survive depends on their luck."

"This... this..." The people in the medical team were all stunned. Without anesthesia, without plasma, to operate on these seriously wounded, bleeding, and some already unconscious people, wasn't that tantamount to murder?

"Didn't I say it? Treat a dead horse as a living one. Whether they can live depends on their fate." Shi Niaoren had another sentence that he didn't say: it was better to let them die on the operating table than to watch them die, which would make his heart feel a little better. He had another sentence that he couldn't say: let everyone practice surgery by the way.

"Come on, let's get to it." With his call, the medical team, which had been busy for most of the day, started to get busy again. However, there were not enough medical staff, especially nurses, so they had to let the doctors help the doctors. In the end, even the veterinarian, Dr. Yang, was called over. He had just finished treating the three captured horses and had also treated their horse diseases by the way.

"Old Yang, can you operate on people?"

"I can operate on horses..." Yang Baogui joked. "Just give me the work of debridement, disinfection, and suturing of wounds. It's all about the same. By the way, I can also do amputations."

"Let's get to it."

At the post-war review meeting held in the evening, based on the actual situation exposed in the battle, five main problems were sorted out:

1. Insufficient military training and poor fighting will. Most people were not only unskilled in handling firearms, but also had too many ineffective shots. They could not hold on when there was a slight danger, and even fled in disarray when resisting from behind fortifications. If it happened in the wild, it was hard to say what would happen.

2. Extremely poor organization. Except for the members of the military group who could still effectively follow the command of the group leaders to fight, the military group could hardly command the temporarily organized masses. "A motley crew," He Ming said at the summary meeting.

3. In terms of protection, the equipment of steel helmets + anti-stab vests proved to be effective. But the problem exposed in this battle was that the protection area was too small, and the limbs and face lacked protection. Further protective products need to be developed.

4. The strategy was too cautious, limiting themselves to Bairen Tan and not taking the initiative to attack by taking advantage of their superiority in firepower, communication, and mobility, resulting in a passive and beaten situation.

5. The defense of Bairen City was obviously insufficient and needed to be strengthened.

But the focus of the meeting was the next strategic policy.

The moderates still insisted on taking the two points and one line as the main activity center, strengthening the defense of the base, and after creating a fait accompli, taking industrial and technological development as the core, forming a complete urban and industrial and agricultural system, and using rich materials, superior life, and advanced technology to form a "beacon effect" to attract local people to join the circulation and construction, and finally achieve the goal of "peaceful evolution."

The radicals, on the other hand, ridiculed the moderates as a true "turtle school." They were clearly three centuries stronger than the other side, but they were as timid as a tiger, only shrinking behind trenches and barbed wire, not daring to fight for the initiative. They reminded the other side that if they did not take the initiative to attack and destroy the local Ming Dynasty ruling center, the resources of Lingao would never be used by them, and this ruling center would organize all kinds of hostile activities again and again.

"Lingao County can launch such a two-pronged attack today, and maybe tomorrow they will send people to launch a sneak attack. They have done it before. And in the future, we will definitely leave the base and go further and further to collect various materials. Will we rely on the military group to escort us every time?"

The radicals listed the various benefits of occupying the county town: first, a large number of people in the county town could be captured as labor; second, taxes and grain could be collected through the captured tax and corvee registers, and a large amount of materials, money, and grain in the county treasury could also be obtained...

These benefits made many people's hearts flutter. Although the moderates used historical materials and reality as weapons: telling them that there were not many residents in the city who could be captured as coolies, and from the Ming Dynasty's Lingao County Annals, this county had never been very rich, and there would not be much material and grain in the county treasury.

At this time, the representative of the radicals, [Ma Qianzhu][y005], unexpectedly proposed to temporarily shelve this issue and focus on solving the problems of training and organization exposed in this battle.

The training work was indeed a blank: they had been working every day for more than ten days since they came ashore, and there was no time at all. They had only done live-fire target practice once, and each person fired five bullets, which made the Planning Committee's heart ache. Five hundred people would need two thousand five hundred bullets. The biggest loss for the transmigrators in this battle was their ammunition consumption. In this battle that lasted less than an hour, they consumed nearly three thousand rounds of ammunition, which was a considerable number. And the total ammunition stock was only one million rounds... This kind of training and small battle used up so much ammunition, how would they fight the next battle? When would they be able to produce metal-cased cartridges?

As for the problem of organization, it was obviously directly related to the lack of military training. [Xiao Zishan][y001] proposed at the meeting: the various professional groups performed well in the battle, which was obviously the result of working together and being familiar with each other. The problem mainly came from the various so-called "basic labor groups" that were temporarily formed every day. This kind of group was a fixed establishment at the beginning, but the actual situation was that it was temporarily formed every day according to the deployment of the human resources department. As a result, everyone was not familiar with each other and lacked a sense of trust. It was fine to work at ordinary times, but it was difficult to unite in a critical situation.

After discussion, the Executive Committee reaffirmed the group plan: all transmigrators, except for family units, would form fixed four-person groups on the premise of free combination. Each group would elect a group leader to be responsible, participate in labor together, and their housing would be arranged in the same dormitory as much as possible. Friendship would be enhanced through eating, living, and working together—the relationship between dormitory brothers in college was relatively strong.

Each group was issued an SKS rifle as group equipment, so that everyone would have the opportunity to practice with the rifle at ordinary times. This would not only avoid the situation where everyone was not familiar with the weapons when they were issued only in wartime, but also prevent the situation where everyone had a rifle, resulting in the loss of control of firearms.

With these groups as the basic unit, a certain amount of time would be set aside each week for military training to enhance mutual coordination. Immediately after, Bei Wei threw out a new training plan: "Hunting."

"Each time, our military group will dispatch 5 people, and then bring 2-3 ordinary groups," he explained the plan in detail. "We will break away from our current mode of only acting along the Wenlan River, and conduct reconnaissance in depth in all directions, correct the map, and investigate various resources—"

When the group was on the move, they would capture single or small groups of pedestrians, and if necessary, attack various local armed personnel to train the team through combat. By training while on the move, it would be closer to actual combat than marching in formation and practicing target shooting at the base. The authority of the transmigrators would be spread to every corner of the county, so that the common people would know of their arrival and spread the necessary terror.

This plan obviously had a bloody smell, but the moderates decided not to oppose it. After all, the reality of twenty-one people being injured was there. If they were to veto this plan, the radicals would inevitably re-propose the proposal to attack Lingao County. With the current sentiment, the moderates did not think they would win in a vote. In the end, the moderates agreed to this "hunting" plan as a compromise for the radicals not to propose occupying the county town again.
