There were still tens of thousands of jin of grain in storage in Chengmai County. Now, the government army had sealed the county granaries for military use and ordered the wealthy households to "contribute" grain. Song Zonghui, being the richest man in the county, was of course a prime target. Not only was he forced to contribute one hundred *shi* of grain, but he also "happily donated" five hundred taels of silver, much to his distress. The discipline of visiting troops was often poor. Despite the generals' efforts to maintain order, incidents of extortion from shops and wealthy households, and even assault and robbery, still occurred in the city. If it weren't for Zhao Ruyi and his aides staying at his house, this richest man of Chengmai would have long since become a juicy piece of meat for the officers.

"The rebels at Shishan are isolated behind enemy lines. They will naturally retreat when their grain runs out. Once the supply line is open, what's there to worry about for military provisions! You all are just worrying for nothing!" Lu Yizhong said, eating half a pastry. "You are the deputy commander of the county militia. As long as you do your duty well, you will surely be recommended for a reward." He flicked the pastry crumbs from his sleeve. He Rubin had suffered several defeats, but Lu Yizhong remained calm. He felt that these were just temporary setbacks caused by underestimating the enemy at the beginning. In every meeting, Lu Yizhong's argument was a simple "stalemate"â€”a war of attrition. With the resources of the entire Guangdong province, they could wear down the rebels in Lin Gao, even if it was just a matter of time.

"Yes, yes," Song Zonghui said, still looking worried. With the title of "richest man," all sorts of costly tasks always fell on him. If he hadn't obtained the title of *jiansheng* a few years ago, his small fortune would have long since been exhausted by the government.

Gou Chengxuan sat at Qian Taichong's table without a word. He had a low status and no official position as an aide, so few people paid him any attention. He was a very calculating person and knew that this group of people did not think much of him. He had also fled from the rebels. If the war went well, it would be one thing, but if it went badly, he might be beheaded as a "spy." So he had maintained a policy of speaking as little as possible. Among the aides, only Qian Taichong, with his idea of "pacifying" Lin Gao, would occasionally discuss the geography and local customs of Lin Gao with him. Otherwise, it was as if he didn't exist.

His mood was very low. Gou Chengxuan had originally held out hope for the government's expedition. He had thought that the rebels had few soldiers and that the people of Lin Gao would not dare to fight for them once the government army arrived. The weak rebels would likely be forced to retreat. He even had a grand plan: as soon as the government army arrived in Lin Gao, he would rally the gentry and form a militia to help the army. He even planned to humbly request Huang Shoutong to be the militia commander and Liu Dalin to be the head of the "Pacification Bureau." Gou Chengxuan felt that by acting as a "deputy," he could not only gain some real power but also lay a good foundation for re-establishing his authority in Lin Gao in the future.

But after the government army had clashed head-on with the rebels in Chengmai several times, Gou Chengxuan knew that the best outcome of this war would be a stalemate. It was probably impossible to attack Lin Gao and force the rebels to retreat. He was very worried and also concerned about Lai Da. He was afraid that Lai Da, upon returning to Lin Gao, would find his father and Uncle Hu, raise a banner to support the government army, and end up being killed when the government army failed to arrive.

At this moment, he was drinking tea in silence, wondering what he should do after this expedition against the rebels failed. He couldn't rely on General He. He had never been taken seriously in the first place, and if the army was defeated, he would be finished once the court investigated. It was impossible to expect General He to help him take revenge and restore his family's fortune...

Suddenly, a "boom" sounded from outside, the sound very clear. The cannon shot was muffled, not the sound of the rebels' cannons, but the sound of the government army's Hongyi cannons.

Then, two more shots followed. Everyone heard it clearly this time. The sound of the cannons seemed to be coming from the south gate. The aides were stunned and pricked up their ears.

"What's happening?" Everyone was surprised. For the past few days, neither the rebels nor the government army had been fighting, and no cannons had been fired. It was now close to the end of the *hai* hour, a time of deep night and silence, and the moon was dim. Could it be that the rebels were raiding the camp? Everyone tensed up.

"Boom! Boom, boom!" A few more muffled sounds came. This time, it was clear that besides the cannons on the city gate, the camps outside the city were also firing.

"It's cannon fire! They're firing!" Qian Taichong was the first to stand up, waving his arms and shouting.

The others remained seated. "Is it cannon fire?" "Are you sure?" "Could it be... could it be the rebels raiding the camp?!" Finally, they could no longer maintain their composure and stood up with a "whoosh."

"Yes, it's cannon fire!"

"Quick, send someone to see!"

A servant was sent to inquire. Everyone was worried. A sudden rebel raid on the camp was too strange! There were still nearly twenty thousand government soldiers in and around Chengmai, while the rebels, even if they combined their forces, had no more than ten thousand. Could they have suddenly received reinforcements? They couldn't help but feel uneasy.

"No matter, our defenses are strong, and the city and camps are impregnable. If the rebels come to raid the camp, they will only be met with a bloody nose..." Lu Yizhong had just said this when a sharp "bang" sounded from outside, followed by a whistling sound. In an instant, there was another loud explosion.

"The rebels are firing!" half a dozen mouths shouted at once. This was the sound of the cannons they had become familiar with over the past few days. And the subsequent loud explosion was the sound of the rebels' exploding shells. Everyone tensed up.

Lu Yizhong's face turned a little pale. He tried to remain calm and said, "The rebels are firing... haha... haha..."

Outside, the rumbling of cannons continued, one after another. Now, no one could sit still. Qian Taichong waved his hand. "Let's go, let's go see!" With that, he strode out. The others followed in a swarm, leaving the garden and going to the main courtyard of the Song residence.

It was now close to midnight. The moon was hidden behind floating clouds, appearing and disappearing. A vast, continuous expanse of clouds was tinged with a strange silver edge, but this sight did not attract anyone's attention. What occupied everyone's mind was the sound from outside the courtyard walls, which had become clearer. Besides the continuous sound of cannons, there were also the chaotic sounds of people shouting, dogs barking, and a general uproar from the streets.

They could hear tense shouts from all over the street, the clash of armor and weapons, and the sounds of cursing and crying. In the distance, a horn sounded, its long, mournful blast echoing.

The servant who had been sent to inquire ran back in a panic.

"What on earth is happening?" Song Zonghui asked in a panic.

"Reporting to the master, it's chaotic outside. They say... they say the rebels have brought in giant cannons and are about to bombard the government camp!"

"What?"

"Oh, oh, and some are saying: the rebels from Shishan have attacked from the other side and are going to pincer the government army in Chengmai!"

Both pieces of news were plausible. While everyone was in a state of alarm, Lu Yizhong expressed his disbelief:

"What giant cannons? If they had giant cannons, the rebels would have brought them earlier. Why wait until today? It's the middle of the night. Even if they had giant cannons, are the rebels all equipped with night vision, able to see in the dark?"

"Yes, it must be the rebels harassing us at night!" someone chimed in.

"Ai, let's go out and see for ourselves!" Qian Taichong was not content to sit and speculate. Without waiting for anyone's agreement, he led his servant out.

The streets were indeed in an uproar. In the darkness, they could see soldiers, militia, and laborers running with swords, spears, lanterns, and torches. The city wall was brightly lit. Groups of soldiers guarding the Song residence were gathered together, whispering among themselves and craning their necks to look in the direction of the cannon fire. And the booming of cannons and the explosions of exploding shells continued to come from the distance, sometimes loud, sometimes soft...

They stopped a captain and learned that many bright lights had appeared on the sea, seemingly rebel naval reinforcements. The cannon fire they had heard was from the government cannons at Xiaoyingchang, intercepting the rebel ships.

"What? The rebels are trying to take Xiaoyingchang?"

"I don't know, sir, but that's what everyone is saying." The captain said and hurried off with his men.

Qian Taichong suggested they go up to the city gate tower to see, as they couldn't see anything clearly from the street. Some were afraid of being hit by rebel cannon fire and didn't dare to agree, but others were willing to go. In the end, half of them went.

They were all military aides, and the captain guarding the city gate tower recognized Qian Taichong and the others and let them up. They looked out from the tower. The outside was dark and there was nothing unusual, but there were many lights on the sea, as if many ships had arrived. From time to time, they could see a flash of fire, followed by a muffled cannon shot. There were also flashes of fire from Xiaoyingchang, as if the two sides were engaged in an artillery duel.

"The rebels are sailing at night..." Before Chang Qingyun could finish, someone cried out in alarm. Everyone looked in the direction of the sound. A bright light had risen into the sky from the sea, like a fireball flying through the air.

"A comet!" someone shouted.

But they soon realized it was not a comet. The bright spot was moving slowly, and its altitude was constantly decreasing, as if it were heading towards the county town. Everyone was terrified and didn't know what to do. They watched as the ball of fire flew over the city gate tower and crashed outside the city, followed by a violent explosion and a shower of sparks.

"What the hell is that?!" Chang Qingyun cried out.

At this time, more and more points of light rose from the sea, flying in a dense swarm towards Xiaoyingchang and the nearby government camps.

"The enemy is firing rockets!" Chang Qingyun had read many books on firearms and immediately understood. The rebels were firing rockets. Apart from books, he had never seen a real rocket launch. Seeing the increasingly dense fire in the sky, like a rain of fire, he was stunned.

Rockets, trailing orange flames, were constantly being launched from the sea, falling in rows and groups on Xiaoyingchang, like a huge rain of fire. The camp, which had only a few lights before, was now filled with huge flashes of fire and explosions. Balls of fire rose into the dark night sky from time to time, and some areas were clearly already on fire.

Suddenly, a huge flame erupted from the direction of Xiaoyingchang, followed by a muffled explosion like rolling thunder. Everyone's heart skipped a beat. They knew it was most likely the powder magazine in the government camp that had exploded.

With the explosion of the powder magazine, the fire at Xiaoyingchang grew larger, illuminating the entire seaside. And the rebels' rockets continued to fall into the camp, adding to the chaos. Qian Taichong cried out, "Xiaoyingchang is about to fall!"

Indeed, a large group of people rushed out from the direction of Xiaoyingchang. Under the reflection of the fire, it was clear that they were the government soldiers guarding Xiaoyingchang, now fleeing in a panic towards the main camp.

"The rebels are trying to cut off our sea supply line!" Qian Taichong cried out in alarm. Although he didn't think that transporting grain by sea was a good idea, the rebels' sudden attack on Xiaoyingchang made their objective clear.

"What... what should we do?" Someone was holding onto the battlement, stamping his feet in anxiety.

"It depends on..."

Chang Qingyun's words were cut short. Flames also erupted from the direction of the rebel main camp. A dozen or so points of light were streaking through the sky towards the county town and the main camp.

"Rockets!" the soldiers on the city wall cried out in alarm, hiding behind the battlements. A rain of fire instantly fell on the camps outside the city.

Qian Taichong shouted, "Everyone, take cover!" He himself ducked behind a battlement. Others scrambled and crawled into the city gate tower, or ran down the horse ramp, trying to get off the wall. It was dark and they were in a panic. The aides were all wearing the loose-sleeved robes of scholars. In the chaos, some had their robes stepped on, their sleeves pulled, and they fell and were trampled, crying out in distress.

"What a disgrace to the scholarly class!" Qian Taichong watched as some of his companions fell, their hair disheveled. Some were so intent on fleeing that they had lost their shoes. Others, in their panic, had missed their footing and tumbled down the horse ramp...

The first wave of rockets hissed as they rained down on the government camps. The camps were immediately thrown into chaos. Water gongs were beaten wildly, and people were shouting everywhere, "Fire! Fire!"

Qian Taichong peeked out from between the battlements. He saw that fires had broken out everywhere in the camps, and it was a scene of utter chaos. As he watched in horror, he heard the sound of more rockets streaking through the air. This time, countless rockets were being launched from the rebel main camp, and many more were being fired from the rebel ships on the sea.

For a time, rockets fell like rain, and the entire camp was plunged into chaos. The soldiers could no longer be bothered with firefighting and scrambled for cover. The more Qian Taichong watched, the more frightened he became. The rebels' rockets seemed to be endless, like ordinary arrows, fired in a continuous stream. In the camps, it was impossible to even gather men to prepare for battle, let alone find a place to hide.

The rebels' rockets seemed to be deliberately avoiding the county town, but many stray shots still hit the city walls. Some hit the watchtowers, others hit the city gate tower, and many flew over the walls and landed in the residential areas, causing fires. The city was also in a panic, with water gongs being beaten everywhere to put out the fires.

Fortunately, the rebels did not seem to be targeting the county town, but were concentrating their fire on the government camps below the city. Many camps were on fire, and it was a scene of chaos everywhere.

Qian Taichong saw clearly that although the rockets came in wave after wave, they seemed to be of different sizes and had different effects upon landing. Some just scattered sparks, setting things on fire, while others exploded with a loud bang. He secretly wondered if there were two types of warheads. He also thought about the fact that the sea was a good ten *li* from the county town, yet the rebels' rockets could still reach it. The thought sent a chill down his spine. If that was the case, wouldn't the rebels' rockets be a powerful weapon for attacking cities and camps!

Suddenly, a figure stumbled and crawled to his side. He looked closely and saw that it was Chang Qingyun.

Chang Qingyun's voice was tinged with tears. He said, "It's... it's over! Our army is defeated! It's all over this time!"

The rocket attack lasted for the better part of an hour and then suddenly stopped. But the entire government camp was now a smoldering ruin. Many camps had caught fire and could not be saved. The generals could only move their men to the less damaged camps. The morale of all the units was shattered, and they had lost their will to fight.

Qian Taichong saw that the fire was gradually dying down, and the chaotic noise was also subsiding. There was no sign that the rebels were taking the opportunity to attack the camp. Knowing that there was no danger for the night, he and Chang Qingyun quietly went down from the city wall. Their colleagues were in a sorry state. Some had lost their hairnets and hats, others their shoes, and some had their robes torn. In normal times, they would have made fun of each other, but now no one was laughing. The seriousness of the situation was palpable even to those who were not military experts.

Qian Taichong saw a dark object on the horse ramp, which seemed to be one of the rockets the rebels had fired into the city. He quickly went over and picked it up. The casing was still warm. He examined it. It was a cylindrical object, about two inches in diameter, made entirely of iron. The front was shattered, leaving only a large, dark opening. The back had many small holes and three slanted, spiral iron plates. It looked very sophisticated.

As he was examining it, Chang Qingyun pulled him. "What's there to see in this broken iron shell? Let's go back quickly!"

Qian Taichong had no choice but to carry the iron object and head down from the city wall.

When they got down from the city gate tower, they saw that the city gate was already closed. Many infantrymen had come from all over the city and were shouting insults at the government soldiers outside the walls. The outside was a scene of chaos. It turned out that the government soldiers outside the city had lost their camps and wanted to enter the city, but the government soldiers inside were worried that the influx of defeated soldiers would cause chaos in the city and refused to open the gates, claiming they had not received orders.

Back at Song Zonghui's residence, those who had not gone up to the city wall were still anxiously waiting for news. They had also seen the fierce rocket attack, but not as clearly and directly as those on the city wall. Now, hearing how intense the rebel rocket attack was and how powerful it was, they were all pale with fear.

"The rebels' rockets are truly terrifying! They burned down many houses in the city!" While they were talking, Song Zonghui hurried in. He had just been leading the city's militia to fight fires and maintain order and had just stopped to rest. He was covered in soot and grime, and his voice trembled as he spoke.

"The rebels did not take the opportunity to attack the camp. It was their mistake..." Lu Yizhong, who had only regained his composure after the fire attack was over, was still trying to comment.

"You are wrong. The rebels will surely attack with their full force at dawn. Do you think our army can fight again?" Qian Taichong said coldly. "Our army is defeated this time! The entire army must flee tomorrow, or we will die without a burial place!"
