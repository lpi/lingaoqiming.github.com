The clandestine activities of Chen Minggang and Huang Bingkun finally reached a climax. Not only did their secret activities reach a peak, but a violent incident finally occurred. A landowning household, unable to bear the repeated harassment and extortion of a tax enforcer, finally beat the man and threw him out.

Of course, violent incidents were common during the annual tax collection. Tax enforcers sometimes beat people, and sometimes they were beaten. It was not a major event. When Chen Minggang heard that his subordinate had been beaten, he was secretly pleased—violent resistance to tax collection, what a perfect charge. In the past, the county yamen didn't dare to offend them, but now the Australians would not stand for it.

He immediately ordered the grain this household had already paid to be written off, marking them as a delinquent household that had paid neither the standard tax nor the wastage rice.

For the past ten days or so, the wealthier the people in the county, the more alarmed and uneasy they became. Rumors spread that Chen Minggang had colluded with the 'Kunzei' and was preparing to make an example of a few large households, killing a chicken to warn the monkeys. There were also rumors that Chen Minggang was completely "issuing false imperial edicts." For a time, all sorts of true and false news flew about, making it impossible to distinguish.

Because they didn't know what the outcome of the negotiations would be, the large households were all nervously preparing: some were hiding their valuables, others were sending away their wives, children, and womenfolk, and still others were reinforcing their village walls. To win over the people, many large households also waived or reduced their tenants' rents and increased the wages of their long-term laborers and servants.

Some families even left their own homes to live in the more securely fortified villages of their relatives and friends. The tense atmosphere gradually reached its peak.

Based on reports from all sides, Wu De knew that Huang Bingkun had finished collecting the joint petition and was preparing to formally submit it in front of the management office building in the East Gate Market in three days. The local natives couldn't enter Bairen City, so for them, the management office building in the East Gate Market, with its imposing sign and "police" guards at the entrance, was the "yamen." This place did indeed have some of the characteristics of a yamen, such as mediating various disputes, leasing land, and arresting people.

As for Chen Minggang's group, they had also made their preparations. According to Chen Minggang's instructions, they had already found three people from the county to be scapegoats. It was agreed that if the Australians wanted to kill someone, they would be compensated with three hundred taels each. If they were sent to the labor reform team, they would be paid five taels of silver for each month they spent inside. Their families would receive thirty taels as a settlement allowance.

In case the Australians were not deceived by this, and the large households refused to let it go and demanded he hand over his key subordinates, Chen Minggang had also thought it through: he would hand over Zhou Qi. As his eldest apprentice, Zhou Qi's status was sufficient to satisfy everyone. He had grown tired of this apprentice, not only because of his behind-the-scenes machinations but also because of the widespread rumors in the county about Zhou Qi and Qiuhong.

As the saying goes, rumors can kill. The matter was originally completely baseless, and Chen Minggang knew there was no affair between the two. But the story had spread so widely and was so vivid that after a while, it seemed true, causing him to lose face.

Zhou Qi, however, appeared to be working very hard, going to the countryside every day and staying for several days at a time. But each time he returned, his face was heavy, and he didn't even dare to see Chen Minggang—it was probably because his work was not going smoothly.

"What a useless oaf," Chen Minggang cursed inwardly. This good-for-nothing apprentice had probably taken a large bribe and couldn't get it back now, making it difficult to ask for more. At this thought, he became even more convinced that his decision to throw Zhou Qi out as a scapegoat was correct.

The day for submitting the petition finally arrived. Huang Bingkun and Li Xiaopeng had originally planned to mobilize the students of the county school and the Moli Xuan Academy to submit the petition together, but this was dissuaded by Wang Ci—he believed the matter should not be blown out of proportion.

"Bingkun, it's enough for you and Mr. Liu to go together. If too many people go, with so many mouths, someone might say something inappropriate. If the Australians get angry, the matter won't be resolved even if you want it to be."

"We need to show them the backbone of the scholars of Lingao..."

"Bingkun!" Wang Ci stopped his grandiloquence. "Don't act on impulse! The Australians have weapons and are from outside our civilization. It's a rare thing that they now have some intention of assimilating. We can only proceed slowly. If you go and make a scene with the students in such a fiery manner, and you anger them—the dead cannot be brought back to life!"

Huang Bingkun calmed down and thought Wang Ci's words were right. He took a breath and said, "Your teachings are wise, sir."

"It's a rare opportunity that Mr. Liu is willing to come forward and uphold justice. You just need to accompany Mr. Liu with Xiaopeng and a few others. The Australians hold Mr. Liu in high regard. With him present, there will always be a chance for a turnaround."

Huang Bingkun meekly agreed. In his view, the Australians were greedy. With Liu Dalin present, the other party would surely make a superficial response and some symbolic concessions. The essence of their extortion would not change.

From his years of experience fighting bandits with his father, he knew that whether it was bandits or pirates, their root was grain. A large group of men would fall into chaos without food. The 'Kunzei' would be no exception. Since they had already controlled Lingao, they would not miss this opportunity to collect a large amount of grain.

But this was also good, Huang Bingkun thought. It could solidify the stance of the large households who had been harboring illusions. It would make future actions much easier.

The next morning, Huang Bingkun, Li Xiaopeng, and a few friends and servants went to Liu Dalin's residence in the west of the city. The place was already filled with Liu's relatives and friends who had fled from the countryside to seek his help. Hearing that Liu Dalin was going to personally negotiate the autumn grain tax with the Australians, everyone got up early and gathered under the eaves to see him off.

Liu Dalin, dressed in neat robes and a bright sash, was pushed out of the house by his servants. Seeing his righteous and awe-inspiring appearance, everyone praised him: truly a man of high virtue and integrity.

After Huang Bingkun and the others paid their respects, they pushed the wheelchair outside. The relatives and servants of the Liu family under the eaves all stopped to watch him go, and many continued to bow.

Sitting in his wheelchair, Liu Dalin felt a sense of heroic passion rise in his chest at the scene before him, and then he secretly chided himself for his wild thoughts. He wanted to say something, but couldn't think of the right words at the moment, so he could only cup his hands in return.

Outside the door, a bamboo and rattan sedan chair was already prepared. Everyone helped him into the sedan chair. Huang Bingkun and the others did not ride in a sedan chair or on horseback but followed on foot.

The county yamen, however, had its gates tightly shut. During the busy farming season, the yamen traditionally did not accept lawsuits. The matter of tax collection and land survey was too thorny. Fortunately, neither Liu Dalin nor Huang Bingkun had come to the yamen. Whether it was the gentry and large households or the Australians, they couldn't afford to offend either, so they were happy to play deaf and dumb.

"What if something really happens?" Wu Mingjin had a small worry about this. If a "tax riot" broke out during the tax collection, his career would be over.

A so-called tax riot was when the county's landowners refused to pay taxes on a large scale. This was, of course, a major crime against the law, but the county magistrate's responsibility was also heavy. Being dismissed from office was a certainty.

Wang Zhaomin, however, was very confident. He smiled with assurance and said, "My master! You're afraid of trouble, but aren't the Australians afraid too?"

Wu Mingjin nodded slightly, very impressed with his advisor.

"We just need to watch the changes quietly," Wang Zhaomin added with an air of profundity. Of course, for him and the magistrate, doing nothing was the best choice.

Liu Dalin's sedan chair arrived at the management office building in the East Gate Market. He sent someone to deliver his calling card. Dugu Qiuhun and Xiong Buyou were already waiting inside. They had received instructions from Wu De to receive the "petitioners"—and to do so with "full courtesy."

"Full courtesy for a landlord element?" Dugu Qiuhun said with dissatisfaction.

"What can we do? He's the only Jinshi. We're still planning to use him," Xiong Buyou said, standing up. He straightened his clothes and went out with Dugu Qiuhun to greet them.

This was Liu Dalin's first time visiting the Australians. And it was the Australians' yamen. He looked around with great curiosity. He saw a two-story building made of red brick, very square and regular. The windows were large and long, inlaid with sparkling glass...

"Too extravagant," Liu Dalin shook his head. He saw that the main door was semi-circular at the top and very tall. On each side of the door stood a yamen runner in a black coat and rattan hat. These were the so-called "police," and he had heard they were all local natives.

He saw two people emerge from the door, one tall and one short, one fat and one thin, a comical pair. Both were wearing blue cloth jackets with four pockets, no hats, and their hair was cut like monks'. They wore canvas shoes with strings. There was not a single piece of silk or satin on them, nor any accessories.

Liu Dalin was very surprised to see the Australian leaders dressed so simply. From what he had heard, the Australians were very good at making money and skilled at creating all sorts of strange and exquisite goods. They should have accumulated a considerable amount of wealth. Looking at what they did on a daily basis—building roads and bridges, opening schools, building large ships—each was a project that cost a fortune. He hadn't expected them to be so frugal in their personal enjoyment! A sense of respect grew in his heart.

Xiong Buyou came forward, exchanged a few pleasantries, and immediately led him and his entourage to the reception room on the second floor.

Upon entering the reception room, Liu Dalin almost laughed out loud. It seemed that although the Australians were capable, they were actually very crude. It was a large room with snow-white walls and a floor of fine wood. The autumn sunlight streamed in through the glass windows, making it very bright. But the furniture and decorations were completely haphazard.

On the walls, like a stall selling paintings, were densely hung various works of calligraphy and painting. Whether it was central scrolls, vertical scrolls, or screen inserts, there were even a few fan paintings. Landscapes, flowers and birds, meticulous brushwork, freehand brushwork, ink wash, blue-green... all sorts of styles were hung randomly everywhere. Among them were even a few Suzhou prints.

In the corners, a few large vases were placed randomly, with feather dusters stuck in them incongruously. These vases were half a person's height. They were not needed for industrial purposes, and no one wanted them to decorate their houses. It was a pity to destroy them, so they were put here to serve a purpose.

Clearly, the Australians' aesthetic sense was terrible. To call them nouveau riche would be a compliment. Liu Dalin shook his head inwardly. Even the local squires of this county had better taste than them.
