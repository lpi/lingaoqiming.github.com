Xihua was carried back to her quarters by several servant women, lying in bed in a daze. She had been born into a scholar's family with considerable wealth. But after a plague swept through, her parents and brothers died one after another. Her relatives seized her family's property and secretly plotted to sell her to a brothel, nearly driving her to suicide.

Though her life had been tragic and she had suffered mentally, she had never endured physical hardship. She had been raised as a delicate young lady, pampered and spoiled. How could she bear such pain? She lay in a stupor until the sky was completely dark before she woke up, feeling a burning, searing pain in her buttocks and legs. The slightest movement felt like being pricked with needles.

The room was dark; no lamps had been lit yet, and she didn't know what time it was. She managed to turn onto her side, her throat parched. She propped herself up and fumbled for the small cabinet by her bed—it was empty.

She was usually a "favorite" in the villa. Not only was she practically a "student" in Zhao Yigong's eyes, but she was also a figure of importance in the Cihuitang, responsible for teaching the children. She was a "person of real power" whom everyone in the villa feared to some extent. Coupled with her strong-willed, arrogant nature and her intolerance for any fault, she often embarrassed people. Therefore, although she had done many good things for the public, her popularity in the villa was average. This time she was beaten, and there were more people who were pleased than those who felt sorry for her. Who would come to visit, let alone bring her tea and water?

The moonlight outside was bright, casting a white glow on the brick floor in front of the window.

A sour feeling rose in Xihua's nose, and tears began to fall. She fumbled for a handkerchief from under her pillow to wipe them away. Suddenly, the door creaked open. It was Fenghua. She peeked in, made a "hush" gesture to Xihua, and then tiptoed in. First, she drew the curtain over the window, then she took out a box of matches from her pocket, struck one, and lit the candlestick on the table.

"Sister Fenghua!"

"Shh..." Fenghua pressed a finger to her lips. She placed a small carrying basket on the table and took out several porcelain bottles. "You lie on your stomach and don't move. I'll apply some medicine for you."

"Thank you, sister." Xihua didn't dare say more, afraid she would start sobbing. She buried her face in the pillow, tears streaming down. She had had many dealings with Fenghua before, but they were not close personally. Among Zhao Yigong's "attendants," Fenghua was the most plain-looking, but she was a naturalized citizen from Lingao and the eldest, one of Zhao Yigong's most trusted people. Xihua had always been resentful that this girl, so ordinary in looks and learning, could gain the Master's trust. Thus, she had always been cool and distant towards Fenghua. Furthermore, Fenghua's kind nature had earned her great popularity and prestige in the villa, which only made the ever-arrogant Xihua distance herself from her even more.

She never expected Fenghua to come and take care of her. A warmth spread through her heart, mixed with a hint of shame.

After Fenghua applied the medicine, she poured a bowl of medicinal soup from a thermos in the basket and fed it to her. The soup was slightly bitter but not hard to drink. After drinking it, her hot and feverish body felt cool, and even the stinging pain in her thighs lessened considerably.

"This is medicine bought from Lingao. The Master specifically told me to bring it for you," Fenghua whispered.

"Mmm..."

Fenghua covered her with a blanket, walked quietly to the door, opened it, and beckoned. A figure slipped in. Xihua saw that it seemed to be a man and almost cried out. Then she realized it was Zhao Yigong!

"Master!"

Zhao Yigong nodded. Fenghua had already moved a stool over, and Zhao Yigong sat down by the bed.

"I've come to see you. Don't move, just lie there. Does it hurt much?" Zhao Yigong saw her trying to sit up and placed a hand on her arm to stop her.

Xihua was an intelligent person. The Master visiting her quarters at night, coming to see her personally—she knew there must be a reason for today's punishment. However, she was angry that she had been publicly punished for "pleading for the people," especially when it was the Master himself who had told her that "education is fundamental" and "teaching and nurturing people is a hundred-year plan." The physical pain was bearable, but the humiliation was hard to let go of.

With such feelings, her words naturally lacked warmth. "It is only right and proper for a master to beat a servant. Even if I were beaten to death, it would be as it should be. This servant dares not cry out in pain. It is all what this servant deserves!"

Fenghua was about to scold her, but Zhao Yigong shook his head and said, "Today's matter was to make an example of you. You are an intelligent person; surely you understand."

"Yes, this servant understands," Xihua said in a low voice.

"The matter of the filature workers you spoke of, I have already told the management office: starting tomorrow, they will switch to a three-shift system, with a break every shichen. Also, the standard for work meals has been increased."

"..." Xihua's eyes widened, not understanding what the Master meant. She had always felt that the Master was too harsh on the contract slaves in the factory and that people would die there sooner or later. That was why she had spoken out in a moment of agitation. She never expected the Master to accept all of her suggestions at once.

"People are not grass or trees; how can they be without feelings? How could I not know that the filature is like a living hell?" Zhao Yigong smiled slightly, then concealed it. "It is easy for a person to have small benevolence and small righteousness, but difficult to have great benevolence and great righteousness. It is rare that you can live up to it!"

Even the ever-arrogant Xihua dared not accept such praise. "The Master speaks too highly. This servant is not worthy."

"How are you not worthy?" Zhao Yigong spoke with eloquence. "You hold one of the best positions in the villa, receiving top pay and rations. I, your Master, trust you and use you. You are a person of standing among the servants. You have no relatives or old friends in the filature—they are all people unrelated to you. To be willing to risk danger and speak out for their hardships, how is that not great benevolence and great righteousness?"

These words struck a chord deep within Xihua. In truth, she hadn't thought so much when she spoke out; it was just a moment of indignation. Now, with Zhao Yigong's explanation, the vague feelings she had suddenly became clear. For a moment, she was filled with a mix of emotions and, burying her face in her pillow, began to sob.

Fenghua quickly came over to comfort and console her, and it took a while to stop her tears.

"It's all this servant's fault..." Xihua, her eyes brimming with tears, tried to get up again.

Zhao Yigong stopped her. "No need to admit fault. You were not wrong. The matter of the filature was originally a temporary measure." He smiled again. "Besides, without your outburst today, how could we gain their trust?"

Xihua was a little confused. Hearing him say this, her mind became crystal clear. "Does the Master want this servant to be Huang Gai?" she asked.

"Clever! I originally wanted to tell you this beforehand to ease your mind. But if you were at ease, the act wouldn't have been convincing."

"This servant understands. What does the Master want this servant to do?"

Zhao Yigong's expression turned serious.

"You two are my confidants. It's alright to tell you now: someone is secretly plotting to destroy the Phoenix Villa."

This news was less shocking for Fenghua—after all, she was a naturalized citizen who had been in Lingao. She knew well the power of the Senate and that she and the "Chief" had come to Hangzhou to penetrate deep into enemy territory.

Since they were in enemy territory, they could be drawn into a life-or-death struggle at any time. But for Xihua, it was different. She had deep feelings for the Phoenix Villa. Originally a girl destined for the brothels, under Zhao Yigong, not only had her own fate been reversed, but she had also watched the Master build up his enterprise in Hangzhou from just the Wanbi Bookstore to its current scale. In particular, he had established the Cihuitang, which had saved countless people from starvation last year and this year. She, who handled the general affairs of the Cihuitang, knew this better than anyone.

For people like Xihua, the Phoenix Villa was like her home. Hearing that someone wanted to destroy it, her eyes widened, and she asked anxiously:

"Master! Who could be so vicious?"

"I don't know yet. That's why I need you to find them. Are you willing?" He paused for a moment. "This mission will take you deep into the tiger's den. It will likely be a matter of life and death. If you are unwilling to go, I will not blame you."

"This servant is willing!" Xihua said without hesitation. "Master, tell this servant what to do."

"Good." Zhao Yigong was deeply satisfied. He had not been wrong about her. "Rest and be patient for now. There are likely spies already mixed into this villa. Now that you have been disciplined, someone will naturally try to entice you. You just need to let things take their course."

"Yes! This servant understands," Xihua replied. "And what if no one comes?"

"Don't worry, someone will definitely come," Zhao Yigong smiled. "Only Fenghua and Zhao Tong know about this matter in the villa. If you need anything, just contact Fenghua. She will tell you what to do next."

"So, her popularity in the villa is average?" Hao Yuan put down the investigation report handwritten by Gou Chengxuan.

"Correct. The informants say that this Xihua is very arrogant and has a bad temper. She will publicly embarrass any of the managers in the villa, big or small, if they cross her. Many people hate her, but she does everything strictly by the villa's rules, so it's hard to find fault with her. That's why she's even more disliked."

"Oh?" Hao Yuan pondered for a moment. "You're talking about the managers. I'm asking about the ordinary people, like the refugees, servants, and female workers."

"She doesn't interact with them much. The people below think she's arrogant. But she's fair in her work, considerate of those below her, and willing to speak up for them, so she has a good reputation among them," Gou Chengxuan said. "This time she was disciplined by that bald Zhao for standing up for the female workers in the filature. According to the informants, this doesn't seem to be a fake act—she had said many days ago that she would report the matter of the filature to that bald Zhao."

"It seems this woman really has a chivalrous heart." Hao Yuan did not comment on whether it was an act or not. He tilted his head back, stared at the low ceiling for a long time, and then asked, "Did anyone visit her afterwards? How did Zhao Yigong deal with her subsequently?"

"I heard Fenghua visited her and even brought medicine for her wounds—which is to be expected. That bald Zhao hasn't issued any new punishment. The news from the management office is just that she's to rest for a few days."

Hao Yuan nodded. "Listen closely. This is what we'll do next..."
