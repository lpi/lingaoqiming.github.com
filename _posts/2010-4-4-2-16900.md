[Xiao Zishan][y001] felt he had been handed a hot potato, and was contemplating how to run this school. Since no one was interested in being a "king of the kids," he would temporarily serve as the principal. Of course, he would have to find an executive vice-principal, a task he would have to slowly work on. However, one thing was confirmed at the meeting: any transmigrator with "dependents" could receive a dependency allowance as a subsidy, which was seen as a humane policy.

The meeting also discussed cooperation with the Church. This was a particularly thorny issue. Besides using the Church to obtain personnel, technology, and materials from Europe, the transmigrators also hoped to use a new religion to provide spiritual solace and a moral code for their future citizens. However, they did not want the Church to have too much say or authority in social life—let alone authority that came from a foreign power.

"The Jesuits are trying their best to introduce Catholicism into China. Instead of letting them do it, why don't we do it ourselves?" [Wen Desi][y002] said.

"We do the missionary work?"

"Yes. Instead of passively blocking and defending, we should actively guide it," [Wen Desi][y002] explained his "self-centered" approach to missionary work. The so-called "self-centered" approach meant: I will allow you to establish a church; I will let you preach, but the control of the local church must be in our hands. The church can only be an appendage and a tool of the transmigrator regime.

"Can the Jesuits agree to this condition?" [Ma Qianzhu][y005] had no love for the Jesuits either.

"They will," Yu E'shui was quite confident. "The Jesuits have always been known in the history of the Catholic Church for their skill in 'saving the country by a roundabout way.' They are much more flexible than those fanatics who only know how to barbecue people."

"I don't have any objection to that. But how do we implement this 'self-centered' approach?"

[Wen Desi][y002] chuckled and said, "Do you know what a 'fait accompli' is?"

Bai Duolu had just finished his shift at the printing factory when he was summoned to [Wen Desi][y002]'s office.

"Xiao Bai, are you willing to contribute your strength to the organization?" [Wen Desi][y002] said in a deep voice from behind his desk.

Bai Duolu's scalp tingled and his legs trembled. According to the experience of the Chinese people, when a leader asks you this question, it's usually not good news.

"May I ask what it is about?" Bai Duolu asked cautiously.

"Well, it's a good thing. After discussion, the Executive Committee has decided to appoint you as the head of the Catholic Church in Lingao. For example, uh, a bishop."

"What?!" Bai Duolu almost jumped up. He was just an ordinary layman, not even a friar, and they wanted him to be a bishop! This was ridiculous.

"Father Lu Ruohua of the Jesuits has arrived in Lingao, and the Executive Committee is about to begin negotiations with him on church affairs," [Wen Desi][y002] glanced at the door. The Internal Affairs officer on guard immediately closed it, and the room darkened.

"Reaching a missionary agreement is probably inevitable," [Wen Desi][y002] said. "Even if we refuse, they will send priests to infiltrate and establish an underground church. You know about underground churches—"

Bai Duolu's scalp tingled—of course he knew about underground churches. He nodded.

"The Jesuits have already established a foothold in Ding'an County in Hainan. The power of the Wang Honghui family cannot be underestimated. He himself is a Jinshi, the Minister of Rites, and has connections with Matteo Ricci in Beijing. His son, Paul, is also very enthusiastic about missionary work. If we are not proactive, the Jesuits will focus their efforts on Ding'an. Once they gain a strong foothold there, we will face a Hainan church system that takes orders from the Jesuits in Macau after we unify Hainan." [Wen Desi][y002] wiped his glasses. "This cannot be allowed to happen."

"Yes."

"So our consideration is to establish our own church, with a transmigrator as its head. This way, the relationship between the Macau Jesuits and us will only be one of cooperation. Whoever comes will be a guest official. With you as the Bishop of Lingao, the Jesuits will not be able to seize ecclesiastical power, understand?"

Bai Duolu understood [Wen Desi][y002]'s meaning. He said, "A bishop needs to be consecrated by the Holy See. If we establish a so-called Catholic Church of Lingao here without the Pope's consecration, it would be a self-consecration. Neither the Jesuits nor the Holy See will recognize it."

As a Catholic, Bai Duolu certainly knew that the Church had always placed great importance on the right to appoint bishops.

"Our Australian Church is a 'lost church,'" [Wen Desi][y002] had already thought this through. "A lost church expressing its loyalty to the Holy See, the Holy See will be overjoyed. They won't get bogged down in the issue of consecration. They will most likely recognize the result retroactively. So we will arrange for you to be the bishop of the Australian Church, currently presiding over the church affairs in Lingao. The Jesuits, for the sake of a breakthrough in their missionary work, will most likely agree to these conditions."

[Wen Desi][y002] was extremely confident in this deduction. What era was this? It was the era after the Reformation, when the power of the Catholic Church was in constant decline. Catholic Spain had been defeated twice by Protestant England and was at the end of its rope. Protestant England and the Netherlands were on the rise. Germany was struggling in the bloodbath of the Thirty Years' War. The Catholic Church was facing attacks and challenges everywhere. The appearance of an Australian Catholic Church at this time would be an excellent stimulant for the Church. [Wen Desi][y002] did not think that Lu Ruohua, the Jesuits, and the Holy See would fail to see the Executive Committee's intentions, but the benefits the transmigrators offered in exchange would be enough to move them.

Bai Duolu himself was a Catholic, with sufficient knowledge of religious texts and the Church. He was the most suitable candidate to be the "Bishop of Lingao" of this fictitious Australian Church.

Unexpectedly, after some consideration, Bai Duolu refused.

"[Chief Wen][y002], I don't think I can do this."

"Why?"

Bai Duolu said with a stiff upper lip, "[Chief Wen][y002], being a bishop requires taking a vow. Once you take the vow, you have to remain chaste for life. I still want to get married."

[Wen Desi][y002] thought this was a troublesome matter. This bishopric was not a one-or-two-day affair. People didn't transmigrate to become foreign monks.

"It's okay. You can just return to secular life later."

"No, that's not good," Bai Duolu shook his head repeatedly. "If I become the Bishop of Lingao, according to your estimation, [Chief Wen][y002], the Holy See will probably consecrate me. At that point, my religious beliefs will not allow me to return to secular life—but I don't want to be a monk."

It seemed that religious belief was indeed a stubborn thing, [Wen Desi][y002] cursed inwardly. He then continued to try to persuade him.

"We can reform the church system, allow clergy to marry, and so on."

Bai Duolu still shook his head stubbornly. "That would be called the Chinese Catholic Church or some other Chinese Jesuit Church, not the Catholic Church. Although my faith is not very strong, I don't want to make a false vow."

It seemed that this Catholic was of no use. This disappointed [Wen Desi][y002] greatly. Seeing his face darken, Bai Duolu knew things were not good and quickly added, "But I am willing to assist the Executive Committee in all church work, as long as you don't make me impersonate a clergyman and become a monk."

Seeing his firm attitude, [Wen Desi][y002] was at a loss. However, if Bai Duolu was willing to cooperate to a limited extent, there was still something to be done. Compared to Bai Duolu, Miss Mendoza was even less reliable.

Since Bai Duolu was unwilling, it would be difficult to find a fake bishop immediately. In fact, it would be difficult for Bai Duolu to impersonate a bishop anyway. He was no theologian, not to mention that most people here had never even read the Bible.

"Then you can be a priest. It seems that this doesn't require a vow."

"Alright," Bai Duolu yielded.

"We also need a church," [Wen Desi][y002] stroked his chin in thought. However, it would be more appropriate for the Jesuits in Macau to pay for this church. [Wen Desi][y002] had another idea and immediately called Dingding.

After hanging up the phone, he considered the team. Bai Duolu's attitude showed one thing—he was not reliable on religious issues. Therefore, more reliable people had to be sent to work with him—preferably someone who knew French. In addition, a few natives had to be prepared as an audience to make Lu Ruohua feel that the atmosphere here was good.

As soon as Lu Ruohua disembarked, he was put into the quarantine camp at Lingao Cape. This camp was now occupied every day. The Guangzhou station sent about 100 children and teenagers from Guangzhou almost every week. These people were "purified" here and waited for the quarantine period to pass while learning some basic cultural skills. Lu Ruohua also received the full "purification" treatment. He was stripped naked, his hair was shaved, and he was scrubbed with brushes and cold water. He accepted all these ordeals with the high tolerance of a martyr—until he was forcibly held down and his buttocks were spread open for inspection. He panicked, thinking that these heathens were going to commit the evil sin of Sodom on him. Unexpectedly, they just looked and it was over. Later, someone told him that this was a health check. Lu Ruohua had also studied medicine—this procedure should be to check for hemorrhoids, but he didn't understand: hemorrhoids were not a contagious disease, why were the Australians so concerned about it? Were their hemorrhoids very serious?

The people in the quarantine camp were very polite to him. They arranged a separate room for him, which had a bed with clean straw mats and felt blankets. His luggage and clothes were also sent to him—the clothes had obviously been washed.

Lu Ruohua was told that he could do whatever he wanted in his room, but he was not allowed to go out except to go to the toilet. A guard was stationed at the door. Three meals a day were brought to him, which consisted of rice porridge with fish. Apart from the lack of freedom of movement, everything was quite good.

This life of confinement was not lonely. Every day, a well-mannered person came to chat with him in his native language: French.

Lu Ruohua was surprised to find that the transmigrators had a very clear concept of France, unlike other Chinese who thought that knowing about the "country of Europe" was a great understanding of the world. This surprised the missionary a little—because neither in France nor in all of Europe had anyone heard of a place called the "country of Australia." Yet the country of Australia knew about France.

What surprised him even more was that this was the first local he had met since coming to the East who had a complete understanding of French history, not just ancient history, but also Cardinal Richelieu and his siege of the fortress of La Rochelle starting in 1627. This news had taken almost a month to reach Vienna! Someone in the distant East, thousands of miles away, actually knew about this.
