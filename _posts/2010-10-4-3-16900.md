"Once the county's miscellaneous grain production increases, I'll directly manufacture and sell complete compound feed to the farmers, so they don't have to mix it themselves," Wu Nanhai's ambition was great. "This will further increase output, reduce technical difficulty, and make promotion easier."

With that, Wu Nanhai, riding his 28-inch bicycle, took Wan Lihui to a corner of the farm. A large plot of land had already been leveled here. Rows of small trees were planted around it, and drainage ditches had been dug.

The most conspicuous sight was the many large baskets piled up not far from the flat ground. Although covered with straw mats, they still emitted a pungent stench. Rotting liquid seeped onto the ground, and flies danced merrily above it.

Wan Lihui immediately spotted his brother, Wan Lihuang, wearing a straw hat and sitting idly in a grass shed, occasionally swatting at the flies.

Wan Lihui covered his nose. "Why does it stink so much?"

Wu Nanhai seemed completely unfazed, leaning his bike against a tree.

"Little Wan, from now on, you and your brother will be in charge of this earthworm farm."

"Alright," Wan Lihui thought. Great, another stinky, dirty job has fallen on our heads. Is it because we come from a peasant background? He thought with indignation. His dream in coming to this time was to play with guns freely. Now, he hadn't touched a gun and was back to doing farm labor.

Though he thought this, he couldn't let it show on his face. He quickly said he would resolutely complete the task assigned by the organization.

Artificial earthworm farming was a new agricultural technology. Its main purpose was to provide a low-cost protein feed for livestock, poultry, and fish, while also processing various organic wastes, turning waste into fertilizer, and eliminating environmental pollution from organic waste. It could also improve soil fertility to a certain extent.

The earthworms Wu Nanhai planned to raise were red worms, a common species in the vermiculture industry. They belonged to the manure worm category, favored consuming all kinds of livestock manure, had a strong affinity for fertilizer, and were suitable for artificial cultivation.

"Look, these are the red worms we're preparing to raise," Wu Nanhai opened the wooden box. Inside, several 90-150 mm long, purplish-red earthworms were wriggling.

"These things are very easy to raise, provided the feed is prepared properly," Wu Nanhai led them to the baskets, whose smell was simply atrocious.

"The feed for the earthworms," he said, "comes from a wide range of sources. Basically, any organic waste can be used, as long as it's non-toxic and disease-free. For example, livestock manure, plants, fruit peels, sugarcane bagasse, rotten fruits, etc. Red worms particularly like rotten fruits and vegetable leaves—they prefer sweet and sour flavors."

"Rotten fruit isn't common around here—" Wan Lihui thought that ever since Wu Nanhai started his comprehensive fertilization plan, it seemed no organic matter could escape his grasp. He wondered how Wu Nanhai planned to allocate organic waste to the earthworms. He didn't know what was in that big pit, but it stank to high heaven.

"Rotten vegetable leaves will do just fine. And wild fruits," Wu Nanhai seemed to have it all figured out. "We'll have a few boatloads of jackfruit transported from Leizhou—they have tons of it there, and also sugarcane bagasse." With that, he pulled down the mat covering one of the baskets.

Inside the basket were rotting jackfruit and a lot of sugarcane bagasse. The sweet, sour, and foul smell made him cover his nose.

"This needs to be composted quickly too," Wu Nanhai frowned.

Organic matter used as feed must first be fully fermented. Earthworms are omnivorous annelids. This organic waste must be composted and fermented before it can be consumed; otherwise, it will cause mass death among the earthworms. So, in reality, a major task for the Wan brothers was composting and fermentation.

Wu Nanhai personally took a shovel and began shoveling out the various organic wastes to demonstrate the composting process.

Before fermentation, all livestock and poultry manure had to be sprinkled with water and broken up. Crop stalks and rice straw were first chopped into short pieces with a hoe. Rotten fruit and sugarcane bagasse could be used directly. After piling them up, they were watered and mixed evenly to ensure they were thoroughly moist, then piled on the ground to a height of one meter. The pile should be loose, not compacted, to facilitate the breeding of high-temperature bacteria. Then it was sprinkled with water again, maintaining a moisture content between 50-60%.

Once the feed was piled up, it was covered with a plastic sheet to retain heat and moisture. Since they couldn't get large plastic sheets, this advanced item was replaced with straw mats. Water was then sprinkled on top to keep the mats moist.

"After three to four days, the temperature inside the piled organic waste can rise to 50-60°C," Wu Nanhai opened his briefcase and took out a rod-like object wrapped in straw rope. He carefully unwrapped it, revealing a huge glass rod—the latest alcohol thermometer from the glass factory. Its ugly appearance was reminiscent of a vibrator, enough to send otaku minds into a frenzy of imagination.

"A thermometer. You need to monitor the compost temperature daily. Too low or too high is not suitable. You can turn the pile once every half a month and add water. After three or four turnings, the mature compost should be dark brown, odorless, loose in texture, and not sticky. Then it's ready to use."

Wan Lihui watched as Wu Nanhai opened up a small pile and reached in to grab a handful of mature compost. "Just like this."

This action made him feel a sense of admiration: not bad, this is what an agricultural technician should be like.

Then, Wu Nanhai began to show them how to make an earthworm bed. He piled the mature compost into ridges 80 cm wide and 200-300 cm long, then watered them. Finally, he poured the earthworms from the wooden box onto it. The earthworms almost immediately burrowed into the feed.

"If they refuse to go in, it means the feed isn't properly fermented," Wu Nanhai said. "This batch is the breeding stock we brought with the ship, only a few dozen. Normally, each earthworm bed can be inoculated with a thousand worms. In about three to four months, you can reach 15,000 worms per square meter. At that point, you can start harvesting. Soon, the earthworms can be used as feed, and their castings can be used as feed for fish and shrimp, as well as fertilizer."

Wu Nanhai then gave him a mimeographed booklet titled "Earthworm and Maggot Farming Techniques," with a line printed on it: "Internal Material, for Agriculture Committee Use Only."

"Earthworm farming is relatively simple. The main things are maintaining temperature, moisture, and ventilation, and also processing the feed."

"Farming them like this, it will take at least a quarter to reach mass production capacity. Will that be in time?"

"It will be," Wu Nanhai said. "Our lending scale will be very small at the beginning—we don't have that many chicks, so the demand for formulated feed won't be large."

After giving his instructions, Wu Nanhai gave him an inventory list of all the tools needed for earthworm farming, things like rakes and shovels, and a few masks from the pharmaceutical factory.

"These are now under your name. Masks can be replaced as needed—make sure to protect yourselves during labor. Take good care of the farm tools."

He then hopped on his bicycle and rode off. The Wan brothers sat by the earthworm bed, looking at each other.

"Brother, didn't you say we could get guns and shoot Japanese invaders for fun when we came here?" Wan Lihuang looked at his brother. "Why does it seem like we're doing farm work all day long..."

"Well—" Wan Lihui was at a loss for words. The reality was too far from casually using Japanese soldiers as target practice. "Let's just focus on building the new countryside for now."

"Then why did we come here to build it? We could have just gone back to our hometown and built it there..."

"Enough with the 'whys'!" Wan Lihui finally lost his patience. "Go compost!"

And so, the Wan brothers began their new rural construction work in the new time and space.

Wu Nanhai rode his bicycle leisurely along the ridges of the fields. He frequently encountered his farm workers along the way. Everyone was already used to this "iron-wheeled vehicle," and no one came over to gawk. They just stood respectfully and waited for him to pass. Wu Nanhai would, as usual, greet the workers. This wasn't a show of "being close to the people," but his naturally kind and generous nature.

This time, he didn't return to his office at the farm but went to the newly built breeding farm instead.

In the past, the breeding farm was just a small part of the main farm, basically a courtyard-style operation. Subsequently, through spoils of war, trade, and other means, the number of livestock and poultry continued to increase. Furthermore, in the spring, under the guidance of a professional veterinarian like Yang Baogui, the Agriculture Committee launched a large-scale artificial insemination campaign—the results were significant, and it was clear that the population would expand further by late summer and early autumn. The Agriculture Committee decided to establish a permanent breeding farm before then.

The breeding farm was located near the stables originally built for Nick. In fact, the Agriculture Committee had its eye on this piece of land for a long time. When they built the stables for Nick, they had considered buying it all at once.

However, within this large expanse of wasteland, there was a plot of about two hundred mu that had an owner. Some peanuts had been planted on it, but it looked like it had been abandoned for a long time.

Ownerless land could be claimed with a deed from the county government after some paperwork and a small fee, but negotiations with the owner of this plot took a considerable amount of time. This landlord was a stubborn character. When Wu Nanhai, accompanied by Zhang Youfu, visited him, he couldn't believe the man was actually a landlord—his house had a thatched roof. Although he was as poor as any small peasant, the landlord refused to sell this piece of land that he no longer cultivated and had no ability to cultivate. It was said that if he sold it, he would no longer be considered a landlord. To maintain this empty title, he resolutely refused to sell. Multiple negotiation attempts were fruitless. Dugu Qiuhun, who learned of the matter, even considered using his police force to seize it by force. Zhang Youfu suggested that if the transmigrators didn't want to get their own hands dirty, they could forge a deed and, through Wang Shiye's connections, spend a hundred taels of silver to file a lawsuit at the county court—a guaranteed win.

"No, absolutely not," Wu Nanhai shook his head as soon as he heard it. He was unwilling from the bottom of his heart to engage in such collusion with officials and bullying tactics. The others also felt that these methods were too dirty and would seriously damage the image of the transmigrator group. The rottenness of the Ming Dynasty was the Ming Dynasty's problem; they were currently in the primary stage of a revolution and needed to maintain their great, glorious, and correct image.
