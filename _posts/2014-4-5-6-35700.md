Zhuo Yifan returned to the courtyard and closed the door.

He smiled and bowed to the people still in the courtyard. "Everyone, thank you for your hard work on the journey." He bowed deeply.

Since Guangzhou, these dozen or so people had been putting on the airs of a wealthy family. It was one thing for Zhuo Yifan to play the "master," but most of them were "servants," and several were well-known figures in the martial arts world. It was not easy for them to be ordered around and to genuinely serve others.

"We have come to a dragon's den for a life-or-death mission. A little hardship is nothing," said the "steward" in the courtyard, shaking his head. "I only hope that we can succeed in one blow and not fail the trust of our superiors!"

"We are here to serve the court and relieve the suffering of the common people," added another man dressed as a servant. "We are willing to risk our lives, so this little hardship is nothing. Young Master Zhuo, you don't have to be so polite."

These two "servants" were the most senior and had the highest status in the courtyard. With their statement, the others could only agree.

Zhuo Yifan bowed again. He then said to the "steward," "I'll have to trouble you with the housing arrangements, Uncle Wan."

The "steward," whose name was Wan Lifeng, also known as the "Wind-Chasing Sword," had been a bodyguard in his early years and was familiar with the ways of wealthy families on the road. This was like returning to his old profession. He nodded. "Don't worry, leave it to me."

Zhuo Yifan walked to the veranda, where several men and women were already standing. A glance told him that only the disciples of the Hengshan Sect remained in the main room.

The Hengshan Sect was composed entirely of women, and their style was somewhat "unconventional." Zhuo Yifan had seen a lot of it on their journey.

Zhuo Yifan stood at the door, not entering. It was a room full of women, and he wanted to avoid any suspicion. He spoke through the fine bamboo curtain:

"Abbess, the attendant has left."

"Is that you, Young Master Zhuo? Please come in and speak."

"Yes."

Zhuo Yifan lifted the bamboo curtain and entered.

The "old woman" sat in the center, with the female disciples standing on either side. Although the room was cool, beads of sweat continuously dripped from the old woman's face and forehead. She held a towel and wiped it from time to time, her demeanor no longer as "dignified" as before.

The one disguised as the "old woman" was none other than Abbess Miejing of the Hengshan Sect. The maids beside her were mostly young disciples of her sect.

Although the abbess had been treated with respect on the journey, it had not been easy for her. To conceal her identity as a nun, she had to wear a heavy wig at all times, except when she slept at night. After Guangzhou, the weather grew hotter each day. The heavy and stuffy wig was not a pleasant experience.

"Young Master Zhuo, please sit."

"Yes, thank you, Abbess." Zhuo Yifan's attitude was very respectful—the superiors of the Hengshan Sect had somewhat eccentric tempers.

"Is everything settled outside?"

"The luggage has been delivered, and everyone's quarters have been arranged," Zhuo Yifan reported. "You and the other disciples of your sect will stay in this main house. I will have the luggage brought in shortly. I will also tell the attendant that you are observing a vegetarian diet and have them prepare a high-quality vegetarian meal."

Miejing's face was expressionless. Hearing that he had made the arrangements without any issues, she nodded. "You've gone to a lot of trouble."

"Not at all, Abbess. You are my elder. This is my duty. I will go out tonight to contact Seventh Master and the others. I will report back to you tomorrow when I have news."

Miejing nodded. "Go ahead. I hear the 髡's agents are very formidable, like the Imperial Guard, and there are many scoundrels from the martial arts world among them. You must be careful."

"Yes, I know. Please don't worry, Abbess."

Miejing nodded slightly and said no more.

Zhuo Yifan returned to the courtyard. Wan Lifeng had already arranged the housing. Besides the Hengshan Sect disciples who lived in the small courtyard, the other women also stayed there. The men all lived in the large courtyard.

As for the luggage, there wasn't much. Besides personal clothing and bedding, there were only swords and other weapons, all hidden in boxes.

The large and small official boxes that filled the carriages were mostly filled with bricks and rubble, a mere deception. Although they were all fake, Wan Lifeng didn't dare to leave them outside, fearing the attendants would become suspicious. So he painstakingly moved them all into the side rooms.

After a busy period of settling in, Abbess Miejing sent two disciples to bring the fruit and a large jar of sour plum soup, delivered by the attendant, to the large courtyard for everyone to cool down.

The group was sweaty from moving boxes. With these refreshing items, they couldn't be bothered with decorum. They each found a spot in the shade of the trees or under the eaves and sat down to eat and drink.

Zhuo Yifan was the leader. Although he was young, his position was not low. The stone table and chairs under the grape arbor in the courtyard were given to him and a few of the other leaders of the group: Wan Lifeng, Sha Guangtian, and Meng Bofei.

These three were all influential figures in the martial arts world. Zhuo Yifan knew that their willingness to get involved in this mess was not solely due to the prestige of his master, the White Stone Daoist, or the grand cause of "serving the court and relieving the suffering of the people."

Zhuo Yifan only knew that the mastermind behind this operation was "Shi Weng." He had no idea who this Shi Weng was. However, to be able to mobilize so many martial arts heroes, he must be a person of great power in both the court and the common world.

"What's our next step?"

"We wait for the right opportunity," Zhuo Yifan said. "This is the heart of the 髡's territory. Everyone, do not act rashly. I will first contact Mr. Sima, and then we will discuss other matters. Uncle Wan—you will continue to play the role of the steward. Although we are behind closed doors, we must still maintain the proper etiquette. We must not reveal any flaws. If an attendant sees something and reports it, it will ruin everything! Naturally, some of our comrades will have to endure some grievances..."

"Yes, I understand," Wan Lifeng nodded. "We have all been in the martial arts world for many years. We understand this."

"We must put on a good show, but not overdo it. We are, after all, a family of scholars and officials. We can't act like nouveau riche."

The others chuckled. Zhuo Yifan then said to Sha and Meng, "You two uncles will continue to act as guards. Keep a close watch on the gate, guard it during the day, and post sentries at night. Especially at the Abbess's place, we must prevent any strangers from entering—it's easy for her to be exposed there."

A knowing smile appeared on their faces. After arriving in Lingao, there was no need for the Abbess to continue suffering with the wig. But if someone were to see her, it would immediately become a major news story.

"Unless necessary, do not leave the inn. Don't even go out of the courtyard gate easily. As for gathering information and exploring the area, we will talk about it after I meet with Sima—after all, they arrived half a month earlier."

The three of them nodded in unison. As they were talking, the doorbell suddenly rang loudly. Everyone was startled and jumped to their feet. Zhuo Yifan quickly waved his hand, signaling Wan Lifeng to answer the door.

The others in the courtyard quickly gathered the fruit and tea cups and hid in their rooms. Sha and Meng stood at attention under the eaves.

When the courtyard door opened, it was Li Xiaoliu, holding a thick stack of papers. He smiled obsequiously before speaking. It turned out he was here to inform them about the household registration tomorrow.

"...This is the household registration form. Since the young master and the old mistress will be staying in Lingao for a long time, according to the rules here, you must register for a temporary household. This is a government rule, so please bear with us." Li Xiaoliu bowed and then said, "Tomorrow, the household registration police from the East Gate Market police station will come here to verify and register everyone. Please stay in the inn and don't go out, so as not to miss the official business and cause inconvenience later."

Zhuo Yifan thought to himself that these 髡's were quite arrogant. A mere public servant had such a grand air, daring to tell a wealthy family like them to "wait for verification." He wondered how they usually oppressed the common people. He was quite disdainful.

As expected, Wan Lifeng frowned. "Filling out the household registration form is one thing. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. But for a mere public servant to make our young master and old mistress 'wait,' that's too much..."

The attendant quickly said, "Steward! You can't say that. According to the chiefs' rules, you must go to the police station to register. Our inn's young master went to great lengths to get them to come to the inn for verification and issuance of certificates. This is already a special exception. You all saw what happened to that family earlier—who knows how that will end."

"What's the background of that policewoman? How can she be so fierce?"

"That one? She's a security police officer from the East Gate Market police station, named Lian Nishang. She's the most shrewish of them all." The attendant said with a grin, "She's a good person, but don't get any 'improper' ideas about her."

"So they're really going to make their womenfolk parade on the street and wait in line?" Wan Lifeng wanted to get more information out of him and led him on. "It's just a matter of spending a little money."

"It's hard to say!" the attendant shook his head. "Spending money is out of the question. It all depends on whether our owner can persuade the police station to be lenient. In my opinion, it's unlikely!"

"Are the laws in Lingao so strict?"

"Yes, so I'm also reminding you all: this place is not like the Great Ming. Don't break the Australians' rules."

"Thank you, little brother." Wan Lifeng took out a circulation coupon from his pocket and slipped it to him. "Take this for tea."

"Thank you for the reward, steward." Li Xiaoliu smiled and bowed again. He then asked solicitously about the dinner arrangements and whether they needed to arrange for a carriage or rickshaw to go sightseeing in East Gate Market.

"For dinner, just arrange the first-class standard according to the guest register. Our old mistress is a vegetarian, so prepare a vegetarian meal. As for the carriage, we don't need it for now. We are tired from the journey and want to rest early today. Please prepare more hot water for the evening."

"Yes, I understand." Li Xiaoliu smiled. "As for hot water, our inn has a supply in the evening. You can just turn on the tap and use it at any time."
