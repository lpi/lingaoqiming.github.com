While vigorously scraping the recycled grain off his shoe, Huang Binkun cursed the Ming officials of Guangzhou. A fine city like Guangzhou was governed worse than the Cropped-Hair Bandits' tiny Lingao. They were truly a bunch of incompetents.

As he was hesitating, he suddenly heard a street vendor shout: "Australian picture show, get your Australian picture show!" A group of children ran out from an alley, rushing past Huang Binkun and knocking the unsteady man off balance.

"Boys, don't rush! One copper cash for one look, one cent of circulation notes for two looks—" Huang Binkun didn't see the circulation notes he was already familiar with in Lingao, nor did he understand the concept of "starting with the children," but seeing the kids flocking to it, he realized his trip to Guangzhou would not be smooth.

"The Cropped-Hair Bandits, how venomous are their intentions."

After much hesitation, Huang Binkun settled into a branch inn of the Qiwei Inn chain. Not only was it clean and tidy, but more importantly, he could use circulation notes directly, which saved him from an immediate financial crisis. In Lingao, silver had become increasingly rare, gradually being replaced entirely by circulation notes. The coffers of the Huang family village were now filled with these notes. It was hard to even find a silver coin. Although Old Master Huang still had several earthenware jars buried under his study floor containing five or six hundred taels of silver, that was the family's emergency fund and couldn't be used lightly. The silver he was using now had been exchanged at the Delong Bank with his travel permit—he had only managed to get twenty taels in total. He had to find a private money changer in the East Gate Market to exchange for another dozen or so taels.

Huang Binkun settled into the inn, took a bath in the inn's bathhouse, changed into clean clothes, and felt a sense of relief. The unpleasant feelings he had upon entering Guangzhou faded away.

However, during his journey, he had come to realize just how deeply the Cropped-Hair Bandits had infiltrated Guangzhou. "I'd better settle down first and then figure things out."

The only method Huang Binkun could think of was to use connections to find influential people. The ideal scenario, of course, was to become a retainer. But he was just a mere scholar, an unknown from a remote border county. To become a retainer, he would need a recommendation from a powerful figure.

Unfortunately, while his family was considered a "prominent clan" in Lingao, they were insignificant in the context of all of Guangdong. In Guangzhou city alone, it was doubtful how many people even knew there was a county called Lingao in the province.

He had no relatives or friends here. The distant relative who was planning to move to Lingao was not from Guangzhou Prefecture and couldn't help him. He had a letter from Liu Dalin in his pocket, addressed to one of his fellow successful examination candidates, but he had just inquired and found out that this gentleman had passed away a few months ago.

At this thought, his ambitions felt incredibly distant. He remembered coming to Guangzhou with his father on business as a boy, how his halting, accented Cantonese had earned him much ridicule and mockery. The memory was still fresh.

After much thought, the only way was "scholarly travel"—to get in touch with the local scholar circles and try to integrate. Although scholars ranged from rich to poor, it shouldn't be too difficult to befriend them with his status as a scholar.

However, figuring out who to cultivate a relationship with and who to ignore would require some effort. Huang Binkun planned to go to a bookstore to buy a *Register of Officials* and see who on the list required his special attention.

After settling in, Huang Binkun followed someone's directions the next day and arrived at a large bookstore in Guangzhou. As soon as he entered, he saw a clerk at the door. With a gap-toothed grin, the clerk greeted him, "Sir, please come in. We have a new arrival of all kinds of Australian-style books..."

The words "Australian" were the last thing Huang Binkun wanted to hear. His face immediately darkened. He repeatedly said, "No, no."

The clerk, having been rebuffed, heard his strange Cantonese accent and muttered to himself, "So he's a country bumpkin!"

But for the sake of his sales commission, he continued to push tirelessly.

"Sir, look, the storybooks in the bookstores now, apart from the Four Great Talented Scholars series, the most interesting are the magazines from Australia. Sir, take a look—"

"I just want a *Register of Officials*!" Huang Binkun's tone was growing impatient.

"We have it, we have it. That's a common book. Sir, won't you look at something else first..."

Huang Binkun waved his hand impatiently. The clerk could only go fetch it resentfully.

While the clerk dawdled, Huang Binkun took the opportunity to browse the bookstore. The books on the tables were all bestsellers. Besides the traditional collections of classics, contemporary essays, storybooks, and household encyclopedias, more than half the table was filled with so-called "new books." Judging by the horizontal layout and simplified characters, these new books were unmistakably from the Cropped-Hair Bandits—he had seen plenty in Lingao.

Besides the *Record of the Zheng Rebels' Atrocities*, which he had already read, there were many he had never seen before. In particular, many "Australian books" were not even seen in the libraries and bookshops of the Australians in Lingao: titles like *How Hongxiu Was Made*, *Thirty-Six Stratagems for Keeping Favor at Home: Bedroom Edition*, *The Art of Soup-Making for Health*, *Learning to Cook Australian Cuisine*, *Outwitting the Chief Examiner: The Examination Journeys of Eighteen Provincial Graduates*, *The Art of Serving Superiors*, *The Way of the Retainer*...

These were one thing; such "lifestyle books" had existed in Ming bookstores for a long time. But they were never so "comprehensive" and "simple." He picked one up at random; it was filled with a large number of lifelike illustrations, completely different from the woodblock prints in ordinary books.

Judging by the wear on the covers, these books were very popular. Many people read them, and presumably, many bought them. But he had no interest in these. His gaze shifted to the "Australian Studies" books. The cover of the first one had a large drawing of a sailing ship, looking much like a red-haired barbarian's warship. The title was *Warship Knowledge*. A book cover with such a large illustration was already rare, and in the bottom right corner were subtitles: "How Did the Spanish Navy Lose to the English Pirates?", "The Battle of Noryang"... Huang Binkun didn't know who the Spanish were, nor where the so-called "Noryang" was. It seemed to be about military strategy and war history. Looking around, he saw similar books, large in format and not thin. Titles like *With and Without a Horse: The World of Inertia*, *War History Research*, and so on. These books were not cheap, costing one or two taels of silver each.

*The state of the nation is getting worse by the day. Even the Cropped-Hair Bandits know that scholars are most concerned with military affairs now,* Huang Binkun sighed to himself. Suddenly, he caught sight of a book, *Win Just by Reading: How to Annihilate the Eastern Barbarians*. *Hmph, what arrogance. The Cropped-Hair Bandits are truly shameless, boasting that one can win just by reading?* He picked up the book. It wasn't very thick, and there was no picture on the plain cover. The author was Shi Zhengxin. He opened the frontispiece and was startled. On the page was a portrait of a man, bald with no hair, a hooked nose and a wolfish neck, wearing the uniform of the Cropped-Hair Bandits, a round pair of glasses, and a fine Japanese sword on his shoulder. The man looked like a monk, a general, and a scholar all at once. What was even more amazing was that the portrait was so lifelike, as if the man were standing right in front of him. Huang Binkun was engrossed in the picture when he noticed the clerk had already wrapped the *Register of Officials* and was standing by his side. "Sir, the book you wanted is ready."

"Oh, who is this on the book?" Huang Binkun asked, pointing at the portrait.

"Sir, I've heard everyone say this is the author. They say he's a Senator of the Australians, surnamed Shi, given name Zhiqi, style name Zhengxin. He's currently leading troops and stationed on Hong Kong Island to the south," the clerk said nonchalantly. "Back in the day, this Chief Shi led his men on small boats and roamed the Pearl River as if no one could stop him."

Huang Binkun nodded thoughtfully. The clerk quickly added, "Sir, this book costs four taels of silver, but if you use Australian circulation notes, you can get a 20% discount."

"I don't want it!" Huang Binkun suddenly became very angry, hastily paid for the *Register of Officials* with silver, and turned to leave. The clerk watched his departing back with disdainful eyes, "Country bumpkin!"

Huang Binkun ignored the clerk's contemptuous gaze, clutched the *Register of Officials* to his chest, and went straight back to the inn, thinking, *The Cropped-Hair Bandits buy favor in the market, and the common folk of Guangzhou adore them so. I fear even the gentry and scholars may not understand the bandits' methods!*

Huang Binkun flipped through the *Register of Officials* for a long time but couldn't make heads or tails of it. He circled a dozen names of gentry marked as "in residence" in Guangzhou Prefecture, but looking at their resumes, the lowest-ranking was a provincial graduate who had served as a county magistrate. With his status, a stranger with no connections, let alone paying a visit, would probably be ignored by the doorman.

It seemed his only option was to befriend more scholars. He called for a clerk and asked where the literary gatherings in Guangzhou were held. The clerk said that there were the Eight Scenic Spots of Guangzhou, where literary banquets and gatherings were held almost daily. If he was interested, he could go and have a look anytime.

So, the next day, Huang Binkun changed into a decent-looking robe and went "touring." However, he was soon greatly disappointed. There were indeed many scholars holding gatherings in these places, but they were surrounded by servants and guards. Not only could he not get close enough to strike up a conversation, but he was driven away as an "idler" before he even got near.

After much thought, his only option was to brazenly go to the Nanhai County School and see if he could strike up a conversation.

Nanhai County was the attached county of Guangzhou, and the scale of the county school in this "First City of the South" was something Lingao County couldn't compare to. Even the Qiongzhou Prefectural School was not as large. Not only was it magnificent in scale, but it was also well-maintained, completely different from the desolation of the Lingao County School back then, where grass grew knee-deep. Back then, because the stipends couldn't be paid monthly, the scholars rarely visited throughout the year.

Scholars came and went, the sound of reading aloud filled the lecture halls, and the servants were humble and polite. *This is the real "Great Ming,"* Huang Binkun lamented as he wandered around. *If all the prefectures and counties in the world were like Guangzhou, how could the Cropped-Hair Bandits have succeeded? At best, they would be like the Portuguese, occupying a small island to do some business.*
