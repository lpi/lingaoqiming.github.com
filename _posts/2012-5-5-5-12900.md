Wu Zhixiang stepped off the gangplank and stretched. The recent days of travel by sedan chair and boat had left him quite fatigued. After passing through Jiangxi, he had switched to a boat, heading towards Nanjing.

Although traveling by boat was a bit more comfortable than by sedan chair, to make good time, they had used small boats for the entire journey. Even though the Qiwei Escort Agency's boats, regardless of size, were arranged to be as comfortable as possible, being cooped up in a cabin day after day was truly stifling. Having finally arrived at the Hangzhou docks today, he insisted on taking a break to recover his spirits and enjoy a few days in this "paradise on earth."

Wu Zhixiang had rushed from Guangzhou to the Jiangnan region under the instructions of his father and elder brother to "build connections." He originally didn't want to leave his comfortable life in Guangzhou for the long journey to Jiangnan, but his future prospects were at stake. Although he had obtained a Xiucai degree through his family's connections and had spent several years in Guangzhou living the life of a dissolute young master, he had grown tired of it over time and now wished to advance his official career. The Donglin Party currently held great power both in and out of the court. If he wanted to climb higher in the official hierarchy, he had to find a way to get on good terms with the Donglin Party members. The Donglin officials had always been keen on promoting "young talents."

Jiangnan was the sphere of influence of the Donglin Party. Many of the party's past key figures, including several of the seven gentlemen persecuted to death by Wei Zhongxian, were from Nan-Zhili and Zhejiang. Many scholars who had not yet entered officialdom and retired Donglin officials also gathered here.

As long as he could find a way to befriend these people and gain their support, it would be of great help to him in passing the provincial examinations and starting his official career.

For this purpose, he brought with him a large number of gifts: half were various local products from Guangdong, and the other half were various foreign goods, most of which were novel "Australian goods." He had obtained these goods by pulling strings and going through Pei Lixiu's channels. Many were rare items that were currently in short supply on the Guangzhou market. If it weren't for Wu Zhixiang's past service of tipping them off, which had been a great help to the Zizhihao, he probably wouldn't have been able to get so many at once.

Due to a long gap of more than half a year, Australian goods were like a long-awaited rain after a drought in the market; they were swept up as soon as they appeared. Small items like glass mirrors, glassware, Australian trinkets, and cosmetics, which used to be easily available for a price, now required pre-orders.

Although Wu Zhixiang was a dandy, he was the son of an official family, and through osmosis, unless he was a completely uncultured and arrogant "second-generation heir," he was far smarter in worldly affairs than ordinary people. Although his father and brother had been officials for many years and had amassed considerable wealth, they were not powerful "big shots," not even comparable to the "great gentry" in the countryside. To succeed in the imperial examinations was not something that could be achieved by simply visiting a few "seniors" and offering some silver.

Cheating in the examinations was a high-risk affair in any dynasty. Once exposed, it would lead to a major legal case. Yet, cheating was rampant in every dynasty. The high risk made cheating more covert, and thus the system was even more shrouded in darkness.

Without the right person to make an introduction, even if he wanted to offer money, there was nowhere to send it, or it would simply be wasted.

The Wu family was not from Jiangnan and had few connections they could use there. How to find the right person to help him build bridges became a major problem for Wu Zhixiang.

At the side of Gongchen Bridge, sedan chairs from the Qiwei Escort Agency were already waiting. Wu Zhixiang's entire journey from Guangzhou to Hangzhou was arranged by Qiwei. Although he had no relatives or old friends in Hangzhou, Qiwei had already used its connections to rent a small guest courtyard in a monastery by the West Lake for him. The arrangements were very thoughtful.

Wu Zhixiang got into the sedan chair and headed towards the city.

Wu Zhixiang's arrival was immediately reported to Zhao Yingong's desk through Qiwei's channels. Due to his actions during last year's anti-encirclement campaign, Wu Zhixiang had been placed on the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's "observation list."

Those on the "observation list" were mostly Ming gentry and wealthy individuals who were friendly to the transmigrator group and had some utilization value. They were not yet "collaborators" with close ties of interest like Li Luoyou or Gao Ju, but they showed a friendly attitude towards the "Australians" in many aspects and were willing to cooperate with the Yuanen Senate.

Among the group of dandies who frequented the Ziming Lounge, Wu Zhixiang was the most "pro-transmigrator." Coupled with his "resolute" performance during the anti-encirclement campaign, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau considered further utilizing his identity and social connections.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau secretly investigated his background in Guangzhou. The Wu Zhixiang family was from Wuzhou, Guangxi. They were originally landlords who also engaged in industry and commerce, and were very wealthy. The official positions of his father and brother were not prominent; they were typical mid-level bureaucrats. They had also amassed a large amount of wealth during their several external appointments.

Because this family was engaged in industry and commerce and had long been active in Guangzhou, their horizons were much broader than those of ordinary local squires. It was only natural for them to be "pro-transmigrator" in their political attitude.

Jiang Shan felt that the Wu family's connections could be used. Therefore, as soon as he received the news of Wu Zhixiang's trip to Nanjing to lobby the Donglin Party, he sent it to Hangzhou.

Jiang Shan did not require Zhao Yingong to explicitly help Wu Zhixiang, only informing him of the opportunity. Whether he utilized this opportunity and how he did so was up to the intelligence officer himself.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau did not specify how its agents should operate. Except for rare cases where specific tasks were assigned, it only provided a general work outline for its foreign-stationed intelligence officers. The specific details were generally not restricted, provided they did not compromise the safety of the station itself or the overall interests.

"Should I help this young master?" In his study, Zhao Yingong looked at the daily report from the Qiwei Escort Agency. This person had come to seek fame and fortune. With the current strength of the Hangzhou station, helping someone pull strings to cheat in the imperial examinations was beyond their capabilities. It could even backfire and get them into trouble. It was better not to get involved.

With this in mind, he decided to only have someone keep an eye on him for now and decide on the next step based on his local activities. Having made up his mind, Zhao Yingong marked the file with the word "Observe" in pencil and placed it in the file basket. At noon, Fenghua would come to collect these files, categorize them, and then arrange for field personnel to handle them through Sun Wangcai.

Zhao Yingong casually picked up another thick file folder. This one was from the Taoist priest. Zhang Yingchen had rarely met with him recently. The "smear campaign" personally planned by the priest had officially begun. Now, both the priest and Zhao Yingong had gained a small bit of fame locally.

The Chinese Vulgate version of the Old Testament, brought from Lin'gao, had arrived in Hangzhou a few days ago. The book was hand-copied by naturalized citizen scribes—because the Grand Library, the Religious Affairs Office, and the Lin'gao Church had no plans to disseminate this book. Zhang Yingchen was hiding in his Taoist temple at night, secretly flipping through it and copying "ammunition," doing the same kind of work that Bo Yang once did.

Ever since Zhang Yingchen had "concocted a great medicine" for a certain gentleman, his fame had grown even more illustrious. Zhao Yingong had never figured out what the priest had used to fool that gentleman—the transmigrators' medical and chemical stockpiles certainly didn't contain things like Viagra, Indian God Oil, or Spanish Fly. He had always kept it a secret. Anyway, since then, Daoquanzi's fame had skyrocketed. Wealthy gentry and large households flocked to invite him. Zhang Yingchen accepted every request, frequently visiting the homes of the gentry. However, he still insisted on practicing medicine and dispensing remedies at his temple every week—which further enhanced his reputation.

Opening the file folder, Zhao Yingong casually flipped through it. It turned out that the folder contained the "black materials" compiled by Daoquanzi. In the accompanying letter, Zhang Yingchen requested the Hangzhou station to print a batch of pamphlets to be used as posters to attack the Hangzhou church.

The transmigrator group had used this kind of black material propaganda, such as posters, more than once. Back in Guangzhou, they had launched a major psychological warfare campaign, distributing various pamphlets with remarkable results. Therefore, Daoquanzi was now following the same method.

Zhao Yingong had received recent news: Huang Zhen had returned from Ningbo, looking like he was ready for a decisive battle. It seemed he had definitely received the support of the great monk Yuanwu from Tiantong Temple. Zhang Tian, a key figure in the Hangzhou religious case, was also active on all fronts. It seemed the Hangzhou religious case was about to erupt.

Seeing Zhang Yingchen's enthusiastic mood, Zhao Yingong couldn't help but worry. Although this move of throwing dirty water to trigger the religious case in advance served a dual purpose, if it went too far and the Hangzhou church suffered a heavy blow, he was afraid they would have neither the ability nor the will to help him when the time came.

With this worry in mind, he quickly processed all the official documents and letters that had been delivered to the safe house the previous day. He locked the confidential materials in the safe and directly threw those that needed to be destroyed into a brazier, watching them turn to ash—he never entrusted these tasks to Fenghua, even though she had been trained and certified by the General Political Security Bureau.

Leaving the safe house, Zhao Yingong returned to his inner study where he conducted his business. Mei Lin was waiting for him there.

His face was covered in dust, and the net covering his wig-bun was gray and grimy. He looked like a member of the laboring masses.

After several months in Jiangnan, Mei Lin found that he hadn't lived the life of luxury he had imagined. His long-awaited trip to Nanjing had passed in a flash. Forget the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai, he hadn't even had time to look at a decent woman. Apart from that trip to Nanjing, he had been at the construction site, directing the building and renovation work. Not only was he responsible for the construction, but the interior decoration and furnishings were also all under his management. It was impossible to ship every piece of furniture and decoration from Lin'gao over a thousand li. Most had to be purchased or custom-made locally in Hangzhou. The tasks of drawing up plans and instructing the craftsmen all fell on his shoulders. Because there was so much work and the requirements were very complex, custom orders from outside were never quite satisfactory. Mei Lin eventually asked Zhao Yingong to recruit various artisans and set up his own woodworking factory on the grounds of Phoenix Mountain Manor, specializing in the production of furniture, interior decorations, and architectural components.
