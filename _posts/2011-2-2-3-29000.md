Two or three professional escorts from the Qiwei Agency were brought in to serve as guards. Like the grain store clerks, they were only responsible for their professional duties and were not involved in intelligence work. Qiwei was, after all, still a joint venture. Although the Transmigration Group had effective financial and managerial control, its employees came from the old society and had not undergone the Group's "purification" process. Their reliability was considered a notch lower.

However, the men from the escort agency were professional enough. They were more than adequate for security work. Lin Baiguang had always believed that intelligence personnel should rely on their brains and eyes, not their fists.

Gao Di was quick-witted and articulate, so Lin Baiguang made him the grain store's "external manager," the equivalent of a modern business development manager. Chen Tong, being honest and reliable, was appointed "internal manager."

As for Lin Baiguang himself, he was the "owner." His cover was a merchant from Guangzhou who had come here to open a grain store. All the necessary documents were prepared by the Guangzhou station.

To fit his status, and with the approval of the Executive Committee, he was assigned two "maids." These two young women were also graduates of the intelligence training program. Their other mission was to serve as radio operators and cryptographers.

"These are your staff, not your 'personal assistants,' you know," Hu Qingbai joked to Lin Baiguang while processing the transfer paperwork.

"Do you think I'd do something so pathetic?" Lin Baiguang scoffed. *Don't assume every man sees his reproductive needs as paramount.*

Hu Qingbai, however, missed his point and said, shaking his head, "Logically, as a merchant, it's strange for you not to have a wife..."

"You're wrong about that," Lin Baiguang said. "The folks in the Grand Library's historical materials group say that in ancient times, shopkeepers and owners never brought their families with them. Even the biggest bosses left their wives in their hometowns and only went back every few years."

"If I were that rich, I wouldn't want to live like a widower. What's the point of making money if not to enjoy it..."

Lin Baiguang didn't take the bait. In his view, Hu Qingbai didn't understand that a career was a man's greatest source of excitement. What was the pleasure derived from women? Just a fleeting moment of joy.

After completing the paperwork, he went to the Political Security General Directorate to handle the transition. Now that he was the chief of an intelligence station, he was organizationally no longer under the Internal Affairs Committee but under the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee. He had to temporarily resign from his post as head of the Enemy Labor Department to avoid neglecting his duties. He also had to attend a small ceremony.

In the directorate's conference room, the entire staff was present, all in neat uniforms with their service belts. The Political Security General Directorate wore the Year One naval uniform, but with blue collar tabs.

"...To all departments: In recognition of Comrade Lin Baiguang's immense contributions to our work with enemy personnel, and to commend his exemplary deeds, a special commendation is hereby issued... Chairman of the Congress of Transmigrators Executive Committee: Wen Desi. November 1629."

After Ran Yao finished reading the commendation, Lin Baiguang gave a formal salute and accepted it with both hands. The room erupted in enthusiastic applause. A personal commendation from the Chairman was a first for the entire directorate, but given Lin Baiguang's achievements, it was well-deserved.

"It's a pity we don't have medals. The 'First-Class Merit,' 'Second-Class Merit' system is too simplistic. I'd be embarrassed to award it to a local, let alone you. So I applied for a Chairman's Commendation instead," Ran Yao said apologetically.

After the ceremony, Ran Yao and Lin Baiguang had a private conversation in his office to discuss the handover of the Enemy Labor Department. Lin Baiguang requested to take some of the work with him to the intelligence station, including intelligence-gathering trips to Guangdong and the search for the families of Lin Dan and Xu Cheng, in order to continue recruiting the remnants of Zhu Cailao's forces.

"You can take that part of the work," Ran Yao said. "I'll coordinate with the Intelligence Committee and give you a separate radio call sign. You can continue to report directly to the Political Security General Directorate and request assistance."

"Thank you so much," Lin Baiguang said. He then briefed Ran Yao on the morale and potential issues among the recruited remnants of Zhu Cailao's forces. Although this was no longer his responsibility, he had good personal relationships with these men and a great deal of firsthand knowledge of their state of mind. Since he would be away from Lin'gao for a while, he needed to provide a thorough handover so someone could take over.

He then requested a person. This person was considered a "political prisoner." Although he was doing hard labor in the labor camp, Duguo Qiuhun, who was in charge of security and penal affairs, had no authority over him—he couldn't be released without the approval of the Political Security General Directorate.

"Oh? Who do you want?"

"He Xin."

"That wimp?" Ran Yao was very surprised. He knew of He Xin. Although he was a pirate, he was a typical dandy, a coward who had risen through the ranks thanks to a woman's connections. He had no particular skills to speak of.

"He Xin is useless here in Lin'gao. He's probably not even fit for hard labor. But in my hands, he will be very useful," Lin Baiguang said.

"Alright, he's yours," Ran Yao agreed.

Lin Baiguang had taken an interest in He Xin based on information he'd gathered from casual chats with Shi Shisi and the others.

"When it comes to He Xin, he's a master of eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, and all the refined pleasures. He's perfect material for a hanger-on," Shi Shisi had said, laughing. "He's great at keeping the bosses entertained. But the moment a battle starts, he wets his pants. He's terrified of the sound of cannons and won't even stay in the command ship—even the Chief has to fight in person sometimes. He Xin spends all his time hiding in the supply train."

He Xin was originally the young master of a fish merchant in Fujian. After his parents died, he had no interest in the family business. Within a few years, he had squandered his entire inheritance on debauchery. With nowhere else to go, he sought refuge with his female cousin.

With his glib tongue and expertise in pleasure-seeking, he had managed to carve out a small niche for himself in Zhu Cailao's group, essentially acting as a professional guest and hanger-on for the pirate leaders.

*If this man is the material of a hanger-on, he's useful to me.* Lin Baiguang's grand ambition was to penetrate deep into Ming society. Of course, this didn't mean integrating with the common folk, but rather connecting with the rich merchants and officials of this era. Lin Baiguang was confident in his own social skills, but he wasn't yet familiar with the specific forms of corruption and entertainment of this time. Since He Xin was an expert in all forms of debauchery, he would be a great help.

He subtly probed for more information about He Xin. Shi Shisi and the others didn't particularly dislike this "pretty boy." Although he was a hanger-on who had gotten ahead through a woman, he wasn't a malicious or cunning person.

*If he's not a cunning person, that makes things easier.* Lin Baiguang thought, *As long as his heart isn't bad, it's worth the effort to win him over.*

He had the release papers drawn up. Lin Baiguang instructed Gao Di, who had accompanied him back to Lin'gao, to prepare a private room at the Bopu detention camp, complete with clothes and personal items.

He himself took the public ox-cart to the Nanbao labor camp.

Since the opening of the mines in Nanbao, the labor camp, originally at the Bairen quarry, had been relocated. It was no longer appropriate to have it so close to the Transmigration Group's central hub. Furthermore, blasting for stone in a densely populated and built-up area like Bairen Beach was unsafe.

Lin Baiguang crossed a drawbridge over a deep trench. The bottom of the trench was filled with fire-hardened bamboo spikes. Beyond the trench was a barbed-wire fence surrounding two or three dozen long, brick-and-wood barracks. Wooden watchtowers stood at the perimeter.

In the open space in the middle of the compound stood a chilling wooden platform with strange racks and iron shackles. Lin Baiguang knew without asking that it was a torture device. No wonder the locals paled at the mention of this place; "human rights" were clearly not a priority here.

Hearing that a "chief" had arrived, Fu Youdi came running out to greet him.

"I want He Xin. Bring him out immediately. I'm taking him with me."

Fu Youdi looked troubled. "Chief! This man is a 'life-term' serious offender. Apart from the sick, all the serious offenders are at the quarry right now. How about when they finish work this evening, I'll have him sent to you..."

"I'm taking him now," Lin Baiguang said.

"Then I'm afraid you'll have to come with me to the quarry."

The labor camp's quarry was at the foot of a small hill not far from the camp, reserved exclusively for the prisoners. It had watchtowers and a perimeter of armed guards. Three or four hundred prisoners were on the hillside, gathering and transporting stone fragments from the blasting. For hygiene and easy identification, their hair and beards were completely shaved off. They worked almost naked, with only scraps of cloth on their bodies, not for modesty, but to protect themselves from being scraped by the rocks.

Each group of prisoners was supervised by a foreman-like figure, who had colored flags with numbers stuck in his belt and carried a rattan whip.

The scene reminded Lin Baiguang of a movie, *Spartacus*. Wasn't this just naked slave labor?

"Are there female prisoners here?"

"No, women are a rare commodity in Lin'gao. How could we let them be wasted here?" Fu Youdi said. The female prisoners had a separate work site where they spun thread, processed cotton, and tanned hides. Nanbao was the trading window to the Li districts, and kapok, cotton, rattan, hemp, and leather flowed out continuously. The Ministry of Light Industry had set up a primary processing plant here, using prisoner labor.

"Bring me prisoner 16280505130080," Fu Youdi ordered. One of his men immediately went down to the worksite. A short while later, he returned with a filthy, stark-naked prisoner.

"Are you He Xin?" Lin Baiguang sized him up. Apart from his dark, rough skin, he looked healthy enough, not tortured into an inhuman state as one might imagine. His face was just covered in dust and grime.
