Zhuo Yifan returned to the courtyard and closed the door.

He smiled and bowed to the assembled company. "Everyone, thank you for your hard work on the journey." He bowed deeply.

Since Guangzhou, these dozen or so people had maintained the facade of a wealthy family. It was one thing for Zhuo Yifan to play the "master," but for the others, many of whom were renowned figures in the martial arts world, to play the part of "servants," to be ordered about and to genuinely serve, was no small feat.

"We have come to a dragon's den for a mission of life and death. A little hardship is nothing," said the "steward," shaking his head. "I only hope that we can succeed in one fell swoop and not betray the trust of our superiors!"

"We are here to serve the court and relieve the suffering of the common people," added another man dressed as a servant. "We are willing to risk our lives, so this little hardship is nothing. Young Master Zhuo, you need not be so polite."

These two "servants" were the most senior and held the highest status in the courtyard. With their declaration, the others could only murmur in agreement.

Zhuo Yifan bowed again. He then turned to the "steward." "I must trouble you with the housing arrangements, Uncle Wan."

The "steward," Wan Lifeng, also known as the "Wind-Chasing Sword," had been a bodyguard in his youth and was well-versed in the ways of wealthy families on the road. This was a return to his old profession. He nodded. "Do not worry, leave it to me."

Zhuo Yifan walked to the veranda, where several men and women were already standing. A glance told him that only the disciples of the Hengshan Sect remained in the main room.

The Hengshan Sect was composed entirely of women, and their style was somewhat "unconventional." Zhuo Yifan had seen much of it on their journey.

He stood at the door, not entering. It was a room full of women, and he wished to avoid any suspicion. He spoke through the fine bamboo curtain:

"Abbess, the attendant has left."

"Is that you, Young Master Zhuo? Please come in."

"Yes."

Zhuo Yifan lifted the bamboo curtain and entered.

The "old woman" sat in the center, flanked by her female disciples. Though the room was cool, beads of sweat dripped from the old woman's face. She held a towel, dabbing at her forehead, her demeanor no longer as "dignified" as before.

The one disguised as the "old woman" was none other than Abbess Miejing of the Hengshan Sect. The maids beside her were mostly young disciples of her sect.

Though the abbess had been treated with respect on the journey, it had not been easy. To conceal her identity as a nun, she had to wear a heavy wig at all times, except when she slept. After Guangzhou, the weather had grown hotter each day. The heavy, stuffy wig was an unpleasant burden.

"Young Master Zhuo, please sit."

"Yes, thank you, Abbess." Zhuo Yifan's attitude was deferential—the superiors of the Hengshan Sect were known for their eccentric tempers.

"Is everything settled outside?"

"The luggage has been delivered, and everyone's quarters have been arranged," Zhuo Yifan reported. "You and the other disciples of your sect will stay in this main house. I will have the luggage brought in shortly. I will also inform the attendant that you are observing a vegetarian diet and have them prepare a high-quality vegetarian meal."

Miejing's face was a mask of indifference. Hearing that he had made the arrangements without issue, she nodded. "You have gone to a great deal of trouble."

"Not at all, Abbess. You are my elder. This is my duty. I will go out tonight to contact Seventh Master and the others. I will report back to you tomorrow when I have news."

Miejing nodded. "Go. I hear the 髡's agents are formidable, like the Imperial Guard, and there are many scoundrels from the martial arts world among them. You must be careful."

"Yes, I know. Please do not worry, Abbess."

Miejing nodded slightly and said no more.

Zhuo Yifan returned to the courtyard. Wan Lifeng had already arranged the housing. Besides the Hengshan Sect disciples, the other women also stayed in the small courtyard. The men all lived in the large one.

As for the luggage, there wasn't much. Besides personal clothing and bedding, there were only swords and other weapons, all hidden in boxes.

The large and small official boxes that had filled the carriages were mostly filled with bricks and rubble, a mere deception. Though they were fake, Wan Lifeng didn't dare leave them outside, fearing the attendants would grow suspicious. He painstakingly moved them all into the side rooms.

After a busy period of settling in, Abbess Miejing sent two disciples with the fruit and a large jar of sour plum soup, delivered by the attendant, to the large courtyard for everyone to cool down.

The group was sweaty from moving the boxes. With these refreshments, they dispensed with decorum, each finding a spot in the shade to eat and drink.

Zhuo Yifan was the leader. Though young, his position was not low. The stone table and chairs under the grape arbor were reserved for him and the other leaders of the group: Wan Lifeng, Sha Guangtian, and Meng Bofei.

These three were all influential figures in the martial arts world. Zhuo Yifan knew their involvement was not solely due to the prestige of his master, the White Stone Daoist, or the grand cause of "serving the court and relieving the suffering of the people."

He only knew that the mastermind behind this operation was "Shi Weng." Who this Shi Weng was, he had no idea. But to mobilize so many martial arts heroes, he must be a person of immense power in both the court and the common world.

"What is our next step?"

"We wait for the right opportunity," Zhuo Yifan said. "This is the heart of the 髡's territory. Do not act rashly. I will first contact Mr. Sima, and then we will discuss other matters. Uncle Wan—you will continue to play the role of the steward. Though we are behind closed doors, we must maintain the proper etiquette. We must not reveal any flaws. If an attendant sees something and reports it, it will ruin everything. Naturally, some of our comrades will have to endure some grievances..."

"Yes, I understand," Wan Lifeng nodded. "We have all been in the martial arts world for many years. We understand this."

"We must put on a good show, but not overdo it. We are, after all, a family of scholars and officials. We cannot act like nouveau riche."

The others chuckled. Zhuo Yifan then said to Sha and Meng, "You two uncles will continue to act as guards. Keep a close watch on the gate, guard it during the day, and post sentries at night. Especially at the Abbess's place, we must prevent any strangers from entering—it is easy for her to be exposed there."

A knowing smile appeared on their faces. In Lingao, there was no need for the Abbess to continue suffering with the wig. But if someone were to see her, it would immediately become a major news story.

"Unless necessary, do not leave the inn. Do not even go out of the courtyard gate. As for gathering information and exploring the area, we will discuss it after I meet with Sima—after all, they arrived half a month earlier."

The three of them nodded in unison. As they were talking, the doorbell rang loudly. Everyone jumped to their feet. Zhuo Yifan quickly waved his hand, signaling Wan Lifeng to answer the door.

The others in the courtyard quickly gathered the fruit and tea cups and hid in their rooms. Sha and Meng stood at attention under the eaves.

When the courtyard door opened, it was Li Xiaoliu, holding a thick stack of papers. He smiled obsequiously before speaking. He was here to inform them about the household registration tomorrow.

"...This is the household registration form. Since the young master and the old mistress will be staying in Lingao for a long time, you must register for a temporary household. This is a government rule, so please bear with us." Li Xiaoliu bowed. "Tomorrow, the household registration police from the East Gate Market police station will come here to verify and register everyone. Please stay in the inn and do not go out, so as not to miss the official business and cause inconvenience later."

Zhuo Yifan thought to himself that these 髡's were quite arrogant. A mere public servant had such a grand air, daring to tell a wealthy family like them to "wait for verification." He wondered how they usually oppressed the common people. He was quite disdainful.

As expected, Wan Lifeng frowned. "Filling out the household registration form is one thing. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. But for a mere public servant to make our young master and old mistress 'wait,' that's too much..."

The attendant quickly said, "Steward! You cannot say that. According to the chiefs' rules, you must go to the police station to register. Our inn's young master went to great lengths to get them to come to the inn for verification. This is already a special exception. You all saw what happened to that family earlier—who knows how that will end."

"What's the background of that policewoman? How can she be so fierce?"

"That one? She's a security police officer from the East Gate Market police station, named Lian Nishang. She's the most shrewish of them all." The attendant said with a grin, "She's a good person, but don't get any 'improper' ideas about her."

"So they're really going to make their womenfolk parade on the street and wait in line?" Wan Lifeng wanted to get more information out of him and led him on. "It's just a matter of spending a little money."

"It's hard to say!" the attendant shook his head. "Spending money is out of the question. It all depends on whether our owner can persuade the police station to be lenient. In my opinion, it's unlikely!"

"Are the laws in Lingao so strict?"

"Yes, so I'm also reminding you all: this place is not like the Great Ming. Don't break the Australians' rules."

"Thank you, little brother." Wan Lifeng took out a circulation coupon from his pocket and slipped it to him. "Take this for tea."

"Thank you for the reward, steward." Li Xiaoliu smiled and bowed again. He then asked about the dinner arrangements and whether they needed to arrange for a carriage or rickshaw to go sightseeing in East Gate Market.

"For dinner, just arrange the first-class standard according to the guest register. Our old mistress is a vegetarian, so prepare a vegetarian meal. As for the carriage, we do not need it for now. We are tired from the journey and wish to rest early. Please prepare more hot water for the evening."

"Yes, I understand." Li Xiaoliu smiled. "As for hot water, our inn has a supply in the evening. You can just turn on the tap and use it at any time."
