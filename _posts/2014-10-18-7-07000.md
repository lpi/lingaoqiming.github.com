Before entering the city this time, he had estimated that if the officials did not surrender and committed suicide, their families would probably all commit suicide and die with them—in this time and space, there was no such thing as preferential treatment for prisoners of war and good treatment for women and children. Once defeated and captured, it was common for men to be beheaded and women to be sold into prostitution. Unless the victor was willing to show mercy, which was very rare.

This time, someone from Prefect Dong's family actually didn't die, which was very strange. He couldn't help but ask again, "What's going on?"

"She was originally going to die for her honor, but for some reason she hesitated for a while. By the time she was about to hang herself, the heavenly soldiers had already arrived—so she was saved," Wei Bifu said. "Your humble subject thinks that her will to die was not strong."

"That's not surprising. Even ants cling to life."

"Yes," Wei Bifu said with his head bowed. "Does Your Excellency want to call her for questioning?"

"No need," Liu Xiang shook his head. "You just lead the way."

Beside the flower hall, there was another side courtyard, which was the residence of the master secretary. Wei Bifu said that the master secretary's whereabouts were currently unknown, and he had probably hidden himself.

Behind the flower hall was the place where the prefect lived his daily life. It was no different from an ordinary large household. There was also a small garden in the backyard, slightly decorated with springs and rocks for relaxation.

Liu Xiang saw that the furniture in the hall was in a mess, and all kinds of clothes and valuables were scattered on the ground. A rosewood tea tray had fallen to the ground, and several cups were smashed to pieces... One can imagine the fear, chaos, and despair that Prefect Dong's family had experienced before he committed suicide by taking poison. Liu Xiang sighed with emotion.

Wei Bifu carefully accompanied "Master Liu" to inspect. He saw the soldiers of the Fubo Army who had rushed in early in the morning standing guard at every doorway and step, all standing straight without looking askance. Even though all kinds of valuables and gold and pearls were scattered on the ground in front of them, they were not moved. He was secretly surprised in his heart—if it were anyone else, the back residence would probably have long been a scene of fighting each other for property, and the property would probably have been robbed to the point where not even a teacup was left!

The ones who were collecting the property were another group of fake 髡. They were in groups of three. One person carried a small wooden box and a sack on his back to transport the property; one person held a ledger and a dip pen, with an ink bottle hanging around his neck, specializing in registration and bookkeeping. The other person was responsible for picking up things, and every time he picked up something, he had to hold it up and shout.

"One kingfisher feather and silver hairpin!"

"One half-new blue makeup and satin vest!"

"One piece of broken silver, weight unknown!"

"One string of copper coins, over a hundred! Not counted!"

...

Such shouts rose and fell in the hall. There were also special people to supervise. Wei Bifu thought to himself: it was said in the past that the 髡贼 were as meticulous as a hair and valued money as much as their lives. Seeing it today, it is indeed so!

However, he did not dare to show this thought. He just bowed his head and waited for instructions. At this time, a native cadre ran over, stood in front of Liu Xiang, bowed and said, "Chief!"

Liu Xiang knew that they were from the special search team of the Planning Institute. The private property of the prefect alone in the yamen was probably not small, and they could make a good fortune again. He smiled and said, "No need for formalities. How long have you been here? Have you inventoried the prefectural treasury?"

"Three hours," the cadre said crisply. "Most of the front has already been searched. The prefectural treasury will be inventoried tomorrow. The back residence is today's focus and needs to be carefully inspected."

"The harvest is not small, right?"

The cadre was a little embarrassed, "To be honest, the harvest is not much. No large amounts of silver were found in either the master secretary's residence or here. There are quite a few valuables. Next, we are preparing to dig for hidden treasures."

"Oh, are there any clues?"

"Yes, although many of Prefect Dong's family members have run away, his housekeeper and long-term followers have been caught. After they are all interrogated, we will be able to find them—at worst, we also have a set of methods. We will never let the silver grow moldy underground."

"Good. It must be done as soon as possible. Clean up the house so that we can receive guests. I'm still waiting to use this place."

"Yes, chief. We will definitely do it as soon as possible."

Liu Xiang roughly looked around the prefectural yamen. He saw that there were many houses here, and the buildings were tall and cool. The conditions were much better than those of the Wuyang Posthouse, so he decided to temporarily set up the Guangzhou municipal government here. Although according to the plan, the Senate was preparing to build a "new Guangzhou city" on Henan Island and the administrative center would also be located in the new urban area, their main work at the moment still had to be carried out in this old urban area.

Instead of having to enter and leave the city every time to handle affairs, it would be more convenient to open the yamen and handle affairs directly here.

Liu Xiang had actually also considered the Guangdong Provincial Administration Commission yamen, but he thought that it would be better to leave it for [Wen Zong][y002]'s Guangdong Grand Area organ to use. Anyway, as the mayor of Guangzhou, besides the prefectural yamen, he also had the yamen of Nanhai and Panyu counties to use. Moreover, Guangzhou was the provincial capital of a province. The yamen and government offices on the east and west sides of Chengxuan Avenue were as numerous as ox hair, and there were also many large temples in the city. The transitional housing was very sufficient, so there was no need to rush to grab houses.

So he decided to set up the Guangzhou Military Control Commission in the Guangzhou Prefectural Yamen. He immediately instructed the surrendered officials and their families who were living in the prefectural yamen to move out as soon as possible to vacate the houses.

According to the reception plan, all the surrendered people and their families and property in the city would be settled in the Guangdong Imperial Examination Hall on Dashi Street at the foot of Yuexiu Mountain. The Imperial Examination Hall was large and had many houses, enough to accommodate the surrendered and captured Ming officials. The more important officials and their families were sent to the Guangxiao Temple for screening. All the surrendered generals and soldiers were sent to Hong Kong Island for reorganization.

Liu Xiang turned around and saw that the flower hall had been tidied up. He immediately instructed to receive the surrendered people of Guangzhou's one prefecture and two counties in the flower hall. Led by Wei Bifu, the vice-prefect of Guangzhou, there were county magistrates, chief clerks, registrars, instructors, river inspectors, patrol inspectors... all kinds of officials, both in and out of the stream, and the clerks and heads of the three shifts and six rooms of the two county-level yamen... they stood densely in the courtyard, but there was not even a sound of coughing.

Liu Xiang instructed Wei Bifu to call the roll, and the surrendered people came up one by one to pay their respects. Liu Xiang asked a few questions and then dismissed them. This was not him putting on airs, but to get a general understanding of the situation of the surrendered people and see if they could be used. What disappointed him slightly was that not only had the prefect committed suicide, but the county magistrates of both Nanhai and Panyu counties had also committed suicide. Almost all who surrendered were subordinate officials.

Subordinate officials were far inferior in terms of appeal. The Ming Dynasty did not necessarily have the "support of the people," but it was a fact that the "hearts of the officials were with the Ming." It would have been great if the Foreign Intelligence Bureau could have persuaded a few local high officials to surrender this time. It would have a great effect on the subsequent pacification by proclamation. After all, only high officials had the effect of a weather vane.

However, the whereabouts of the officials of other yamen were no longer within Liu Xiang's scope of authority. His calculations could only be made within the territory of Guangzhou Prefecture—it would be great if there were genuine officials in the other prefectures and counties under Guangzhou Prefecture who could "join the light."

At present, Wei Bifu seemed to be a good person. Although he didn't know his true ability, at least he was active enough in the matter of "leading the way." He could temporarily ask him to help with things.

After receiving the surrendered people, Wei Bifu came out of the ranks and reported, "Your humble subjects and others have prepared gifts to welcome the holy envoy to express our sincerity. We implore the Senate and Master Liu to accept them with a smile."

The surrendered people presented ten thousand taels of silver, as well as many precious items, such as agarwood, jade belts, red gold jewelry, and jade pots. At a rough glance, they were also worth tens of thousands of taels of silver.

The gifts were divided into two parts. The larger part was presented to the Senate, and the smaller part was naturally a gift to Liu Xiang.

Liu Xiang said, "The various items presented by Wei Bifu and others show your loyalty. I will accept the ones presented to the Senate. As for the ones given to me personally, I will not take any of them. You can take them back with you." Wei Bifu and the other surrendered people quickly knelt on the ground and repeatedly pleaded, "If Your Excellency does not accept a single item, your humble subjects and others will be very uneasy. We hope that you will deign to accept a little!" Seeing that their words were sincere, Liu Xiang ordered his secretary to accept a jade pot and return all the rest.

Liu Xiang then "admonished" them a few more words, which were nothing more than telling them "not to have any burdens," "to study hard, accept transformation, and strive to serve the Senate and the people as soon as possible"...

After speaking, he instructed the surrendered people to disperse, leaving only Wei Bifu and a few old clerks from the former Guangzhou Prefectural and Nanhai and Panyu county yamen. He asked about the local conditions of Guangzhou.

Liu Xiang called the personnel of the Planning Institute to inventory all the property and register it, and even handed over the jade pot he had received to the public. The few surrendered people who saw this were secretly surprised: it was said that the Australians were greedy for money, and they were really calculating, but their elders were all as incorruptible as water. I really don't know what they are thinking!

Then he casually chatted with the surrendered people about the basic situation of Guangzhou.

He was most concerned about the population. The population was not only a labor force but also a consumer market. Guangzhou was not like Qiongshan—the urban population of Qiongshan had not exceeded 40,000 so far—Guangzhou was a mega-city in the 17th century. Just feeding the non-agricultural population was a major issue. Especially now that Guangdong had not yet been completely occupied, the food supply from Guangxi would also be interrupted for a considerable period of time. It was necessary to find out how many non-agricultural people there were, and what the self-sufficiency rate of local necessities such as grain, firewood, and cloth was, so as to organize an effective trade supply channel and avoid a crisis caused by insufficient supply.

However, the feedback he received was not satisfactory. The population statistics he could get were still the numbers on the yellow registers stored in the prefectural and county yamen—Liu Xiang had long seen the accuracy of the yellow register numbers in Qiongshan.

According to the yellow registers and the estimates of the household registration clerks, Nanhai County had 38,000 households, Panyu County was slightly less, and Guangzhou City had a total of about 60,000 households, with a population of about 200,000. The real data was probably a little more. And the population of the entire Guangzhou Prefecture was about between 500,000 and 600,000.

Liu Xiang began to go crazy. Although the yellow registers detailed the various names of military households, artisan households, and strongman households, these household registration classifications were actually meaningless in the late Ming Dynasty. Military households did not necessarily serve as soldiers, and artisan households were not necessarily artisans. It would take a great deal of imagination to count the number of non-agricultural people from them.

"We still have to conduct a census," Liu Xiang wrote this down in his notebook to himself.

After talking for a while, when he was free, his native secretary, Guo Xu'er, came in and said in a low voice, "Chief, Miss Dong wants to see you."
