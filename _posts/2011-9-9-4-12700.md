Wang Wu lay behind the cover of the earthwork. The camp had been built according to the platoon-level independent camp standards in the "Manual of Military Engineering Standards" compiled by the General Staff, but now he had only a squad's worth of men to defend it. In fact, after sending out the corporal and leaving Liu Bin in the tent to care for the sick, there were only 10 defenders left.

Ten men could not hold off the several hundred thugs outside. Wang Wu looked at the sparse figures on the earthworks. If the enemy attacked from multiple directions, each side would only have two or three men to defend. They could hold out for an hour or two at most. Their only hope lay with the messenger. If Danzhou could just send a company, they would be saved!

"We have to hold out here. The longer we hold, the better our chances of survival," Wang Wu said, pulling a cigarette from his pocket and lighting it. "The more noise we make here, the sooner the work team headquarters will notice something is wrong and send reinforcements. We have rifles. What do those bandits outside have?"

The sergeant nodded and continued to rally the men. "I fought in the Lingao bandit suppression campaign. Bandits are just a bunch of lazy good-for-nothings. They're best at bullying the common people. In a fight, if you stand firm, they'll turn tail! We just have to hold out for a day!"

The sergeant and Wang Wu climbed the watchtower together. In the woods and tall grass beyond the camp's clearing, the glint of blades and spears could be seen among the shadowy figures. From the village came a cacophony of cries and chaos.

"There aren't actually that many of them," the sergeant said. "If we concentrate all our men, we can break out..."

But that would mean abandoning all the sick. And the road out was a rough mountain path. If the bandits had set an ambush there, they would be in for a tough fight.

Wang Wu shook his head. "We can't abandon the sick. They'll all die. And... we might not be able to break out anyway."

A rash breakout attempt would, at best, allow three or four to escape. A total wipeout was a result neither the work team nor the sergeant could explain to their superiors.

"We have to hold on."

They climbed down from the watchtower. Just then, Liu Bin came to find Wang Wu, crying. Three of the sick, including the medic, had already died. The condition of the others was not optimistic.

"I gave them anti-diarrhea medicine and painkillers," Liu Bin said through her tears, "but it's still not working."

Wang Wu said, "They've been poisoned. We don't know what kind of poison it is, so medicine is useless..." Just then, the lookout on the watchtower shouted a warning: the bandits were forming up.

"To your positions!" the sergeant yelled. "Don't panic! Let them get close before you fire!"

Liu Bin wanted to go to the earthworks, but Wang Wu refused. "You'd better take care of the sick."

There were now two men on each side of the camp, and two in the watchtower, for a total of ten. There were no reserves. Everyone knew they would either have to repel the enemy on their own or die here.

Wang Wu and a soldier with mild symptoms defended the western section. Listening to the groans of pain from nearby, Wang Wu loaded five or six rifles and placed them within reach. Following a method he had seen in military training films, he placed a rifle in several of the fortified positions along his section.

The bandits on the east side of the camp cautiously approached. The sergeant climbed the watchtower himself. He saw that only the enemy on the east was advancing; the others were holding their positions. He knew this was a probing attack.

"Attention! The enemy is coming from the east! Twenty archers! Thirty miscellaneous troops! No firearms."

This group of bandits advanced a hundred paces, and when they were about two hundred paces from the earthworks, a single shot rang out.

The whistle of the bullet through the air made everyone duck. A bandit cried out and fell.

Then, as if many people were firing, puffs of white smoke rose continuously from the earthworks. The bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, turned and fled in disarray.

Wang Wu, in his position on the western earthwork, had resisted the urge to look at the situation on the east. He knew the enemy on his side was also slowly advancing, and he was afraid that if his attention was diverted, the bandits would take the opportunity to attack.

Sure enough, the sergeant's voice soon rang out again. "The enemy on the west is charging! Ten archers, fifty miscellaneous troops, with firearms..."

In an instant, Wang Wu saw dozens of men dressed like ragged peasants, brandishing various weapons, rush out from the woods and tall grass, letting out strange cries. He immediately raised his rifle and fired into the crowd.

The recoil had barely faded from his shoulder when he dropped the rifle and ran along the trench to the next position, picked up the rifle there, and fired again. Then the next position. He then returned in the same rhythm, firing six shots from three positions in a matter of moments.

The soldier helping him reload did so with lightning speed. He smelled a foul odor on him.

"Sorry, I couldn't hold it," the soldier said with a pained expression, handing him a Minie rifle with an unknown yellow substance on the stock.

Wang Wu had no time for such things and continued to shoulder and fire.

The bandits quickly retreated. They then launched attacks on the other two sides, both of which were repelled. The soldiers in the watchtower fired as fast as they could, creating the illusion of very dense enemy fire.

When the first round of fighting ended, seventeen or eighteen bodies lay in the open ground, and many more bandits were wounded. The result was quite satisfactory.

Wang Wu thought: if the bandits keep attacking at this pace, holding out for a day won't be a problem.

The bandit leaders could no longer maintain their earlier smugness.

"Didn't you say they were all poisoned? They don't look poisoned at all!" Hu Lanyan was very displeased at the loss of his men. The bandits who had trickled in now numbered over 300, but if they kept fighting like this, what would be the result besides a senseless loss of life?

"Dammit, was Liu Dazhu telling the truth or not?" Gou Xunli couldn't think of any reason for Liu Dazhu to lie. But from the looks of it, the enemy seemed to have many men.

Xin Nari said, "Should we just retreat?" He was terrified of the Australians and wanted to stay as far away from them as possible. Xin Nari was superior to the others in one respect—he was well aware of the huge gap between himself and the Australians.

"This is an easy target. We might not get another chance like this."

"We can't retreat! If we retreat, how will we survive in the future? We must crush the bandits' spirit!"

"We should attack from all four sides at once. That way, they won't know which way to turn."

As they were talking, someone reported that they had captured a "short-haired bandit" on the mountain road.

"Excellent!" Gou Xunli's spirits lifted. "Quick, bring him here!"

Wang Wu was on lookout—he had let the sick soldier who was reloading go to change his pants and rest. The fighting would resume soon. Just then, the sergeant came over with another soldier. "Captain! Someone is coming from the east!"

He had a soldier temporarily take Wang Wu's place, and the two of them ran to the eastern earthwork. Looking out from their cover, they saw several bandits pushing a bound man forward.

Their hearts sank. The man was covered in blood, but the clothes he wore were the uniform of the Fubo Army.

"We've captured your messenger. You don't have many men left!" a bandit shouted from behind. "Surrender now! No one is coming to save you!"

The capture of their messenger meant that headquarters would only realize something was wrong when no one showed up for the routine weekly report two days later.

"If you don't surrender, this will be your fate!" the bandit shouted, raising a long spear.

On the tip of the spear was Liu Dazhu's head, his eyes slightly open, his mouth agape, as if in defiance.

Wang Wu trembled, a chill rising from his feet. He felt his own death was near. In a hoarse voice, he shouted back, "We will not surrender! You bunch of savages! You bumpkins!"

The bandits on the other side roared with anger, and with one stroke, they cut off the corporal's head. The rifle in the watchtower fired at the same time, and the bandit who had wielded the sword had half his head blown off. The others turned and fled in terror, even abandoning Liu Dazhu's head. Three or four more shots rang out, felling two more bandits.

Half an hour later, with a shout, the bandits began a new charge, carrying various objects. They were carrying door panels taken from the village, hastily made ladders, and many bundles of firewood—this was a formal assault.

The attack came from all four sides at once, but the sergeant in the watchtower quickly identified the main thrusts as coming from the south and east.

"Concentrate fire on the south and east!" the sergeant shouted. "Watch your sights!"

The bandits quickly entered firing range. The leaders behind them yelled and drove them forward. The sound of gunfire became dense, and puffs of smoke enveloped the earthworks. The soldiers were no longer aiming, just firing blindly. The loaders reloaded as fast as they could.

The sergeant fired from the watchtower while observing the situation. Because there were many men in this charge, the loss of a few was not obvious, and the bandits' courage grew. They soon reached the trench and began throwing bundles of firewood and earth into it. Taking advantage of this brief pause, the sergeant roared, "Quick, reinforcements to the east!"

Two of the four men on the west and north sides immediately ran to the east. Including the men in the watchtower, several men fired continuously, one after another.

"Take cover!" the sergeant noticed many of the bandits suddenly look up at the same time.

A shower of arrows rained down on the earthworks and into the camp, thudding into the ground. A soldier who was reloading couldn't take cover in time and was pierced by an arrow. He grunted and was gone.

Wang Wu had no time to mourn the loss. The sergeant's whistle blew again. "Quick, to the west!"
