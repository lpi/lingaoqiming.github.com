The blue cloth robe wrapped around the woman's body slipped to the ground, revealing only a small dudou underneath. Lin Baiguang, who had been abstinent for a long time, could no longer hold back. He immediately took out a small plastic-sealed packet from his pocket and tore it open with a "hiss"... The tent was suddenly filled with a vibrant spring atmosphere.

After eating and drinking his fill, Lin Baiguang, slightly drunk, embraced the naked Xiaoshu and got into bed. He took out a cigarette from his pocket, carefully put it in his mouth, lit it with an oil lamp, and took a comfortable puff, preparing for another big battle later.

Based on Lin Baiguang's experience in brothels in another time and space, he knew that this woman was quite clean. He had to seize this opportunity. Of course, he still had to use a condom—thanks to his foresight, he had brought several with him.

Just as he was considering what position to try next and what other tricks to play, he heard the woman in his arms sobbing. Lin Baiguang exhaled a puff of smoke and asked with great concern, "What's wrong? Why are you crying?"

"It's nothing, I'm just lamenting my bitter fate."

Lin Baiguang thought this plot was very familiar, but her bitter fate was caused by the pirates, and he also had a share in it, so he vaguely agreed a few times.

"Where are you from, sir?" Xiaoshu snuggled in his arms, looking like a small bird relying on a person. "I feel that you are from the Zhangzhou-Quanzhou area..."

Lin Baiguang thought this was quite right. His ancestors had lived in Taiwan for more than a hundred years, so he could be considered half a Minnanese.

"Not at all, I'm an Australian," Lin Baiguang said. "My ancestors did cross the sea from Minnan."

"Then we can be considered half-countrymen."

"It can be considered meeting an old friend in a foreign land," Lin Baiguang said with a smile, but he became vigilant in his heart.

Sure enough, Xiaoshu said to him in a voice that was almost inaudible, "I have something to ask of you."

"Hmm, what is it?"

"Softer!"

Xiaoshu pressed Lin Baiguang's lips with her finger, pointed to her ear, and made a gesture of "walls have ears."

Lin Baiguang lit his cigarette and ignored her reminder: "Tell me."

"Can you take me away?"

"Away?" Lin Baiguang couldn't help but lower his voice.

"Yes."

"..." Lin Baiguang was suddenly faced with such a situation and was a little at a loss. What was Xiaoshu thinking? Was there any trickery in this?

"Please, sir, take me away. If this goes on, I will be ruined by them sooner or later." Seeing his expression change, Xiaoshu lay on his chest and begged in a low voice, crying.

"Don't cry," Lin Baiguang comforted her softly. "What is it..."

"I was originally from Zhangzhou Prefecture..."

Xiaoshu said that she was captured by pirates last month and had been locked up in the old camp, exclusively for the pleasure of the big leaders.

"...More than a dozen people took turns to ravage my body. If I disobeyed even a little, I would be beaten. It was truly a life worse than death," Xiaoshu sobbed softly.

"I see."

Lin Baiguang replied softly. He thought that there were probably people eavesdropping outside the tent.

"I only ask that you have mercy, sir, and take me out of this bandit's den. My family in Zhangzhou also has some money, and they will definitely reward you heavily."

"Since your family has money, why didn't they come to ransom you?"

"We couldn't agree on a price," Xiaoshu said sadly. "They want a large sum of money, which can only be raised by selling our house and land..."

"You'd rather lose your life than your money."

"It's just my bitter fate. Please have mercy on me and let me go." Xiaoshu stopped crying and whispered, "Before I came, I heard them discussing that you probably came to Nanri Island with ulterior motives. They want the big boss to cut you in two."

"..."

Xiaoshu kept persuading him: "The big boss is a very suspicious person. He won't believe you." She whispered, "Are you here to gather information? I have secretly found out the number of men, ships, cannons, and grain of the great shopkeeper Zhu." As if afraid that he would not believe her, she whispered, "Seven large ships of two thousand liao—"

"I'm not a spy, I don't want to know this," Lin Baiguang said softly. He had already completely determined that Xiaoshu was lying—this was a woman used to test him.

"If you want to leave this place and go home, I will see the great shopkeeper Zhu tomorrow and naturally plead for you and ask for you. Even if it costs a few ransoms, we Australians can afford it. At that time, I will naturally send you home. As for the reward, not a single penny. But—" his words were very serious, "you actually secretly investigated the great shopkeeper Zhu's troops, horses, money, and grain. This is a great act of treason. I think you should not do such a stupid thing. I will not tell Shi Shisi and the others what you said. You should resign yourself to your fate, otherwise your life will be in danger!"

Lin Baiguang spoke cold and ruthless words. But in his heart, he really wanted to say that this clumsy performance should end. Although the actor's performance was not bad, the script was too bad.

"Spare my life, sir!" Xiaoshu sobbed and was about to get off the bed to kneel.

"Don't worry, I'll pretend I didn't hear these words. But you have to be honest."

Lin Baiguang stubbed out his cigarette, turned over and pressed the woman under him, forcing her into a kneeling and prostrate position. He triumphantly slapped Xiaoshu's buttocks hard twice and once again forced her to cooperate.

That night, Lin Baiguang vented several times. Knowing that the woman under him was actually a spy, he lost even the last bit of pity for her. It was not until he was exhausted that he fell into a deep sleep.

While Lin Baiguang was sleeping soundly after three hundred rounds of battle, the central army tent was brightly lit. Zhu Cailao and his leaders were discussing the situation and also assessing the reliability of the Australians as allies.

Everyone felt that what Lin Baiguang said should be reliable. Now, having such an ally was of great benefit, not to mention that the other party had already promised to supply vital materials such as firearms and grain, which was urgently needed by the gang in dire straits.

The next step was whether to launch an attack on Min'an. The leaders had different opinions, but they all felt that they could not continue to be in a stalemate on Nanri Island. They had to do a big job to supplement the scarce food and pay.

The old camp's general manager, Wang You, frowned and said, "Big boss! The brothers' food and pay are really scarce, and even eating is a problem."

Zhu Cailao's face was not good. Food had become a heartache for him. Originally, pirates never had to worry about food. There were as many rich and powerful merchants on the shore who were connected to the sea as there were hairs on an ox. As long as they were willing to pay the price, they would risk their lives to transport grain to help. However, now they could not count on them at all—the Zhangzhou-Quanzhou area of Fujian was all Zheng Zhilong's territory. Now he had an official hat on his head, and no one among the big households connected to the sea dared to offend him. Zhu Cailao's only means of collecting grain was robbery. Robbing grain and fodder seemed to cost no money, but now the cost was far higher than buying grain. The shore was full of stockades and local braves. Although most of the official army was just playing soy sauce, Zheng Zhilong was very protective of his territory and would almost certainly come out whenever there was an alarm. This made it necessary to dispatch a large number of ships and men every time they went out to collect grain, which was somewhat not worth the loss.

"How much surplus grain is there?"

"If we use it sparingly, it can last for about ten days," Wang Qing reported. "The pay can be delayed for a while, but the matter of grain cannot be delayed for a single day."

A commotion broke out among the leaders.

"Big boss, this is not a solution. We should go back to Guangdong."

Guangdong was Zhu Cailao's home base, and it was much easier to get food and supplies by returning there.

"Go back? Easy to say! Will that little brat Liu Laoxiang let us pass? He'd rather we rot here in Fujian."

"At worst, we'll fight him. It's not certain who will win or lose."

"That's right! He may not be our match!"

...

Zhu Cailao snorted:

"Go back? Go back for what, to drink the northwest wind?" He slammed his palm on the table. "The foreign goods business in Guangzhou is all the business of the Franks. We can't get a foot in. If we want to make money, we have to stay here!"

"Besides, if we fight a battle with Liu Laoxiang, won't the 髡贼 (kūnzéi) in Lingao benefit in the end!" Zhu Cailao sneered. "This group of overseas barbarians is probably just waiting for me and Liu Xiang to start fighting so they can pick up the pieces."

"Big boss, they are willing to supply us with grain and firearms..."

"Do you think this grain and firearms are easy to get? We have to send our own ships to transport them. If I return to Guangdong with my entire team, how can Liu Xiang let me return safely?"

"F*ck your mother! There's still this way!" A leader had already started cursing. "Kill that unlucky boy!"

"Forget it, they are now considered to be in an alliance with us. We will have to rely on them for our cannons and fast guns in the future." Zhu Cailao waved his hand. "But for now, to expect their help is like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger."

"That's not necessarily true," Wang Qing said.

"Oh? What's your brilliant idea, General Manager Wang?"

"The whole gang can't go back to Guangdong. Why don't we send some ships to Lingao first and ask them to supply a batch of grain and firearms."

"No, no, Liu Xiang won't even let a large group of ships pass. If there are dozens of ships, won't he catch them all and swallow them in one bite!"

"Liu Xiang doesn't have clairvoyance or clairaudience. He must have spies here. He will get the news as soon as our ships move." Wang Qing seemed to have a plan in mind. "But we won't take the inner sea, we'll take the outer sea. Even if he knows, the sea is vast, where can he find us?"

"If we take the outer sea, the small boats can't go." The wind and waves on the outer sea are big, and there are no landmarks. The small boats that make up the bulk of the pirate fleet are not suitable for sailing.

"Since we are going to load goods, it's useless to send small boats. They can't carry much. Naturally, we have to send large ships."

But if the large ships went, the combat power at sea would inevitably decline. This was another dilemma. After the meeting, it was decided to first send a team of large ships to Lingao to transport grain back. After the ships returned and the morale was slightly boosted, they would launch an attack on Min'an.

When he woke up the next day, it was already morning. Lin Baiguang didn't have a watch, but from the light and shadow outside, it was probably close to ten o'clock.

When he woke up, he felt relaxed and refreshed. Looking beside him, Xiaoshu was already gone. Only the long hair on the pillow reminded him of the beautiful scenery of last night, and he couldn't help but feel a little sad.

"Brother, you're up?" Shi Shisi came in from outside with a smile, followed by a young pirate carrying a basin of water for washing his face.

"I'm up late, I've made a fool of myself in front of Brother Shi."

"Hehe, you were too fierce last night!" Shi Shisi said with an ambiguous smile. "How about it? Xiaoshu is not bad, right?"

"Good, very good."

"This fair-skinned little bitch—" Shi Shisi said with an envious tone. "Alas, let's not talk about it. The big boss wants to see you in a while."

After washing up, Lin Baiguang was led by Shi Shisi to Zhu Cailao's central army tent again. But this time, he was received in the rear tent.

There was no one else in the tent, only Zhu Cailao sitting on a chair, with many map scrolls piled on the table.

"Sit." Compared to yesterday, Zhu Cailao's attitude was much milder.

"Did you sleep well last night?"

"Thanks to the great shopkeeper, it was very sweet." Lin Baiguang stood up and bowed. "I also have to thank the great shopkeeper for his great love."

Zhu Cailao nodded and got straight to the point: "Are you also willing to sell the repeating fast guns you use?" The description of the SKS rifle by the pirates who had escaped back had left a deep impression on Zhu Cailao.

When he said this, it was obvious that he had already recognized the agreement between the two sides. Lin Baiguang felt a little excited. He reminded himself to stay calm:

"Of course we can sell them, but—"

"The price is negotiable! If the loan is used up, I will buy them with cash."

"It's not the price. This is a steel gun." Of course, Lin Baiguang could not say that Lingao could not produce SKS for a while, nor could it mass-produce bullets.

"The body of the gun is made of the best hundred-refined steel. Even if our blacksmiths in Lingao don't eat or drink, they can't make many in a month."

"I want a hundred of them." Zhu Cailao was not vague. "The price can be doubled. How soon can you have them?"

"Well," Lin Baiguang said with feigned difficulty, "three months, I guess."

"Too late." He was a little regretful. "Can you sell the old repeating guns?"

There are only a few hundred SKSs. If we sell them to you, can we still live? Lin Baiguang thought and said with a smile, "This is difficult. You also know, old sir, that we have few people and few ships. We can get by in Lingao, besides relying on the great shopkeeper not to bother with us, it is these few fast guns. If the great shopkeeper wants to buy guns, if you give us a few more months, we will naturally have them."

Zhu Cailao stared at Lin Baiguang for a long time before saying, "It's strange. It takes two months to buy a cannon, and three months to buy a few guns. What do you have that is ready-made? Is it just an empty document?"

Lin Baiguang was frightened by his eyes—the power of this great sea merchant was really not a joke. What is the aura of a king? This is the f*cking aura of a king. The people's commissars in our Executive Committee who pretend to be profound and talk about theories all day long are simply heaven and earth.

Lin Baiguang lowered his eyebrows and waited. He only answered after he spoke:

"Great Shopkeeper Zhu, please understand! Weapons are not something that can be had just by saying so. They are all things that consume labor and materials," Lin Baiguang said carefully. "As for the other things, they are all ready-made."

"Is the grain also ready-made?"

"Yes." Lin Baiguang had expected that what he was most interested in besides arms was grain.

"What about gunpowder?"

"We have it."

"Tomorrow I will send a fleet to Lingao to buy goods," Zhu Cailao said as if nothing had happened. "Does Shopkeeper Lin want to go back with the ship?"

Lin Baiguang answered without hesitation, "It's better for me to stay here. The business is not done yet. I can also be a witness here."

He came here to instigate a rebellion. What would it be if he just went back like this? Wouldn't all his efforts be in vain?

He continued, "There is no problem for the great shopkeeper to send ships to transport grain. There is still enough grain in Lingao now. I will write a letter back right away."

"Good, I will send a large ship right away," Zhu Cailao said with a smile. "Before the ship comes back, please stay here for a few more days, Shopkeeper Lin."

"I've troubled you a lot."

Zhu Cailao nodded and asked about some of Lin Baiguang's personal affairs. He smiled and said nothing about Lin Baiguang's claim to be an Australian. He talked to Lin Baiguang about the Kaiyuan Temple and Luoyang Bridge in Quanzhou, and about the salty rice and qiancao cake of Quanzhou... Some of them he had heard of in the past, and some he had not. Lin Baiguang had no choice but to say what he knew and what he didn't know, and then said that his ancestral home was only in Minnan, and he had never been clear about the situation in his hometown. Then Zhu Cailao talked about his past of doing business along the coast of Fujian when he was young.

When Zhu Cailao talked about these things, he was both cordial and amiable, as if he were a retired old neighbor who was unwilling to be lonely and was looking for someone to chat with. Lin Baiguang suddenly became alert: he was trying to find out his background.

This old and cunning fellow. Lin Baiguang realized this and felt that his situation was extremely dangerous. At this time, he felt that his principle of "telling the truth as much as possible, and only telling lies at critical moments" was completely correct. You can't fool a shrewd person—if there is any inconsistency, I'm afraid this old pirate will turn hostile!

The intimate chat lasted for about an hour. Lin Baiguang used all his skills from dealing with the county leaders in the past to cope with it. No matter how awesome Zhu Cailao was, Lin Baiguang didn't think he could be stronger than the county party committee leaders he had served.

He was not asked to stay for lunch. He was sent back to his tent with great warmth.

Lin Baiguang returned to his tent. He looked at the calendar he carried with him. There were not many days left before Zhu Cailao's attack on Min'an. There was one thing he hadn't figured out. Zhu Cailao was in a hurry to go to Lingao to transport grain, which obviously meant that the supply had reached a very difficult point. If so, would he wait until the grain was transported back before launching the attack?

From all indications, this was very likely.

Lingao could naturally provide enough grain to fill twelve large ships, but in this way, when Min'an was defeated, all this grain would be a cheap gift to Zheng Zhilong—and it was still unknown how many men and ships he could pull out from Zhu Cailao's hands. If he gave more than ten ships of rice to Zhu Cailao for nothing, and in the end, he just escaped from the chaotic army alone, wouldn't this be a huge joke? He would never be able to make a comeback in the transmigrator group.

Lin Baiguang made up his mind: he absolutely could not give the grain. Zhu Cailao could not hold out on Nanri for a few more days. As long as he held out for a few days, he would have to take a risk and act.

The only way was to use the "delay" tactic to detain the grain transport fleet in Lingao. In this way, even if his 策反 (cèfǎn - instigate rebellion) failed, at least in the end, the transmigrator group could obtain twelve large sea ships and hundreds of men.

But in this way, his own situation would be much more dangerous. Lin Baiguang could not predict Zhu Cailao's attitude after he did not get the grain. It might be possible to delay for a few days, but if it dragged on for a long time, not to mention that his own life would be in danger, it was also unknown whether the angry and ashamed Zhu Cailao would not attack Min'an, but simply launch a full-scale attack on Lingao.
