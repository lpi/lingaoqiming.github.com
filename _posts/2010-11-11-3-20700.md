By mixing in 50% sand, it was already possible to completely make them lose control. Then, by disrupting the organization and distributing them evenly, we could achieve a situation where "I am in you, and you are in me," completely messing up the factions within.

"The sailors will have to go through a 60-day quarantine period anyway. Our political department will seize this time to carry out educational work and try to win over the sailors as much as possible."

"How is the education of the people brought by Ren Fu going?"

"Considerable progress has been made." Wei Aiwen's face lit up. "They belong to Zhu Cailao's central army system and are considered trusted subordinates. It was difficult at first, but we seized on the contradiction between the officers and soldiers—"

Wei Aiwen said that in the entire ideological education work, the focus was on the "grievance" movement. Whose grievances were they to complain about? The first was naturally the corrupt officials and evil gentry, who oppressed the people and made their lives miserable, forcing them to take this path. As for the second, it was the sea lords. It was necessary to focus on exposing and criticizing the various acts of oppression of the masses within the pirate gangs, so that the sailors could fully realize that the sea lords and leaders were not their benefactors, but the bad elements who exploited and enslaved them...

"Stop, stop..." [Wen Desi][y002] hurriedly stopped him. "I understand this line of thinking, to drive a wedge between the two sides. But these leaders will be appointed in the future, not directly taken out and shot. If we make the relationship too confrontational, how can we carry out our work in the future? Won't the sailors have to denounce these people as soon as they get on board?"

"Of course, there will be a sense of proportion," Wei Aiwen said. "It won't be intensified, it's just to let them see the true face. Besides, we also have study courses for these pirate leaders."

"You're going to hold a study class?"

"Yes, a study class."

Shi Shisi and the others stayed at the merchant's hall and were treated to good food and drink. From the second day on, it was a continuous series of visits.

"Visits, constantly organize them to visit, so that they can fully appreciate the strength of our group and the superiority of our system!" Wei Aiwen instructed. "Facts speak louder than words."

The first was a visit to the Fengcheng ship. Personally boarding this huge iron wheel made this group of sea dogs as curious as children. They had just taken a few steps on the deck when they all rushed to the bulwarks to look down.

"So high!"

Some people didn't believe it was made of iron. They touched it with their hands, knocked and scratched it with the copper coins they had with them, and some even licked it. Seeing the newly installed giant cast-iron cannon on the deck, these people's eyes went straight. This was a 150mm muzzle-loading rifled cannon, the same as the one on the Bopu beacon tower. The slide rails for transporting ammunition next to the gun position, the shells, and the crane used for loading the shells all aroused their endless interest.

What interested them most was the sliding track under the gun position. Without much effort, two or three people could make the cannon rotate. They all had experience in naval warfare and knew the power of being able to adjust the direction of the cannon at will. They couldn't help but click their tongues in wonder.

"Damn it, with this thing, Zheng Zhilong is nothing." Shi Shisi couldn't hold back his excitement. "Even the big clippers of the red-haired people in Macau are no match for it."

Then, they visited the Bopu Commune and the shipyard. The completed part of the first iron-hulled ship, Project 854, which had been in a semi-shutdown state due to material supply problems, still became the best display of construction achievements.

Shi Shisi and the others personally walked into the dock, stroking the rows of iron ribs as thick as small tree trunks, and the iron plates nailed to the ribs with huge rivets, with a look of complete disbelief.

Fearing that it was not enough, Wei Aiwen played a promotional film for them for several consecutive days. For the sake of solemnity, the Japanese secret film was not shown, but a promotional film edited from various resources was shown.

On the moving screen, steel splashed in the iron and steel complex, the hydropower station spewed huge water dragons, giant steel ships slowly slid into the sea from the slipway, looms continuously spewed out cloth and silk, the city's brilliant lights and endless traffic, the ruddy-faced modern farmers, driving Dongfanghong tractors...

Then there were rows of Imperial Stormtroopers in white helmets and white armor marching, and then the camera turned, and it was replaced by the armored phalanx in the National Day parade...

The leaders lost their ability to distinguish in the darkness. This greatly surpassed their understanding of the world. When the lights came on, Lin Baiguang was satisfied to see that they were all dumbfounded.

"Everyone, this is the place we came from!" Lin Baiguang said with great spirit.

A few people tried to squeeze out a smile from their faces, and some showed ecstatic expressions in their daze. The former seemed to be more in line with the trend, while the latter had the potential for speculation. The intelligence personnel responsible for observing their expressions wrote down their intuitive comments under each person's photo.

After three days of visits and study, according to the results of Wu Fo's eavesdropping on their private conversations, the leaders were completely prostrate before the transmigrator group. Pirates worshiped the strong, and almost everyone in their conversations believed that they had come to the right place by defecting to Lingao this time. Some were even more ambitious, thinking that perhaps the Australians would even enter the Central Plains and replace the Zhu emperor, and everyone could be a founding father.

Under this sentiment, it became much easier to deal with the fleet as necessary. After letting them rest and relax for a few days, Wu De took the lead and held a special meeting to announce the policy to the defecting leaders.

All the defecting leaders, regardless of how many boats they brought, would each receive a set of independent housing. This kind of housing was designed by the Lingao Construction Company for the gradually increasing number of native management cadres in the future, and it was also an experiment for the individual housing after the collective dormitory system of the transmigrator group was abolished in the future.

This kind of cadre housing adopted the idea of a terraced house to save land and building materials. Each small building had a two-and-a-half-story structure with a practical area of 240 square meters. It was equipped with running water and a simple squatting-pit flush toilet, but no electricity. All houses also had a small front and back yard.

Their personal property would be protected and could be disposed of freely.

The family members and children of the leaders would all live ashore. Minor children would go to school, and adult children would go to school or participate in work according to the family's request and their own wishes.

Private servants were not recognized locally, so the servants brought by the leaders would all have their status abolished. Those who were willing to continue to serve the leaders would be treated as an employment relationship. Those who were not willing would be treated as immigrants.

As for the sailors they brought, those who wished to go home or go elsewhere would be given severance pay. Those who were willing to stay would be gathered for a 90-day quarantine.

"After the quarantine is over, those who are willing to come back as sailors will be re-enlisted on the ships; those who are not willing will be uniformly arranged for other work by us," Wei Aiwen explained the policy.

The people below began to feel uneasy. Servants were easy to deal with, as there were not many of them in the first place. Many of the sailors were peasants who had been forcibly conscripted. If they were free to come and go, wouldn't a lot of them run away at once? After this catastrophe, they had already lost a lot of people. If they did this again, wouldn't they have no one to command?

Then Wei Aiwen continued to announce: "Now everyone's ships, some have more people, some have fewer. It's barely enough for sailing, but if we want to fight, it's probably not enough. So the navy will set a quota for each ship and fill up the vacancies. In the future, the pay will be issued according to the roster after each ship is staffed."

"In the future, everyone's food and pay will be issued by the navy, so you don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt. Hahahaha." Wei Aiwen laughed.

Shi Shisi and the others could not laugh. They naturally knew the twists and turns here. After reorganizing the personnel, a large amount of "sand" would inevitably be mixed in, and the original tight small groups formed by regional and kinship ties would be completely diluted. Even if there were still some familiar faces on their own ships, they were no longer the trusted subordinates they could command at will.

As for the unified logistics, it sounded like a good thing, but in reality, whoever paid the army was the one whose army it was. Once the pay and grain were all issued by the Australians, the brothers on the ships would not be very loyal to them. Once the two channels of grain and pay were controlled, they could only obediently follow the command of the Australians.

How could everyone not know the stakes involved, but these conditions were open and aboveboard, and could even be considered generous. Not to mention that they now had no people and no grain, and once they objected, it would prove that they had "two hearts." Everyone knew what the consequences would be for someone who had just changed sides.

After a few days of visits and study, they had a direct understanding of the strength of the Australians. They not only had enough awe, but their ambitions and expectations also grew—seeing the strength of the transmigrator group, they dared not say that they could fight all the way to Beijing and become emperor, but it was probably possible to carve out a corner in the southeast and establish a government. At that time, they would be the founding fathers, with the blessing of ennobling their wives and sons!

It was better to show loyalty now—anyway, the transmigrator group could crush their little strength with a wave of their hand. Since they were going to sell themselves into service, they might as well sell themselves completely. Thinking of this, Shi Shisi was the first to stand up:

"Since I have come to defect to Lingao, I am willing to offer all my subordinates and ships! I only ask to be a vanguard general, to charge into the enemy's lines for you leaders!"

Everyone was dumbfounded. Li Guangfa followed and stood up: "I am also willing to offer my ships and men. From now on, I will be of one mind with the leaders, and we will be in the same boat."

"I am also willing. I have had enough of drifting on the sea!" Fatty Hu also shouted.

In this way, the rest of the people who were not very willing had to agree in unison.

Wei Aiwen put on the air of a leader and pressed his hands down: "Since everyone has come to Lingao, we are one family. Since we are one family, there is no need to argue about whose it is."

He continued: "Your ships will still be under your own command. If you don't want to drift on the sea anymore, the Executive Committee also has a policy."

According to the policy set by the Executive Committee: anyone who was willing to hand over their ships would have their ships purchased by the Executive Committee. Those who were willing to continue to work at sea after handing over their ships would be assigned to work in the Navy Department. Those who were not willing to continue to go to sea would be assigned to other places.
