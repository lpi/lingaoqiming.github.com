"The choice of weapon," Xi Yazhou began, "depends on our environment and our enemies." He paused, organizing his thoughts. "We face three main opponents: Han Chinese armed forces, a mix of infantry with simple firearms and cold weapons, represented by the Ming army and roving bandits like Li Zicheng; the Manchu Qing army, primarily cavalry with a small number of firearms; and the various Chinese and foreign pirates who plague the coast, who mainly use firearms.

"We are few, and most of us have no combat experience. We may not have the psychological fortitude of the ancients. Therefore, our weapons must meet two criteria:

"First, a sufficiently long range, to suppress enemy charges and strike their artillery and commanders. The field guns of the Napoleonic era had an effective range of only 900 meters. The 17th century was even less advanced, maybe 400 meters at most. Our rifles must have at least that range.

"Second, our first two opponents will use cavalry as a shock force. Our weapons must be able to project a large volume of fire to suppress a cavalry charge. Machine guns would be ideal, but that seems impossible."

"So why not the SKS? It has a 400-meter effective range, a 10-round magazine, and a rate of fire of 40 rounds per minute. It's not outstanding, but it's simple, and most of us have handled one before."

"I don't like the 7.62x39mm M43 cartridge," Xi Yazhou said with a chuckle. "It uses a corrosive primer, which is hard on the barrel and requires frequent cleaning. The environment in Hainan is harsh. Most of our people have no military experience. They'll let their guns rust into a solid block.

"Corrosive primers are also hard on the cartridge case, which will make reloading difficult. And reloading will be our only source of ammunition in the early stages.

"The Warsaw Pact weapons are designed to be 'good enough.' They prioritize cost over durability. In our situation, we need weapons that will last. The SKS, and weapons like the AK, have a short service life. And the SKS is a standard semi-automatic rifle. It cannot be converted into an automatic rifle."

A murmur went through the room. They understood. Semi-automatic rifles based on military automatic rifles, like the civilian AK/AR, could be converted to full-auto. The FBI had no jurisdiction in the Ming Dynasty.

AK-47, M-16... the names flew around the room, everyone picturing themselves as a cinematic action hero.

"Then let's buy a large number of civilian AKs!" Shi Niaoren said, caught up in the excitement. "They've been on the market since 2004. With our mechanical capabilities, converting them is no problem."

"Why an AK? I want an M-16!"

"That's an AR-15, you idiot."

"If you convert it, it's an M-16, isn't it?"

"I still don't like the M43 cartridge," Xi Yazhou said, satisfied with the effect of his words. "And I don't recommend small-caliber rifles like the M-16. It's not just about stopping power, but also about power at maximum range. And small-caliber ammunition is more difficult to produce. I recommend a semi-automatic rifle that uses the 7.62mm NATO round, like the civilian versions of the M-14 and FN-FAL. If we convert them to full-auto, we won't have an urgent need for machine guns."

"M-14? I hear the accuracy is good, but the power is excessive, and it's heavy."

"Isn't that gun a bit complicated? American guns are always so complex."

The firearms debate raged for half an hour. Shi Niaoren, bored, suggested they talk to Little Rui online. He was more familiar with the US gun market.

Little Rui proposed a rifle no one had heard of: the Saiga-308, a Russian-made civilian semi-automatic that used the 7.62mm NATO round. An AK that could fire the American empire's full-power rifle cartridge was a rare beast.

The Saiga-308 was a sport and hunting rifle developed by the Izhevsk factory, the main manufacturer of Kalashnikov firearms. It retained the look and feel of the AK, with parts from the AKM and AK-74. It had good accuracy, high reliability, and a special buffer pad to absorb the recoil of the powerful NATO round.

"It has good performance, sufficient power, and a long effective range," Shi Niaoren relayed. "The empty gun weighs 3.6kg. It comes with an 8-round magazine, but can also be equipped with a 20-round magazine and a drum magazine. The price is $500, with a discount for bulk purchases. The M1A—the civilian M-14—is much more expensive, over $1000."

"So Little Rui is suggesting the Saiga-308?"

"He didn't say that," Shi Niaoren, a shrewd workplace survivor, said. "It's just a suggestion. The final decision is up to the Executive Committee."

The ball was back in their court. The discussion continued, with no clear consensus. The members of the Sports Group, except for Xi Yazhou, were uninterested. The Type 56 carbine was good enough for them.

"Are bolt-action rifles not an option?" [Chief Wen][y002] asked. He had a secret fondness for antique rifles, for the image of soldiers in black high hats and red and yellow wool uniforms, marching in slow, disciplined ranks.

The 7.62 NATO versus 7.62 Warsaw Pact debate ended in a stalemate. Six different plans were proposed:

1.  SKS semi-automatic.
2.  M1A (M-14) semi-automatic.
3.  Saiga-308.
4.  Civilian semi-automatic AK-47/74 or M-16, to be converted to full-auto.
5.  A mix of high-power long-range rifles and intermediate-power or small-caliber rifles.
6.  Bolt-action rifles.

As the discussion grew heated, [Wen Desi][y002] shifted the topic to personal self-defense weapons.

The Sports Group had originally planned to issue daggers, but with the North American Branch's offer, they could afford to be more extravagant. Handguns were popular in the US civilian market, but for the sake of simplicity, they could only choose one model.

There was no objection to the 9mm Parabellum round. Most favored the M9, thanks to its cool factor and its association with the heroic image of Brother Mark. The M1911 had its supporters, but it was heavier. The PPK, S&W revolvers, and Glocks all had their fans.

The Executive Committee had originally intended to choose the S&W 9mm revolver. It was simple and durable, though it had all the disadvantages of a revolver: gas leakage, short range, low ammunition capacity, and slow reloading.

But the Sports Group disliked the revolver. The PLA had no tradition of using them, and they weren't confident in its performance. And it just wasn't cool enough. In the end, they compromised. Both the M9 and the S&W M337 were included in the procurement list.
