The harbor, once a scene of pristine, subtropical tranquility, was now a hive of chaotic, spectacular activity. Small boats zipped back and forth, a constant shuttle between ship and shore. The derricks on the ships swung through the air, a rhythmic dance of cargo and steel. A steady stream of people, a human river, flowed from the gangway of the massive freighter. The beach was a patchwork of colored signs, a makeshift city of landing sites, cargo dumps, and registration desks.

The entire operation was centered around the Bopu Inspection Office and the beacon tower that loomed behind it. It was not an ideal location for a port, but the existing buildings and the high ground of the tower were a rare advantage. The Ming officials had fled, but they had left behind an unseen enemy.

Shortly after the military group secured the buildings, several men were bitten by fleas and had to beat a hasty retreat. The old brick and wood structures were a breeding ground for pests, a haven for the parasites that had plagued humanity for millennia.

Shi Niaoren, the head of the medical group, had anticipated this. His epidemic prevention team, clad in full protective gear, descended on the buildings like a scene from a sci-fi horror film, their sprayers dispensing a fog of insecticide. The dilapidated furniture was dragged out and burned on the beach. The men who had been bitten were unceremoniously sprayed from head to toe and sent back to the ship for a thorough decontamination.

After an hour of fumigation and ventilation, the Landing Command Post occupied the main hall of the office. The radio was set up, maps were spread across the tables, and the server, powered by a bank of batteries, hummed to life. A wireless network was established, a digital web that connected the disparate parts of their sprawling operation. Data began to flow: personnel check-ins, cargo manifests, a constant stream of information that brought a semblance of order to the chaos.

On the *Fengcheng*, the transmigrators, organized into groups, lined up to disembark. Their backpacks, heavy with issued equipment, were a suffocating weight. Their personal luggage remained in the hold, a distant promise of comfort.

The ship's loudspeakers blared a constant stream of directives: follow command, stay within the perimeter, dispose of waste properly, do not consume local game, report any illness immediately.

To manage the workforce, the command post had devised a system of colored armbands: red for the military, blue for ship-based personnel, white for technical specialists, and yellow for the command staff. The "basic laborers" were organized into five-man teams, each with a numbered armband and a work manual to track their assignments and issued equipment. The system, a simple but effective tool of social engineering, allowed the human resources group to manage the workforce with a surprising degree of efficiency.

On the beach, in a large military tent that served as the "Bopu Port Area Construction Command Post," the engineers and architects were gathered. "Project Number One," the floating pier, was now complete, a lifeline connecting the ships to the shore. A steady stream of equipment and materials was now flowing across it.

Inside the tent, four figures were hunched over a map, the "Four Heavenly Kings" of the engineering group: Bing Feng, the structural engineer; Yan Quezhi, the hydrologist; Mei Wan, the construction manager; and [Li Xiaol端][y156], the planner and architect. Mei Wan, the most experienced of the four, was in charge.

"The command post wants the basic infrastructure in place by nightfall," he announced. "Power, water, cargo yards, and basic fortifications. We have priority on all materials, machinery, and labor."

"We haven't even surveyed the area," [Li Xiaol端][y156] protested. "The terrain is completely different from the 21st-century maps."

"No time for that," Mei Wan replied, his voice firm. "We'll survey, design, and build simultaneously." He was a man who knew how to get things done. He quickly assigned tasks: [Li Xiaol端][y156] and Yan Quezhi would handle the surveying, Tian Jiujiu the water supply, [Chang Kaishen][y010] the power, and Bing Feng the arduous task of building the cargo yards.

[Chang Kaishen][y010]'s job was the easiest. The main power would be drawn directly from the *Fengcheng*'s auxiliary engine, a 380-volt cable running along the floating pier to a shore-based distribution station. The plan was simple, reliable, and easy to implement.

The initial design, however, was quickly overturned. The Executive Committee, fearing electrical leaks and damage to the cable from the constant traffic on the pier, demanded a new solution. The engineers dismantled a set of floating units, stringing the empty barrels together with steel wire to create a floating conduit. The new line not only carried the power cable, but also a fuel pipe for diesel and a telephone line, connecting the ship to the shore. The IT group, in a stroke of genius, used the telephone line to establish a network connection, bringing the entire operation online. The OA system had achieved full coverage.
