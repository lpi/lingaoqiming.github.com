If it was about gathering intelligence, the network established by the Guangzhou station in Leizhou was already capable of collecting most of it. There was little concept of secrecy here; with some time and effort, almost anything could be found out. Why did the Executive Committee send Bei Wei and this mysterious Chen Tianxiong? What was their real purpose? Were they really planning to occupy Leizhou?

Despite his doubts, Chang Shide didn't dare to ask. With the "central" authorities present, he couldn't call the women to his room these days. Chang Shide, who had grown accustomed to a life of nightly revelry, found it somewhat unbearable.

That evening, Bei Wei and Chen Tianxiong, who had been hiding in the courtyard with their team, came to see them.

"We have indeed come to Leizhou with a mission," Chen Tianxiong said, getting straight to the point.

Chang Shide and Wen Tong both nodded. Wen Tong stood up, went to the door, and looked out into the courtyard. He said to Zhou Shizhai, who was meditating under the eaves, "Keep an eye out. Don't let anyone come near."

Zhou Shizhai gave a slight nod, and Wen Tong returned to the room.

"Go on, what is it specifically?"

"This plan is still in the evaluation stage. Bei Wei and I are actually tasked with the same mission: to conduct a field survey to assess the feasibility of the plan and gather operational data. As for the content of the plan, I can tell you—" He paused. "The name of the plan is the 'Tang Monk Project'."

Tang Monk Project?! Wen Tong and Chang Shide were stunned. Was this some kind of joke?

Seeing their expressions, Chen Tianxiong explained, "Do you remember the first tribulation Tang Monk faced after his birth?"

"The story of Jiang Liu'er—" They had, of course, all read *Journey to the West* and wracked their brains trying to recall the events surrounding Tang Monk's birth.

Chang Shide's face changed. "Are we going to be river pirates?!"

"That's right," Chen Tianxiong nodded.

A member of the Intelligence and Information Committee, while compiling the *Historical Reference Materials*, had stumbled upon a story in the *Leizhou Annals*.

During the Chongzhen era, an official appointed to be the prefect of Leizhou was robbed by a group of mountain bandits on his way to his post with his family. The official and his family were killed. The strange thing was that the leader of the bandits, using the official's documents, actually went to Leizhou, took over from the previous prefect, and became a proper official.

This bandit served as an official in Leizhou for two years, and his reputation was quite good. It wasn't until the real official's son came to Leizhou to seek refuge and discovered the bandit's identity that he reported it to the local Jinyiwei. In the end, the Jinyiwei arranged a banquet, lured the bandit to an ambush, and captured him. The bandit confessed to everything.

This "curious tale" unearthed from the old records sparked the imagination of the intelligence department. The *Leizhou Annals* was a local history, and its historical reliability was very high.

What if the person who took over the post was not a bandit, but a member of the transmigrator group?

The idea was so fantastic and bold that it was met with opposition from many in the Internal Affairs Committee and the Intelligence Committee as soon as it was proposed. But its supporters also presented the most powerful argument: if an ordinary mountain bandit could hold the position of Leizhou prefect for so long and govern well, a transmigrator from the 21st century should be able to do so as well. Moreover, the transmigrators had the entire transmigrator group as their backing.

Opponents raised the question that the Ming Dynasty bandit was able to impersonate a prefect only by taking advantage of the underdeveloped information network of the time. In any case, the bandit was a person of that era, and his understanding of all aspects of Ming society was much deeper than that of these visitors from the 21st century. To have someone from a completely different era impersonate an official was simply preposterous.

"The differences between us and the natives are too obvious when we stand among them!" Ran Yao argued vehemently. "If you asked me to impersonate the mayor or party secretary of a county-level city in the 21st century, it might be possible. At least I've seen a pig run, even if I haven't eaten pork. But this is like asking a pure-blooded Anglo-Saxon American to be a city leader. Is that possible? And the gap between us and the people of the Ming Dynasty is even greater than the difference between modern Americans and Chinese!"

His argument was well-founded, but the potential benefits were too great to ignore. The entire Leizhou Prefecture would indirectly fall under the control of the transmigrators. Although the Leizhou prefect had various subordinate officials, the transmigrators had no doubt that with a combination of economic and military pressure, these people would all submit. This would ultimately create a "white-skinned, red-hearted" local regime.

Things like facilitating the industrial and commercial penetration of the transmigrator regime were minor. The key was that they could openly enter the Ming Dynasty's bureaucracy, participate in its operations, and obtain direct government information. This was much more timely and reliable than the Guangzhou station's method of bribing yamen officials for information. Controlling Leizhou would add a buffer zone for Hainan Island. If the Ming Dynasty were to launch a military campaign against Lingao one day, Leizhou, being close by, would inevitably be the main area for troop movements. It would provide a reliable base for both intelligence gathering and harassment.

"If replacing one official can bring such great benefits, why don't we just go to Guangzhou, assassinate the Guangzhou prefect, and then replace the successor on the road?" someone raised this question.

"Because the bandit in Leizhou succeeded in history, while the replacement of the Guangzhou prefect never happened. Now we just need to replace the bandit, just as we are preparing to replace the Qing Dynasty," said Chen Tianxiong, a fervent supporter of the plan.

After several internal discussions, the plan was submitted to the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee for discussion.

"I object! This is a critical period for the development of the transmigrator government. The knowledge possessed by every transmigrator is very precious. I object to such a dangerous undertaking!" Wu Nanhai was firmly opposed.

"Are we going to stop the revolution just because we're afraid of dying?" Xi Yazhou reappeared at the meeting after a long "recuperation," his waistline having expanded, his once slightly lean and capable appearance from over a year of training having reverted to that of a wargaming otaku. "I firmly support this proposal. It will be of great help to our future development."

"Let's select some loyal natives to go. We people, our speech is not right, and we can't even write properly. It's too difficult to impersonate a Ming Dynasty prefect," Xiao Zishan cautiously expressed his opinion.

"Who says bandits can't write well? Maybe he was illiterate, but he still managed to be an official for two years and governed well."

"Who says bandits are uncultured? Maybe he was cultured but just fell on hard times."

"Maybe he was one of our predecessors... a pity his ambitions were not fulfilled..."

"Attention, don't go off-topic," Ma Qianzhu, who was chairing the meeting, had a deep-seated hatred for the "off-topic" culture of every meeting.

"On this point, I agree with Committee Member Xiao," said Wu De. "It's not just a matter of speaking and writing. In many aspects of our daily habits and behavior, we are out of sync with the natives. It's fine when dealing with the common people; at most, they'll think you're eccentric. The real fear is encountering colleagues, subordinates, superiors, and the gentry. These people are not so easily fooled."

"I think we should select some loyal natives to do it," someone suggested. "For example, Zhang Xingjiao. He is educated and can speak Mandarin. He should be able to do it."

"Comrade, revolution is not a dinner party. This task, although dangerous, is a very critical one. If we don't send our own people to take charge, can you guarantee the reliability of a few surrendered natives? Zhang Xingjiao is reliable now, but what if he gets carried away with being an official and decides to betray us for a real official position?" Xi Yazhou retorted bluntly.

"Then we don't have to have a transmigrator be the prefect. We can use a puppet and control them from behind the scenes," Wu Nanhai said.

"That makes it even less secure. Don't forget, we are sending someone to infiltrate the court. The most important thing is this official position. If we use a puppet, what's the difference between that and just collecting information from the common people?" Wei Aiwen said contemptuously. "He's a civilian official, after all, afraid of death."

"How can you say that? Without us administrative personnel, where would your army get its weapons and food?" Wu Nanhai jumped up as if his tail had been stepped on and pointed at him.

"And what about our army serving as free labor for you every day? It's all unpaid!" Wei Aiwen's posture suggested he was ready to settle accounts with the agricultural department once and for all.

"Without our military protection, it's a question of whether the transmigrator group could even survive," Le Lin, the navy's representative at the meeting, chimed in. The navy's hotheads, Li Haiping and most of the top brass, were at sea, so this role was now played by the Hong Kong military enthusiast who "dressed like a Hollywood actor." Although the young guns of the navy and army didn't see eye to eye on many things, especially when it came to competing for resources and manpower, they disliked the administrative personnel who controlled the transmigrator government's economy even more.

"Alright, everyone, quiet down." Facing a potential conflict between the civil and military factions, President Wen spoke up in a timely manner. "The position of Leizhou prefect is very crucial for us. My view is that we should try our best to occupy it. Leizhou is also a key area of our operations. As for whether the Leizhou prefect should be a transmigrator or a native, we can discuss that later. First, let's vote on whether to implement this proposal. Now, let's vote. Those in favor, please raise your hands." He raised his own hand as he spoke.

The resolution was passed by an overwhelming majority.

"Alright, actually, we've overlooked a problem," Wen Desi said slowly. "What year did this happen? Chongzhen had seventeen years, after all."

"According to the *Leizhou Annals*, it was in 1632."

"So there are still three years," Wen Desi said. "A lot can be done in three years. The first thing we should do now is to send people to Leizhou to conduct a field survey of the terrain and social environment to assess the difficulty of this plan."

"That's right. I'd also like to remind those of you who are very enthusiastic about this that this is extremely difficult to execute," Ran Yao reminded everyone. "We don't know the name of the official who was appointed, where he was from, which road he took, or on what date he entered Leizhou. The book doesn't say any of this."

"Isn't that obvious? He must have been in a sedan chair, with people in front holding signs like 'Silence' and 'Make Way'..."

"Don't be ridiculous. He hadn't even taken office yet," Yu E'shui said. "Ran Yao is right. If we don't investigate these details, how can the Special Reconnaissance Team intercept him? There's another thing: we have to act before that bandit does. I think finding this bandit is much more difficult than finding the official."

Xiao Zishan said, "That's right. An official taking office always leaves a trail. But this nameless bandit, we don't know where he was based, and Leizhou is so big. It's like finding a needle in a haystack."

"That's not a big problem," Xi Yazhou said. "The key is the official. If we can find him, we can find the bandit. It doesn't matter if the bandit acts first. As long as he hasn't taken the official seal, we can still take him out on the road. From this perspective, the bandit and the official are irrelevant. The main thing is to get the official's luggage and documents."

After the plan was finalized, the Executive Committee authorized the Intelligence Committee to formulate the "Tang Monk Project." The project was divided into two parts. One part was to recruit future infiltrators from among the transmigrators. The prerequisite for recruitment was that the transmigrator group's cause would not be affected if this person was lost. And he had to be a volunteer. After being recruited, they would receive training from the Intelligence Committee to quickly master the customs and official language of the Ming Dynasty, and also practice their handwriting. At the same time, the Civil Affairs Committee was instructed to find usable young intellectuals among the subjects under the transmigrator regime, select them for preferential treatment and brainwashing, and use them as backup personnel.

The other part was to carry out large-scale intelligence gathering in Leizhou to prepare for and evaluate the Tang Monk Project. Considering that the South China Sugar Factory was actually a factory and not a convenient intelligence gathering point, the Executive Committee decided to only use them as a support unit. Chen Tianxiong was sent to Leizhou as a dedicated intelligence officer to make full use of the network established by the Guangzhou station in Leizhou for intelligence gathering.

After hearing Chen Tianxiong's introduction, Wen Tong and Chang Shide finally understood. Chang Shide said excitedly, "This is really exciting! Replace everyone with our own people, hahaha... It would be best to replace the Xuwen county magistrate as well!"

"The idea is good, but the Leizhou prefect is in Haikang County. The prefecture and county are in the same city. I'm afraid it won't be so easy for a fake prefect to act, right?" Wen Tong was deeply worried.

"That's why Bei Wei is here," Chen Tianxiong said.

"I'm here this time to conduct a reconnaissance trip for the Tang Monk Project," Bei Wei nodded. "To get a comprehensive understanding of the terrain and urban environment of the entire Leizhou Prefecture, so we have a clear picture."

"Good. If you need anything, just ask. We will do our best to be a strong backup for your intelligence work."

"Help me find a reliable guide," Bei Wei said. "Someone who is familiar with the local situation."

"Of course. Liao Dahua, the manager of the Qiwei branch, is a good choice. He is familiar with both the officials and the common people. But he doesn't know martial arts..."

"It doesn't matter. We are here for reconnaissance. We plan to disguise ourselves as small merchants and walk around to have a look."
