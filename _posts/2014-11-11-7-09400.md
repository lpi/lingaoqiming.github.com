Lin Baiguang's Comprehensive Management Office was actually located within the Municipal Government building. After Wang Sangou took office as the head of the city's General Affairs Section, he systematized and regulated the once chaotic and bustling city government according to the "Regulations on the Administration of General Affairs in Government Organs" issued by the General Office. Now, if Liu San wanted to talk to any local personnel from outside, he couldn't just casually send someone to fetch them. He had to first fill out a "summons slip," which would then be sent to the General Affairs Section to dispatch someone.

By the time Liu San finished his work, it was already getting dark. But these were extraordinary times, and there was no concept of fixed working hours. All government agencies operated 24/7, with someone on duty at all times. As soon as Liu San's slip was delivered to the General Affairs Section, Wang Sangou immediately issued a night pass and sent several retained gatekeepers to find the people on the list.

These medical officials had already gone to bed. Hearing that the new Senate Chief Medical Officer was summoning them, they quickly got up, dressed, and followed the gatekeepers. Liu San hadn't even finished his dinner when the four medical officials were already waiting outside his house.

Liu San looked out the window and saw them waiting respectfully in the courtyard. They were all old men by the standards of this time, and one of them had completely white hair and a white beard. He felt embarrassed to keep them waiting outside for long and asked his orderly to let them in first. Since he was considered a high-ranking official dispatched from a central ministry, he occupied the main building of a small courtyard. The central room of the main building served as a reception room and meeting room.

When Liu San came out from the inner room holding his meal box, the four medical officials stood up in unison and were about to kneel for a formal court greeting. Liu San quickly said, "No need, no need. Please, sit down."

The medical officials saw that this Great Song Chief Medical Officer was not only poorly dressed but also ate like a common laborer, holding an "iron rice bowl"—a square tin box—while eating. They couldn't help but feel a little disdainful. However, they knew from their first meeting a few days ago that this "Chief Medical Officer" was learned and well-versed in medical theory, pulse diagnosis, and pharmacology, so they didn't dare to underestimate him. They thanked him and sat down.

They were all very anxious. A new dynasty meant a new court of officials. The position of "medical officer" in the "Medical Office" didn't require an appointment from the Ministry of Personnel; it was an "unranked" position. Forget about a change of dynasty, even a change of county magistrate could get them dismissed at any time. Therefore, whenever a new county magistrate or prefect took office, they had to bribe and curry favor to keep their positions.

Once unemployed, without the halo of being a medical official, life as an ordinary itinerant doctor would be extremely difficult. Although famous doctors earned a decent income, most ordinary practitioners could only make a meager living. They knew they were not at the level of "famous doctors."

When Liu San first met them, the medical officials had pooled their money to present a "public gift" of sixty taels of silver. However, Liu San's polite refusal left them unable to guess the Chief Medical Officer's intentions. Especially after the private gifts were also rejected, everyone found him even more inscrutable.

It was already dark, yet he had suddenly summoned them. What was he planning?

Liu San put down his meal box and said:

"You are all veteran medical officials in Guangzhou. You have treated many patients, and you have also presided over and assisted in the government's medical affairs. I have just arrived and don't know much about the local situation. I need to consult with you."

The medical officials quickly stood up and repeatedly said they were unworthy, only asking Liu San to "inquire."

"Don't be so polite. We are all doctors; saving lives is our duty," Liu San said with great sincerity. "Don't think about ranks. Let's first talk about the epidemic situation in Guangzhou."

What Liu San wanted to inquire about were the various "seasonal epidemics" of spring and autumn and the common local diseases encountered in medical practice.

The Health Department had great concerns about the sanitation and epidemic prevention in large pre-modern cities. The reason was simple: in this time and space, there were no immunization measures, and the spread of various pathogens was rampant. The increasingly developed long-distance trade also spread many local infectious diseases to various places.

The variety of infectious diseases encountered by the Health Department in the purification camps over the past few years, and the wide range of their geographical origins, had greatly surprised the doctors. They had encountered almost all the infectious diseases listed in the textbooks: smallpox, measles, dysentery, typhoid, diphtheria, encephalitis, dengue fever, cholera, black fever, scarlet fever, hepatitis, tuberculosis... Among the northern immigrants, they had even detected the dreaded plague, which had led to the burning of quarantine camp wooden sheds in Kaohsiung more than once. Syphilis, which had been introduced to China not long ago, was also detected among the immigrants, and there were even cases of mother-to-child transmission. Tuberculosis was even more widespread.

Through the simple yet effective tool of quarantine, the Senate had basically managed to keep various virulent infectious diseases at bay. But in Guangzhou, things were not so simple. Guangzhou was a city located on the mainland, open on all sides, making it difficult to control the flow of population. This provided favorable conditions for the spread of diseases.

The Health Department had originally intended to search the historical records in the Grand Library to investigate the infectious disease problem in Guangzhou. However, whether it was the officially compiled local gazettes or private notes, they were all very vague on such matters, simply recording them as "epidemics" or "great epidemics." Besides the number of deaths and the duration, there was very little detailed information, not even descriptions of symptoms. It was impossible to discern any details from these simple records.

Therefore, Liu San could only turn to the local medical officials. The reason he asked them was that for the lower classes of ancient society, seeking medical treatment was basically not an option. When they got sick, they either relied on their own resistance to fight it off, or they prayed to gods and Buddhas for a bag of incense ash. At best, they would get some medicine from a pharmacy or a charity when it was being distributed. Those who could afford to invite a doctor for consultation were at least families with some assets. Therefore, the patient base of ordinary doctors was very narrow, and the cases they encountered were not of general significance.

The medical officials, on the other hand, were personnel of "public medical institutions." For local plagues and seasonal diseases, whether for prevention, treatment, or aftermath, the county "Medical Office" had to be involved. They were also responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of the people housed in the county's various charitable institutions. Compared to ordinary doctors, they had a more comprehensive understanding.

Liu San was eager to understand the specific situation of infectious diseases in order to quickly formulate a response plan. The Health Department's opinion was to establish a dedicated infectious disease hospital as soon as possible to isolate and accommodate all such patients. This was also a continuation of the traditional practice of the quarantine camps—in the absence of drugs, this was the only feasible method.

Liu San first shared some of his observations from his inspections of the city over the past few days. He knew that traditional medicine in this time and space had no clear concept of hygiene and epidemic prevention, and many issues that modern people would consider prone to causing disease were taken for granted at the time. So he only mentioned some situations they could understand.

"...The 'Huinan Tian' is coming soon, and I know this weather is the easiest for epidemics to spread. Since our Senate has entered Guangzhou, we have the responsibility to protect this region. Let's work together to ensure the peace and tranquility of the people here, so they get sick less and fewer die. This would be an infinite merit."

This speech greatly surprised the medical officials. They had been medical officials for many years and had seen too many "admonitions" from new officials: either they would give a stern, high-sounding but empty speech, or they would "hint" that they should quickly show their respects with gifts. No one had ever mentioned matters of treating the sick and saving lives.

They never expected that this foreign Australian would talk to them about this matter as soon as he entered the city! And this true "Kun" had quietly visited many places in the city to inquire about the people's suffering—some places they themselves had never entered because they were so poor and filthy. They were deeply moved. They were all from families that had practiced medicine for generations and held traditional medical ethics in high regard. Liu San's words resonated with them. The oldest medical official, named Hu Ziming, stood up tremblingly and bowed, saying, "Sir, upon taking office, you have disregarded the fatigue of your journey and immediately concerned yourself with the suffering of the people. This is truly a blessing for the common folk! This student will certainly do his utmost to repay your kindness." The others echoed his sentiment.

Then, they began to recount what they had seen and heard in their many years of medical practice. Liu San listened carefully and took notes in a notebook. Although he himself had studied traditional Chinese medicine, many diseases had different names in ancient and modern times, so he specifically asked the medical officials to describe the symptoms when they spoke.

According to the medical officials' descriptions, Liu San roughly knew that the most common infectious disease here was influenza—which did not surprise him. But the mortality rate of influenza was not low: colds often led to complications like inflammation, and in ancient times, without antibiotics and antipyretics, it was not uncommon to die from a cold.

Among the virulent infectious diseases, the most common in Guangzhou were smallpox and cholera. Small-scale outbreaks occurred at any time, and large-scale outbreaks happened every few years. Especially cholera, there would be a major outbreak every seven or eight years, and the interval for smallpox outbreaks was only five or six years.

What shocked Liu San the most was that, from the medical officials' descriptions, he learned that Guangzhou had already experienced multiple outbreaks of bubonic plague. Some of them had lasted for a long time, were very severe, and had resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.

The Senate was "terrified at the mere mention" of the plague. They had originally thought that the plague was mainly prevalent in the north, but they had not expected it to have already broken out in Guangzhou.

Besides these three most fatal virulent infectious diseases, from the symptoms described by the medical officials, other infectious diseases were also common, especially intestinal infectious diseases, which had a very high incidence rate. Dysentery was quite common, and the "fasha," which had the highest mortality rate in the summer, Liu San estimated was also mostly an intestinal infectious disease.

From the medical officials' descriptions, he also roughly sorted out the various common diseases in Guangzhou at this time: scrub typhus, malaria, typhoid, tuberculosis, dysentery, meningitis... Leprosy, which was dreaded by the ancients, was also on the list.

The medical officials also told him that there was a local "distention disease," where a person's abdomen would gradually swell up like a drum. Although it didn't cause immediate death, the person would eventually die. No matter what miracle doctor you consulted, they were helpless. In some villages in Panyu and Nanhai counties, this disease was very severe, affecting men, women, old, and young alike, and some villages had even been wiped out because of it.
