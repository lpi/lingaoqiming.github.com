However, this risk was worth taking! When Lin Baiguang came to Nanri, he took the outer sea route, and the one-way trip took more than six days. In ancient times, there were no telegraphs or telephones for instant communication. Once the fleet set off from Nanri, Zhu Cailao could only wait. It would take at least fifteen days for him to realize that something was wrong.

Even if he found out that something was wrong, he wouldn't know what the problem was: whether the ship had encountered danger and sank, was robbed, or got lost... The various uncertainties of sailing made it difficult for him to make a decision to deal with him for a while. Lin Baiguang estimated that he would be safe for at least fifteen days from the time the fleet set sail.

Fifteen days, a lot of things can be done. Fifteen days was also enough for Zhu Cailao to run out of food and be forced to launch an attack.

Thinking of this, he began to write this letter.

The content of the letter was very simple, nothing more than informing the Executive Committee of the agreement, writing down the conditions and requirements of both sides. At the same time, he informed Lingao that Zhu Cailao would immediately use the loan to buy grain, and as soon as the ship arrived, he would ask for the grain to be sold.

The letter was straightforward and did not use any code words. This was to gain the trust of Zhu Cailao—he would definitely have to check it carefully before letting the messenger take it away. Therefore, Lin Baiguang did not use any secret writing or code. He did not know how high the level of secret writing was in ancient times. As for the code, although the other party might not be able to decipher it, they would naturally be suspicious if they saw it.

He believed that Ran Yao and others had enough wisdom to understand the meaning he conveyed in the letter. After finishing writing, he blew the ink dry, put it in an envelope, and did not write any inscription. He gave it to the young pirate outside and asked him to give it to the messenger going to Lingao.

Let Zhu Cailao study it if he wants to, Lin Baiguang thought with a secret smile.

At noon, Shi Shisi brought people to deliver food. The food was as exquisite as usual. Lin Baiguang found it hard to believe that this was the food of an army that was about to run out of food: there were still four dishes: roasted ox scalp, blanched duck tongue, clear soup with bird's nest, and steamed abalone. Except for the slightly different seasoning from modern times, these dishes would not be inferior even if they were served in a large modern restaurant.

"Such a good table of wine and food is too wasteful for me alone. With dishes and wine, it's better for Brother Shi to drink with me."

"Good," Shi Shisi was not a coy person, not to mention that this kind of food was almost completely unavailable on Nanri Island recently. Although he, a middle-level leader, had enough to eat, it was not so exquisite after all.

"I'll go get a few jars of good wine right away." Shi Shisi was about to go out as he spoke.

"Since we are drinking, it's better to have more people."

"That's naturally good, but—" he stared at the wine and dishes on the table with a hesitant look on his face.

Lin Baiguang smiled and said, "It's nothing. This Nanri Island is surrounded by the sea. Is it possible that we can't catch a few nets of fish and shrimp?" He took out a small piece of silver from his waist, which was about two taels. "Brother Shi, take it to buy, and find a cook to cook—I think the cook's skills here are very good."

"Where do we need so much?" Shi Shisi refused to take his silver. "Fish and shrimp, just ask the young ones to go and catch them. They are all from fishing families, so it's a piece of cake. As for the cook, five qian is enough—I can afford it! We can't afford the chef dedicated to Zhu Laoda, but the one from the small kitchen is fine."

Shi Shisi refused to take the silver and went away by himself. Lin Baiguang helped himself, cleared the table, and took out some dried meat, preserved fruits, and other dry food suitable for drinking from his bag.

About half an hour later, Shi Shisi came with people and added seven or eight more dishes to the table, all of which were seafood. They were nothing more than razor clams, oysters, prawns, and seaweed, which were the most common food on this island.

"There's only this seafood..." Shi Shisi rubbed his hands with some embarrassment. "I couldn't even find a few eggs."

"It's already very sumptuous!"

"I've invited a few friends I usually get along with. They also want to meet you, brother!" Shi Shisi said with a squinting smile. "Everyone wants to go to Lingao to have a taste of this Australian novelty." He laughed out loud as he spoke.

Lin Baiguang smiled and said, "What's so difficult about that? When things are settled here, just come over. Everything will be on me!"

As they were talking, four or five more people came in one after another, of different heights and builds. Shi Shisi introduced them one by one. They were all "shopkeepers" of various groups, and there were also small leaders in Zhu Cailao's central army. Everyone greeted each other and took their seats.

Shi Shisi had someone bring in a few more jars of wine.

"I got this from a ship a few years ago. It's real Lanling wine." Shi Shisi was in high spirits. He broke the mud seal and poured wine for everyone one by one.

After a round of toasts and three rounds of wine, everyone began to chat idly, only talking about the novelties of the Australians in Lingao. Sure enough, these few people were extremely interested in the AV that Shi Shisi had watched in Lingao.

From their mouths, Lin Baiguang learned that Zhu Cailao had long been interested in the transmigrator group. When the Gou family estate was annihilated, Zhu Cailao had once thought of moving his entire army to Lingao, but he was afraid of the transmigrator group's "giant ships" and "fast boats" and did not act. Instead, he sent Shi Shisi to "fish." Later, Zhu Cailao was caught in a chaotic battle with Liu Xiang and had no time for other things.

That was a close call! Lin Baiguang thought that if it weren't for the sufficient deterrent power of his own iron ship, plus the chaotic situation on the southeast coast, if Zhu Cailao had really launched a full-scale attack at that time, although the transmigrator group, which had not yet established a firm foothold, would not have been wiped out, it would have been inevitable to suffer heavy losses.

When there was too much wine, the words began to be spoken indiscriminately.

"It's really good to have someone in the court to be an official." Shi Shisi showed a look of indignation.

"Oh? Who has offended Brother Shi?"

"Humph, I should have been the one to go to Lingao to buy grain in the first place. I've been there twice, I'm familiar with the road, and I know your rules there. But they had to replace me with He Xin, this idiot! Isn't it because he is the cousin of the little wife of the great shopkeeper Zhu's brother-in-law!"

Lin Baiguang couldn't figure out this complicated relationship for a moment, but he understood the meaning. The "good job" of buying goods in Lingao was snatched away by someone with connections.

"Forget it, he has a backer. How can we, who came from a poor background, compare with him?"

"Damn it! If I had known, I wouldn't have talked about the things in Lingao! If I had said it was a living hell, he wouldn't have competed with me." Obviously, Shi Shisi was still obsessed with the various "adventures" in Lingao.

From his mouth, Lin Baiguang knew that the ships going to Lingao were twelve large ships directly under Zhu Cailao's command. The smallest was five or six hundred liao, and the largest was two thousand liao—this Zhu Cailao was going to Lingao to "eat the big households."

"Brother Shi, don't mind it. There will be many opportunities to go to Lingao in the future."

"He Xin, this little bastard, relies on being some kind of damn relative. He doesn't go to war, but he gets all the benefits. These royal relatives who rely on women to sell their X are not good things!"

"Forget it, in this world, where is it not like this." A leader named Lin Dan drank a bowl. "We are drinking and eating meat here, and the young ones below are gnawing on fish bones and drinking salt water. Do you think they are happy?"

"We earned this wine and meat with our swords and spears. Like you," Shi Shisi pointed to a fat man next to him, "Old Hu built his own ship with his own money and brought his whole family to join us. They all have capital. What capital does He Xin have? He relies on women's things?"

The crowd burst into laughter, and someone laughed: "Maybe his 'capital' is a few inches longer than yours..."

Lin Baiguang found that the topic of "sex" always aroused heated discussions among everyone.

Shi Shisi was indignant and poured out a lot of his grievances: "We risk our lives in battle, but they are the first to get a share of the money..."

"Brother Shi, be careful with your words! Be careful with your words!" Lin Baiguang liked this kind of reaction very much, but the matter of Xiaoshu yesterday made him alert—who knew if this Shi Shisi was deliberately putting on an act? Even if he wasn't, inside and outside this tent, there were probably a few spies paying attention to his every move.

Shi Shisi, under the influence of alcohol, still wanted to curse, but was stopped by others. The fat man surnamed Hu drank a bowl of wine and sighed, "Our big gang is getting worse year by year. I remember back then, the two fleets, north and south, roamed Fujian and Guangdong. What a sight, what a style! Now we are reduced to staying on this small island to get by, and we are in a dilemma!"

"In the final analysis, it was Zheng Zhilong, this traitor, who broke the rules! If I catch him, I will definitely cut him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!"

"Humph, you think Li Kuiqi doesn't want to, and the big boss doesn't want to? But now he is a dignified guerrilla, an official of the court."

"What's a guerrilla? A sesame-sized official. We've even killed a vice-general, why should we be afraid of him?"

"He has many men and ships," Lin Dan said, "and probably a lot of money. I just don't understand. Last year, when Li Kuiqi broke with him, didn't most of his men and ships go with Li Kuiqi? How did he become so powerful in less than a year?"

"The court supports him. I heard that Governor Xiong Wencan bought him cannons and built ships for him, and his strength has greatly increased."

"Xiong Wenhuan, this old thing, is thinking of using a borrowed knife to kill people."

"Zheng Zhilong is the same. He just wants to use the power of the government to wipe out all of us, and then he will be the only one doing business on the sea." Lin Dan sighed, "The big boss is no match for him."

Fatty Hu said, "Come, come, let's drink. Anyway, we can still get by for now. If it really doesn't work, I'll just raise the sail and run away with my whole family. At worst, I'll go to Southeast Asia to seek a living."

The crowd fell silent, all feeling that the future was worrying. At this time, someone whispered, "Have you heard? Black Flag Old Fourth is going to run away."

"Who said that?" Everyone was shocked. Black Flag Old Fourth was not an ordinary shopkeeper, but a backbone of the big gang. If he ran away, wouldn't it be a sign that the big tree was about to fall?

"It looks like it. All his men have returned to the ships. Not a single one is on shore."

"If it really doesn't work, I'll just run away too. This kind of life!"

"At that time, let's all go to Lingao." Shi Shisi suddenly blurted out this sentence. Lin Baiguang was startled. In his opinion, this was too blunt, and it almost had the meaning of luring him into a trap.

"That's right. Hearing you describe Lingao so well, I also want to go," someone responded.

"At that time, you have to be our introducer," Fatty Hu said with a sincere face.

"I can't say, I can't say." Lin Baiguang responded cautiously. "The situation of the great shopkeeper has not reached this point yet. Everyone should be at ease. As long as we get through these few months, maybe the situation will get better—hasn't the great shopkeeper already sent ships to Lingao to transport grain and gunpowder? If we are really unfortunate enough to be displaced, there will always be a mouthful of food for everyone in Lingao." He smiled and said, "But for now, everyone should work together to overcome the difficulties. If the big tree really falls, it's not a good thing for us monkeys."

"Shopkeeper Lin is right," Lin Dan said. "It's better to do what you know than what you don't. Maybe in a few more days, it will be a turning point."

"I'm just afraid that we are working together, but those who have eaten the most fruits in normal times have long wanted to get off the tree."

Xu Cheng, who had been silent for a long time, finally spoke. His face was flushed, as if he had been holding it in for a long time. He was a small leader in the central army. He had been drinking sullenly with his head down and had not said a word.

"You probably all don't know," Xu Cheng said with a thick tongue, "the brother of the fourth wife recently sent out several ships of goods. I don't know where they were sent... And the brother of the second great shopkeeper Wang is also gone... The iron boxes that used to store valuables in the old camp are also much fewer!"

Xu Cheng lowered his head and stammered, "I've seen through it. What brotherhood, what 江湖道义 (jiānghú dàoyì - righteousness of the martial arts world), it's all bullshit. Money is the only real thing. I've been with the big boss for more than ten years, and I'm not even in the front of the line when it comes to playing with women. It's all leftovers from others—but their relatives, clansmen, and slaves have all become leaders, and they transport women and goods to their homes by the boatload!"

"You've had too much to drink, don't drink anymore," a few people's faces became unnatural, and they hurriedly held him down to prevent him from talking nonsense. Shi Shisi hurried outside the tent to have a look. He was slightly relieved to see that only a few of his trusted subordinates were on guard outside.

"You guys keep a close watch. If anyone comes over, give me a signal!" After saying that, he went back into the tent. A few people here had already stuffed Xu Cheng's mouth with food.

"This, Brother Xu spoke out of turn after drinking, out of turn..."

"It's okay, it's okay, I didn't hear anything." Lin Baiguang said with a knowing smile.

It seemed that the morale here in Zhu Cailao was already very unstable. The vested interest group was frantically stealing and preparing to leave this sinking ship at any time—this was also the inevitable result of this kind of traditional family-style feudal enterprise group.

"Ahem, now, alas, really." Shi Shisi didn't know how to phrase it.

"It's okay, we'll continue drinking. Let's only talk about romance, only talk about romance."

It had been twelve days since Zhu Cailao's fleet sent to Lingao left Nanri Island.

These days, Zhu Cailao had no longer summoned him. Perhaps in his opinion, Lin Baiguang's use as an envoy was over. Now he was just a hostage.

Under Shi Shisi's introduction, Lin Baiguang got acquainted with many of the leaders in the fleet. Every day, besides drinking, he gambled—he had brought a lot of silver with him as activity funds. Lin Baiguang used the playing cards he brought to teach everyone to gamble on 21, and this novel card game, because it was simple and exciting, immediately became a popular gambling game for a while.

Because it was inconvenient to gamble in the central army stockade, he went to Shi Shisi's camp every day to drink, gamble, and watch the young pirates practice boxing and wrestling.

Xiaoshu was still sent to his tent to serve him every night. Lin Baiguang naturally would not be pretentious, and would even come up with some new tricks every night, and the screams could be heard for several li.

Gambling, playing with women, and drinking together, everyone just thought that Lin Baiguang was a person who indulged in sensual pleasures, and would not associate his frequent drinking with the leaders with other things. This was also his self-protection trick.

However, he strictly adhered to one point: he would never show even a hint of solicitation in any place. On the contrary, many people asked him about the situation and strength of Lingao. At this time, there were already small groups who had lost hope for the future and left the team with their ships at night.

It seems that when there is a great chaos, it will not be a problem for me to take away a hundred or so ships in time by grasping the situation. Lin Baiguang calculated.

However, in history, Zheng Zhilong and the Ming army's fleet pursued all the way to Nanri Island and defeated Zhu Cailao right on Nanri Island. How he could save his life in a chaotic battle was still a problem—wouldn't it be an injustice if he died in the chaotic army?

He thought about this every night. He was alone and unarmed. How could he cope? He thought that the only way was to go to Shi Shisi's ship before that. This old sea dog, Shi Shisi, always had the ability to escape.

But another threat却开始慢慢的降临到他身边。去临高的船队果然象他预计的那样没有按时归来。诸彩老等了几天之后开始烦躁不安。但是又不知道问题出在哪里。他开始疑心林佰光的来意，但是听人说他一天到晚喝酒赌钱，晚上玩女人也十分起劲，看不出有心怀鬼胎的样子。

“妈的，这到底是怎么回事！”

忽然林佰光就不能再出中军寨子了，虽然伙食和女人继续供应，施十四也常来看他，但是他等于是被软禁了。这是第一个危险的信号。林佰光知道，事情的分晓就在这几天了。

诸彩老久等粮饷不到，肯定会按照历史上的做法，全军发动去攻闽安——这是可以预见的。

不可预见的是，他会对买粮船队久久不归持有什么样的态度，会不会直接把他一刀砍了再出发去打仗？

林佰光无计可施，只好听天由命地等待着。他觉得：问题不大。

第十三天的傍晚。诸彩老和主要头目正在中军帐内议事，这时候听到梆子响，不由得一惊。

“出什么事了？！”他厉声问。不是敌袭的号炮声，但是敲打梆子就是有紧急的意外事件发生。

不多会有人已来禀告：又有一股船只脱队而去了。

“是黑旗老四的船！”

众头目顿时骚动起来。这黑旗老四不是小股，是有六艘大船。二十条小船的中等匪伙，他投在诸彩老旗下也有十来年了，忽然起锚离去，显然是对前途失去了信心。

“大掌柜！我这就去把他追回来！”

“算了！人去不中留。”诸彩老的面色铁青，“大家弟兄一场，你去拦他不免来个刀兵相见。让外人看着笑话。让他走吧，以后还留个相见的余地。”
