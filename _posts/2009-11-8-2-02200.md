Wu Mingjin was momentarily taken aback, and his heart was deeply moved. He knew that this Huang Dahuhu, out of a sense of public duty, would often lead his clansmen and local braves to fight against bandits whenever there was trouble in the area. He had already lost several close nephews, but he never expected to lose a son this time.

"Please accept my condolences, old sir. After the bandits retreat, I will report to my superiors and request a posthumous honor for your esteemed son." Huang Dahuhu had no official rank, but his son was a xiucai, and Magistrate Wu intended to elevate him, so he usually addressed him as "old sir."

"My son died for the peace of the region. My Huang family has received the grace of the state for generations, and we should sacrifice ourselves to repay the court and protect our homeland. We do not covet this posthumous honor." Huang Shoutong was unwilling to talk much about his son—although he had three sons, this one was born of a concubine and had no official rank, but the pain of losing a son was still heart-wrenching.

"I have come this time to warn you, magistrate," he said, getting straight to the point. "These sea pirates are different from the usual ones. My Lingao is about to face a great disaster!"

"Why do you say that, old sir?" Wu Mingjin was greatly alarmed. He knew that this old man was calm and tenacious, not one to make empty boasts.

Huang Shoutong then recounted the situation of his son leading a dozen local braves to ambush three pirate scouts near Bairen Tan the day before. Although he did not participate himself, the description of the returning local braves shocked him. A round of archery only brought down one of them. Although the old saying goes that three arrows are not as good as one sword, and the bows used by the local braves were not good, the other side had no armor. Two big men were hit by seven or eight arrows and could still charge all the way, killing several people in a row, and finally killing his son.

He closed his eyes and recalled the tragic state of his son's body when the local braves brought it back. Half of his cheek was almost shattered, and one eye was missing. Hearing the local braves describe the whole process, this person was hit by several arrows and surrounded by the local braves. His son, who had loved to practice martial arts since he was a child, was killed in a single round. Such a person was a rare fierce general even in the official army.

He was not very worried about individual bravery, but another thing that the local braves brought back made him very worried.

"The pirates' firearms are very powerful. One of them used a small handgun to kill several people in a row without even loading powder and shot. Please take a look, magistrate—" As he spoke, he handed over a cloth-wrapped bundle from his bosom. Wu Mingjin opened it and saw a dark blue piece of iron inside. It was very small and exquisite. From the style, it slightly resembled the handguns used by the red-haired people, but its appearance was simple, with no extra lines, and no place for a matchlock.

"This is a handgun?"

"Exactly," seeing Magistrate Wu's puzzled expression, Huang Shoutong said that this was picked up by the local braves when they returned to the battlefield afterwards. It was probably lost by the pirates in the melee.

"Is what the local braves said credible?" Magistrate Wu was still not very convinced. He was a scholar, but in the past twenty years, scholars and officials had all been fond of talking about military affairs and firearms. Although he had not seen all kinds of firearms in person, he had seen their drawings in books. This thing did not resemble any firearm, except that it also had a muzzle and a trigger.

[Note: In the late Ming Dynasty, there was a climax of discussion on firearms and gunpowder among intellectuals. Of course, most people were just armchair strategists. Song Yingxing criticized this trend in his "Tiangong Kaiwu".]

"It's credible. This gun doesn't need to be loaded with powder. You can fire it by pulling the trigger." Huang Shoutong stroked his beard and said, "After I brought it back, I tried to fire it once. The power is quite considerable. It can penetrate a thick wooden target from five zhang away, but it won't fire again. I think there are multiple charges of powder and shot pre-stored in this gun, and one charge is fired each time the trigger is pulled."

"Then it is a very powerful weapon." Wu Mingjin looked at the small, dark blue object in front of him with a worried expression. If the pirates had many such firearms, how could the bows and arrows of the local militia and braves resist them? It seemed that relying on cannons to defend the city was the best policy.

"I came to the county this time, first to give a warning, and second to ask the magistrate to allocate some equipment."

He was now the head of the six-village joint defense, with several hundred able-bodied men under his command, but he was short of weapons. Except for the leaders and some of his retainers who had swords and spears, the ordinary local braves only had wooden clubs. Lingao was originally lacking in ironware, and even more so in weapons. The swords and spears used by his family's retainers were left over from his ancestors many years ago. Although there were many bows and arrows, the climate of Hainan itself was not conducive to bows and arrows, and they were not easy to use.

Wu Mingjin could not refuse, so he allocated twenty waist swords, ten shields, forty tiger-head tridents, and five iron spears from the armory. He also gave him some gunpowder and iron shot—there were some iron cannons and swivel guns in Huang Family Village, but gunpowder was a prohibited item by the government, and it was difficult to obtain.

Just as Huang Shoutong was about to take his leave and rest, the gatekeeper came to report that the scouts who had gone out to scout in the morning had returned. Since the pirates landed, the county had sent out a batch of scouts every day to gather information. These people were all locals and were familiar with the terrain and paths.

They did not dare to open the city gate, but only lowered the prepared large basket to pull the people up to the city. The scouts went out every day without any damage, but today they returned in great panic. The people on the city wall saw their appearance and talked about it.

"What, building a road?" Magistrate Wu asked in surprise.

"Yes, my lord." The scout knelt on the ground and secretly glanced at the magistrate.

"They are building from Bopu to Bairen Tan. There are markers along the way. The pirates are piling up earth to make a road. They have already built about five or six li."

"Five or six li of road, you didn't see it wrong?!" Huang Shoutong rushed forward and demanded.

"I did not see it wrong." The scout looked fearfully at this famous figure in Lingao.

Huang Shoutong was very surprised. He turned his head and cupped his hands in a salute, saying, "Magistrate, the local braves of my village went to fight yesterday, and there was no road along the way..."

Wu Mingjin nodded and said in a deep voice, "Is the matter of road construction really what you saw with your own eyes, without any exaggeration? If there is half a word of falsehood, I will not spare you!"

The scout kowtowed repeatedly, "I dare not deceive you, my lord. They have indeed built five or six li of road." He also said that the pirates had evil arts. Many of their carts could move without wheels, and they had huge iron arms that could dig up earth with giant shovels. They could easily dig up and transport small hills of earth...

Evil arts again! Magistrate Wu did not believe in supernatural things, but the pirates had more and more things that were beyond his comprehension, and their abilities were getting stronger and stronger, which really worried him. Take this road construction, for example. He had thought about repairing bridges and roads in the county, but he was always constrained by various things. Either he lacked money and could not recruit civilian laborers, or the landlords on the land would make a fuss and refuse to give up their land. Even if everything went smoothly, he would not be able to build five or six li of road in two days—and it was a road made of piled earth. What kind of people were these pirates?

However, the problem at this time was not the road, but why the pirates were building a road. Since they were bandits, it could not be for accumulating merit; their intention was to rob, so this was superfluous. Besides, what was there to rob at Bairen Tan? There were only a few stonemasons there, and most of them had probably fled by now.

In his hesitation, he quickly ordered the officials in the county yamen, Liu Dalin, and the centurion who had come to reinforce them to be invited to discuss countermeasures together. After hearing the situation from the scout and Huang Dahuhu, the officials and gentry in the hall were all silent. They had originally thought that if the sea bandits landed, how bad could it be? At most, they would plunder the common people and burn down a few villages and market towns. Since the Song Dynasty, this county had never been captured, whether it was by the Li people's rebellion or by the plunder of sea bandits. Some people were even glad that this group of sea bandits landed after the Mid-Autumn Festival. If it were before the winter solstice when the autumn grain was harvested, the losses would probably be much more severe. However, in the past few days, bad news came one after another. First, the scouts reported that the other side had set up a large camp at Bopu and was unloading goods onto the shore day and night. Then, the Huang Family Village local braves, who had always been known for their bravery and fighting spirit, were defeated. Now the pirates were even building a road. No one knew what this group of髡发之徒 (kun fa zhi tu - people with cut hair) wanted to do.

Wu Mingjin looked at Liu Dalin, whom he relied on as a senior advisor, "What do you think, old sir?"

The Jinshi Liu supported his forehead with his hand and said after a long while, "Magistrate, this matter is of great danger."

Magistrate Wu and Wu Ya who were present were both startled. Magistrate Wu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, "Please teach me, old sir."

"I'm afraid the intention of these髡发 (kun fa - cut hair) sea pirates is to attack the city!"

"How can you tell?"

"Mountain bandits and sea pirates mostly engage in light raids. Why would they need to build a road? If they are building a road, the only explanation is that they intend to attack the city. I believe that the pirates must have siege equipment that is very heavy, and they cannot be transported to the city without building a road."

Siege equipment that required a road to be transported to the city, how big and heavy would that be? Everyone in the hall was suddenly silent. Wu Mingjin said with a trembling voice, "Could it be... Hongyi cannons..."

"Besides that, it's hard to think of anything else."

Hainan is close to Guangdong and Macau, and the ships of the red-haired foreigners often pass by. The court's purchase of cannons from the red-haired people in Guangzhou was also heard of in official circles. Wu Mingjin knew that this cannon was very heavy, but its power was amazing, and the court used it for the defense of Liaodong. The siege of Guangning last year was successfully defended thanks to this cannon, which can be called a sharp weapon in the army.

If there was such a thing pulled to the city now—Magistrate Wu dared not imagine what the result would be.

"What should we do? This county is just a small city." Wu Ya had already cried out in alarm. In fact, all the officials and gentry present understood his underlying meaning. What was there in this remote and small city of Lingao that was worth the pirates making such a big fuss? What sin had Lingao committed to attract such a killer weapon as the Hongyi cannon?

They did not know at this time that they were about to face something even more monstrous than the Hongyi cannon. As the catchphrase of the storytellers in the hundred schools of storytelling in Lingao City later went: "Tragedy!"

Everyone turned their eyes to Centurion Sun, who was wearing a mandarin duck standing robe. This hereditary centurion had originally thought this was a good assignment. As soon as he got off his horse in the city, he received a reward of ten taels of silver. He also skimmed off half of the reward given to the soldiers by the county. For the past two days, he had been eating and drinking well, which was much more comfortable than the half-dead days in the garrison. As for the pirates attacking the city, he felt that it was impossible.

Seeing that everyone in the hall was looking at him, he couldn't help but panic. He knew very well that although he had the title of a hereditary centurion, he was actually just a small landlord. The thirty soldiers he brought with him spent more time holding hoes than swords and spears. The only thing that had some power was that Franc-gun. How could he come up with a countermeasure? Besides, if the sea bandits really dragged over the Hongyi cannons, he would be too busy running for his life. Knowing that it was not good to say anything, he simply pretended to be calm and said nothing.

Magistrate Wu cursed Centurion Sun as a good-for-nothing in his heart, but he had not expected the garrison soldiers to be of much use anyway. He was afraid that he would have to ask General Tang to send troops for this matter.

"The only strategy now is to harass them," Liu Dalin said. "The髡贼 (kun zei - cut-hair bandits) can't always be gathered together when they are building the road. We should send more local braves, promise them heavy rewards, either harass them with bows and arrows, or set fire to them when there is an opportunity. Harass them day and night so that they can't rest. This will surely hinder their road construction."
