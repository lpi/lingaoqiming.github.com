Lingao Cape. A name that resonated with the echoes of history. It was here, on a spring night in 1950, that the Fourth Field Army had launched its invasion of Hainan, a turning point in the island's history.

In this new, older time, the Cape had not yet witnessed such grandeur, but it was already a place of strategic importance. A beacon tower had stood here since the Yuan Dynasty. In the Ming, the Bopu Inspection Office was established, tasked with interrogating all who passed. In its heyday, it had boasted a garrison of thirty archers and three patrol boats. Now, at the end of the Wanli era, it was a shadow of its former self, with only a dozen archers and a single, leaky boat.

Bei Wei scanned the coastline from the bow of the motorboat. He had studied the maps, reviewed the satellite images, and even walked this ground in another lifetime. He knew this place.

The sky was turning a pale, luminous white. Through his binoculars, the shore was a clear, sharp line. They were in Longhao Bay, a wide, sheltered expanse of water that was a favorite haunt of migrating fish. And there, extending from the northwest, was the familiar, triangular spit of land: Lingao Cape.

It was a natural breakwater, a kilometer and a half long, its sandy spine a brilliant white against the turquoise water. In the 21st century, it had been home to stone bunkers, a watchtower, and a lighthouse built by the Qing customs in 1893. Now, it was a wild, empty place, yet the shape of the land was the same.

"Slow down," Bei Wei cautioned. "Watch the water." The Cape was a treacherous maze of submerged reefs.

The water was crystal clear, the fine white sand between the reefs almost close enough to touch. They rounded the Cape and entered Chang'gong Bay, a two-kilometer-wide expanse of placid water, embraced by the two capes.

"I could swim here for a week," someone said.

"We'll build a resort here," another voice added, a touch of gallows humor in his tone. "For the senior cadres."

Bei Wei ignored them, his eyes fixed on the shore. He ordered the helmsman to keep their distance. An arrow from the shore was no joke.

"Captain, what's that mountain?" Li Jun pointed to a round, elliptical mound rising from the trees on the distant Bopu Cape.

"That's no mountain. It's a beacon tower."

The men on the boat were stunned. Their image of a beacon tower was of the eroded earthen platforms of the Silk Road. This was a behemoth, a stone-clad fortress with a rammed-earth core, at least twenty meters high. It was a monument to a forgotten age, a testament to the enduring fear of the sea.

"Helmets on," Bei Wei commanded. "There are Ming troops stationed here."

The motorboat rounded Bopu Cape and entered the estuary of the Wenlan River, the largest river in Lingao County. This was Bopu Port. The shores were a tangle of lush mangrove forests, scarred in places by fire and logging. The ruins of abandoned houses dotted the landscape, and the beach was littered with the debris of a recent typhoon. It was a desolate, forgotten place.

"This is the 'well-developed' county the Committee was talking about?" someone muttered.

Bei Wei shot him a look of disapproval. Discipline was already beginning to fray.

Bopu had long been a haven for pirates, a shortcut for raids on the northern coast of Hainan. It was a place of wildness and danger, a place where the law of the land held little sway.

"Cut the engine," Bei Wei ordered. "Measure the depth."

They had maps, but they were 400 years old. The river could have shifted its course a dozen times since then. The motorboat slowed to a crawl. Li Jun held up a riot shield, protecting the hydrographic team as they lowered a lead line into the murky water.

Bei Wei knew they were a perfect target, exposed and vulnerable. An arrow, he could handle. But a small cannon, hidden in the trees... a volley of iron shot at fifty meters would be devastating.

The men of the military group held their rifles, their eyes scanning the shore.

On the beacon tower, a lone figure watched them. He wore a rust-covered iron helmet and a suit of rotting leather armor, a relic of a bygone campaign. In his hand, he held a waist saber, its wooden scabbard bound with rattan strips. This was Fu Baiwen, the Patrol Inspector of this forgotten outpost, the commander of twelve archers and a single, leaky boat.

His world was one of desolation and boredom, punctuated by the occasional appearance of pirates. When they came, he would light the signal fire, a plume of smoke and flame that would send a warning up the Wenlan River to Lingao County. The common people would flee, the city gates would be barred, and he and his men would find a place to hide.

The arrival of the motorboat, its speed and strange design, had sent a jolt of alarm through the small garrison. The men on board were tall and strong, clad in black armor and carrying strange, black iron fire-tubes. They were not fishermen. They were not merchants. They were something new, something dangerous.

"Inspector Fu, who are they?" his second-in-command whispered.

"I do not know," Fu Baiwen replied. He had seen Japanese, Portuguese, even the red-haired barbarians from the west. But these men... they were outside his experience.

"They are measuring the depth," the archer observed.

Fu Baiwen nodded. To measure the depth meant a larger ship was coming.

"Should we light the fire?"

He hesitated. The newcomers were few, but they were heavily armed. They were clearly not here for peaceful purposes. And they were charting the waters, a sure sign of a larger force to come. It was broad daylight. The local people would be in their fields. If these were bandits, they would be slaughtered.

"Light the fire," he commanded.
