"Good, I'll have them build a dedicated courtyard for you at the sugar factory."

"No need," Bei Wei refused. "It's too conspicuous, and we won't be staying here long."

"Alright, the Qiwei Escort Agency has inns in both Haikang and Xuwen counties. You can rest there. You can also stay at the various properties of the South China Sugar Factory, but the conditions are average. I'll arrange for someone to notify them."

"No need. We'll stay at inns along the way. We'll try to avoid any association with the South China Sugar Factory."

"Do we have any missions?" Chang Shide was very excited.

"No," Bei Wei answered bluntly.

Chen Tianxiong said, "The sugar factory has no specific mission, just to cooperate with the operation. I will handle the specific matters. But I will still be the factory's technician."

Wen Tong was glad that there was no intelligence work; he wasn't interested in such things. There was still a lot to do at the sugar factory.

"The Tang Monk Project is a long-term operation. The next few years will be the preparation stage," Chen Tianxiong said. "How is our relationship with the local government?"

"The relationship is not bad, but not deep," Wen Tong explained their recent dealings with the yamen, including matters of rectifying the sugar factory and maintaining order. "...In general, there isn't much contact."

"I think there will be more soon," Chen Tianxiong said with a smile. "Even a blind man can see that you are making a fortune now. There will be no shortage of trouble in the future."

"Yes, I'm worried about that too," Wen Tong said with concern. "Although the Qiwei Escort Agency has prepared a certain foundation for us, their roots are also very shallow. They may not be able to handle some things."

"If it really comes to it, we can just pay for peace," Chang Shide said. "How about giving the officials some dry shares? A protective umbrella. Fortunately, in two years, Leizhou will be ours."

"Do your best to drag the local officials into the water and form a community of interests." This was the directive given by the Executive Committee to all transmigrators operating in the Ming territory.

"That's possible," Wen Tong nodded. "But we still need to report the specific plan to the Executive Committee. Speaking of which, it's too inconvenient here. We don't even have a radio. Even a place like Yanchang Village has a 5W radio."

"The Executive Committee will probably equip you with a radio soon. Mass production of radios is just around the corner. The glass factory has been experimenting with drawing glass tubes every day, and Dr. Zhong is already working on it," Chen Tianxiong said.

"Building radios?" Wen Tong was skeptical. "Isn't that too high-tech?"

"He wants to build a lot of high-tech things: clocks, batteries, and water-gas airships. I don't think the airship is very reliable, but we can just listen to him brag."

"I've argued with him about that airship before. It's completely unrealistic. Dr. Zhong has read too many books and is a bit idealistic," Chang Shide said dismissively.

"If he can build it, he should first get us a vacuum pan, and a centrifuge," Wen Tong's only thought was his sugar.

"It probably won't be difficult for him. By the way, I heard that he wanted me to bring you a message: Xuwen is very rich in diatomaceous earth, even more so than Lingao. You can use it for filtering when making white sugar."

"Really? Then I'll have to have someone look for it. The efficiency of using yellow mud water is terrible right now," Wen Tong was energized by the news. "If we continue like this, the labor cost for a ton of white sugar will be too high."

The price of raw sugar was much lower than white sugar. Processing it into white sugar and then selling it was much more profitable. Wen Tong had been racking his brains recently to see if he could come up with a white sugar process that was within their capabilities but had higher processing efficiency. The raw sugar in the warehouse was piling up. In the past, without steel rollers, the average yield of raw sugar per mu of sugarcane was about three dan. Now that the juice extraction rate had been increased, the yield per mu was over five dan. The sugarcane fields under the South China Factory alone could produce 13,000 dan of raw sugar. Adding the processing fees from processing for others, the raw sugar in the warehouse was piling up like a mountain, totaling over 20,000 dan. The output of the white sugar workshop, working two shifts 24 hours a day, was only five or six dan.

As they were talking, Wen Xiu suddenly came to report: a pigeon from Guangzhou had arrived with a secret letter.

Chang Shide sent him out, took out a codebook from the room, and began to decode. The others watched him eagerly. A few minutes later, Chang Shide said happily, "Zhang Xin wrote that we should ship out all the sugar in stock as soon as possible, including the raw sugar. The market is quite good: the price in Guangzhou is three taels and eight qian, and it looks like it will rise! He said if we can acquire more, we should. We can exchange it for silver in Guangzhou!"

"Great," Wen Tong was very enthusiastic. "I heard from Liao Dahua that the purchase price on Haian Street is only two taels and five qian!"

Chang Shide said, "Then we'll buy it at three taels!" Everyone laughed. The feeling of making a huge profit was indeed good.

Wen Tong said with a smile, "If he hadn't written, I would have written to ask what to do with all this sugar. A few sugar merchants on Haian Street have approached us to buy our sugar. I hesitated and didn't agree to sell. Fortunately, I didn't sell, otherwise, we would have lost a lot!"

Chang Shide said, "In that case, we'll have to go to them to buy!"

"That's out of the question. They know the market in Guangzhou better than we do. Hmph!" Wen Tong didn't seem to have a good impression of these sugar merchants.

"Who cares? This place will be ours in the future," Chang Shide said, opening the door and calling for Wen Xiu. "Go and ask Manager Liao to come here."

For the past month, they had been trying to find a manager familiar with the sugar business locally to handle the factory's external affairs. They had specifically asked Liao Dahua to accompany them to Haian Street and the county town to see if there were any managers willing to switch jobs, but to no avail. No one was willing to jump ship, and more people expressed confusion: you are a sugar mill, what do you need a sugar merchant's manager for?

Thus, Liao Dahua became their only external agent in the area. For convenience, Liao Dahua simply moved into the courtyard of the South China Factory. It was less than two or three li from the county town, so if there was anything to handle at the escort agency's branch, he could go back immediately.

Liao Dahua came to the study. Bei Wei didn't want to be seen too much and hid in the side room. Wen Tong told Liao Dahua about their plan to purchase a large amount of raw sugar. He wanted him to set up a team—even without a sugar merchant's manager, they were planning to do it themselves.

But Liao Dahua shook his head repeatedly. "Master, this is not appropriate."

"What's not appropriate?"

"Master, you don't know," Liao Dahua said. "The sugar in Leizhou has always been purchased by the sugar merchants on Haian Street..."

"He buys his, I buy mine. It has nothing to do with each other," Wen Tong found it strange.

But Chang Shide understood. "They have a monopoly, right?"

"Exactly," Liao Dahua said. There were a total of twenty-one sugar merchants on Haian Street, forming a sugar guild called "Haiyitang." All the sugar produced in Leizhou for export had to pass through their hands. The purchase price of sugar each year was decided by the guild before the scales were opened. Outsiders who did not join the "Haiyitang" could not engage in the business of purchasing raw sugar.

"So that's how it is," Wen Tong nodded. This kind of monopoly organization really exists everywhere.

"That's strange. Why can't we get involved? On what grounds?" Chang Shide was very unconvinced.

"This..." Liao Dahua had never thought about why it was not allowed. The sugar merchants on Haian Street had monopolized the export of Leizhou sugar for decades, and everyone regarded it as a normal state of affairs. "Masters, you don't know. The cane farmers originally didn't have large ships and couldn't transport the sugar themselves. So they entrusted the sugar to these sugar merchants to sell on their behalf in other places. After the sale, the sugar merchants would settle the accounts with the cane farmers. The sugar merchants would settle at ninety-eight percent, taking a two percent commission. Over time, because of the risks of sea transport, such as sinking and robbery, and the occasional embezzlement by the sugar merchants, it gradually became the current system of cash purchase. The sugar merchants earn more, but the cane farmers are also willing—after all, they take on great risks."

"So that's how it is. It's nothing," Wen Tong said. "We can also take these risks. We'll start preparing tomorrow and open the scales to buy sugar in a few days!"

Liao Dahua's lips moved as if he wanted to persuade them further. Chang Shide said with a smile, "It's just a little business, what's the big deal? How about this, we'll also give the Qiwei Escort Agency a two percent commission on the sugar we purchase."

Two percent was not a small amount. Not only would it be a great benefit to the escort agency, but he himself would also get a considerable share. Thinking of the wealth and generosity of these Australian merchants, Liao Dahua's courage grew. He replied, "Since the masters have made up their minds, I will go and do it. I know a little about the sugar business. I'll go and prepare now!" He then took his leave.

But Chen Tianxiong said, "Isn't this a bit risky? Have you considered their counterattack?"

"It's fine," Wen Tong said. "I've been to Haian Street and met a few managers. The sugar merchants are all legitimate businesses. In fact, they manage the entire Haian Street, and it's very orderly."

Chen Tianxiong shook his head. "Old Wen, it's not that I'm being nosy—this is your jurisdiction, but you should know: interest groups have always been ruthless in protecting their interests. Not selling sugar to the sugar merchants and shipping it out yourselves is already a taboo. Now you are also buying sugar. This conflict of interest is almost a matter of life and death."

"Is it that exaggerated?" Wen Tong was skeptical.

"You've been around the block," Chen Tianxiong said. "Do you really think the 17th century was a time of simple folk and honest living? Which of the evils of society hasn't existed since ancient times? Merchants chase profits. I don't need to recite Marx's evaluation of capitalists to you, do I?"

"What do you think we should do?" Wen Tong thought what he said made sense. The idea that ancient people were simple and honest, he had already learned from his time here, was not necessarily true. The people of this time were the same as modern people: there were good people, bad people, and more who were just silent, neither particularly good nor bad to the core.

Bei Wei rarely spoke, but he did now, "Chen Tianxiong's point should be considered. What if the other side counterattacks?"

"Before our wings are fully grown, it's best not to touch this cake," Chen Tianxiong suggested.

"I don't think we need to be so nervous," Chang Shide said after considering for a long time. "The sugar merchants on Haian Street are just ordinary merchants. What can they do? At most, they have a better relationship with the county and prefecture yamen. We now have connections in Guangzhou, and we can talk to the Leizhou prefecture yamen and the Haikang and Xuwen county yamen. What can they do to me?"

After a round of discussion, Chen Tianxiong saw that they had made up their minds. Since he was not part of the decision-making level of the South China Factory, saying more would be overstepping his bounds and would not be conducive to his future work, so he no longer insisted. He only reminded them to be prepared to deal with the situation. Bei Wei was not interested in these things and had been silent all along. Bored, he looked at the ever-growing pile of bagasse outside the courtyard wall and suddenly asked, "What do you do with the by-products of sugar production?"

"There are many uses, but we need equipment. Speaking of which, I was also thinking of reporting this to the Executive Committee. We need to be allocated some fermentation equipment and strains," Wen Tong explained the recycling of sugarcane by-products. Strictly speaking, there was no waste in the sugar industry; even the wastewater could be used to produce things.

By diluting the molasses and adding different strains of bacteria, they could produce alcohol, glycerin, acetone, butanol, citric acid, and yeast. Bagasse could be used to make paper and furfural. Sucrose wax could be extracted from the filter mud, and the rest could be used as fertilizer. As for the sugarcane itself, the leaves could be used as fodder. The head and tail of the sugarcane had low sugar content and were cut off before entering the press, but even with less sugar, they could still be used to brew wine or extract alcohol.

"These are actually relatively simple recycling methods. Bagasse can also be used to recover aconitic acid," Wen Tong said. "The extent to which we can utilize it depends on how many strains and chemical products we have, and also on the necessary equipment."

"The things that the South China Factory can use on the spot are probably using molasses to make alcohol and using bagasse to make paper, right?" Chang Shide said.

"Making paper is impossible," Wen Tong had recently investigated the fuel situation of the boiler. "All the bagasse is barely enough to fuel the fire."

"That's such a waste..."

"Then we'll have to buy coal to fire the boiler. To be honest, I'd rather use coal to fire the boiler. The moisture content of the bagasse is too high. If it weren't for the cheap labor here, the labor cost of drying the bagasse every day would be enough to bankrupt us," Wen Tong said. "Industrialization is good, but it also consumes a lot. I'm now doubting whether the bagasse is even enough to last until the end of the harvest season."

Buying coal was certainly possible. It wasn't far to buy coal from Hon Gai in Vietnam. And Gaozhou was not far from Leizhou, where there was a large coal mining area in Guangdong Province, which is now the Maoming mining area. However, this mining area was only sporadically mined in the Ming Dynasty. It could be used as a supplementary fuel source. At least it was much shorter than shipping coal from Guangzhou.

"Then let's set up a coal shop," Chang Shide's mind worked quickly. "Few people here use coal; most still burn firewood. If we introduce coal for our own use, we might even be able to do some business."

"Sure, it won't cost much anyway. We can just have Qiwei do it."
