It turned out they were the spoils of a recent raid on a pirate stronghold in Haikang County. The men, regardless of age, had been executed as pirates on the spot. The "pirate dependents" who hadn't escaped were divided among the government troops and local militia. The rest were handed over to the county for official sale.

Because they were "pirate dependents," most people were reluctant to get involved. Despite the low price, there were few buyers. After a week, only half had been sold.

Chang Shide, seeing that the women were in good physical condition, bought the entire lot for a package deal of ten taels of silver. Liao Dahua, observing this, thought to himself that his master's tastes were truly… unconventional.

Having made his purchase, Chang Shide lost all interest in further sightseeing and announced his return. The unfortunate "pirate dependents" trailed slowly behind his sedan chair.

Wen Tong was surprised to see Chang Shide return with a retinue of five or six raggedly dressed women. He had heard Chang Shide mention buying maids, but he hadn't considered it an urgent matter. He certainly hadn't expected him to return with five of them, ranging in age from young girls to mature women.

As the procession entered the plantation, the women, with a practiced consciousness of their new status, lined up against the wall. When Chang Shide emerged from his sedan chair, they all knelt in unison. *So, you're into S&M, you little rascal,* Wen Tong thought.

"Not bad, eh?" Chang Shide's face was aglow. "Only ten taels of silver!"

Wen Tong sighed. "And where is this expense coming from? You only have coupons. Is this not a case of using public funds for private gain?"

"Of course not," Chang Shide said nonchalantly. "We were authorized to purchase people. Consider it for… domestic services. Cooking, cleaning, that sort of thing."

"Alright," Wen Tong relented, "but their 'purification' is on you. I have a sugar factory to run."

With the company leadership's blessing, Chang Shide was suddenly a very busy man. Liao Dahua, ever accommodating, was happy to assist. Both were ordinary men with a shared licentious streak, though Liao Dahua had some reservations about Chang Shide's aesthetic choices. First, all the women had unbound feet. Second, they were all, in his eyes, a bit too sturdy. Liao Dahua preferred the frail, flat-chested type.

"Get up, all of you," Chang Shide said. No one understood his Mandarin. Liao Dahua quickly translated. The women hesitated, then rose. Chang Shide had intended to take them into his room for a more… intimate inspection, but the stench that wafted from them, even at a distance of ten feet, reminded him that a bath was a more pressing need. Their matted, rope-like hair was clearly a haven for parasites.

He suppressed his desire to inspect his new acquisitions and summoned Wen Xiu.

"Take them to the bathing area and give them a thorough washing," he ordered. He paused. "You've been through the 'purification' training, haven't you?"

"Yes, I have," Wen Xiu replied. He had endured the same ordeal and had been trained in the process before being selected as their servant.

"Follow the procedure exactly. But we don't have a doctor—"

"No problem," Liao Dahua interjected. "There are physicians in the county. I will fetch two of them."

Chang Shide wondered about the competence of these herbal doctors. The women were pirate dependents; he worried about venereal diseases. "Get one who specializes in venereal diseases," he added.

"There is an old physician in the county who is an expert in this field. He once treated the garrison commander. They call him 'Old Army Doctor.' I will get him."

"Good. Bring the Old Army Doctor."

With that, Chang Shide retired to his room to bathe and rest. He awoke to find the sun setting. He emerged from his room and was startled by a row of shaved heads under the eaves. It was the five women, standing against the wall. Their uniform cotton clothes and shiny, bald heads indicated that their "purification" was complete.

At the sight of their new master, the women all knelt. The feeling was quite pleasant for Chang Shide, who had long been oppressed by his wife and had occasionally "volunteered" as her punching bag. He reaffirmed his decision not to bring his wife along as an act of pure genius.

Hearing the commotion, Wen Xiu hurried over. "Master is awake," he said respectfully. "The purification is complete."

"Good." Chang Shide examined the bowed, shaved heads and felt a pang of regret. He should have specified that they not be shaved bald. A short haircut and a good wash would have sufficed. How could their bald heads possibly arouse his interest? But he couldn't bring himself to say it. With a straight face, he asked, "Has the doctor examined them?"

Sensing his master's displeasure, Wen Xiu became even more cautious. "Yes, the physicians have examined them. The women are all clean. The deworming medicine has been prepared and administered. The Old Army Doctor was particularly eager to please and also prescribed some formulas for women's health and vitality. Should I have the medicine prepared?" He produced a few sheets of paper from his sleeve.

"Of course. The Executive Committee's—" Chang Shide stopped himself. He had been about to say that the Committee's money was for spending, but he realized how that would sound.

"And the Old Army Doctor also sent a package of… secret medicine for you, Master. He asks that you accept it. He says it is very effective."

Chang Shide knew this "secret medicine" was some kind of aphrodisiac. Whether it worked or not was irrelevant. Consuming such dubious substances was a fool's game. "I don't want it. Throw it away," he said with disgust. "By the way, did they get the 'Three Whites Soup'?"

"'Three Whites Soup'?" Wen Xiu was taken aback. "No, but the physicians have not yet left. I will have them prescribe it at once."

"Quickly, then."

Wen Xiu tactfully withdrew.

*I wonder if the Three Whites Soup will have any effect on their skin color,* Chang Shide mused, looking at their dark complexions. It didn't affect their practical use, but he had a preference for fairer women.

He decided to properly inspect them. At the market, he had only given them a cursory glance. They had been so disheveled and dirty that he couldn't make out any details.

"Get up, all of you." The women didn't understand his words, but they understood his gestures and obediently rose.

They were, he was pleased to discover, quite in line with "modern" aesthetic tastes. Unbound feet, for one. And their height—except for the young girl, the shortest was around 152 centimeters, the tallest over 160. Most were well-muscled. Tall, sturdy women were a rarity in this region.

He hadn't expected much in terms of looks, just hoping they wouldn't be too "East Asian-featured." He had no interest in the stereotypical small eyes, flat nose, and high cheekbones. Now, he saw that while they weren't beauties, they weren't "mangoes" either. Two had the distinct features of the Guangdong and Fujian regions, while another had the long face and prominent nose of a northern Han Chinese.

Years of outdoor labor had left them with dark skin, even after bathing. It was unavoidable. Pirate dependents were not sheltered ladies. They had likely toiled under the harsh southern sun.

He chose the tallest woman, whose skin seemed slightly fairer, and reached into her collar. She flinched but stood stiffly as he conducted his hands-on survey. Her skin was surprisingly smooth, much better than the weathered skin of her face. Her figure was better than he had imagined. He had had low expectations for her breasts but was pleasantly surprised to find she was at least a C-cup. Her muscles were firm, her waist slender, her hips large. In any era, she would be considered "good for childbearing." He decided to claim her for himself. Thinking of Wen Xiu's earlier attempt at seduction, a wicked idea came to him. "You shall be called A'Xiu."

He measured the other women, except for the little girl, and named them A'Zhu, A'Zi, and A'Bi, after characters from a novel he'd been reading. The little girl was simply named A'Luo.

When he was done, he summoned Wen Xiu. "From now on, you will teach them Mandarin." Though their primary duty was physical, some communication was necessary—discussing positions, for example.

"Yes, I will teach them well," Wen Xiu agreed readily, knowing that tending to the master's women was a quick path to favor.

"Are any of them related?"

"No, Master. They are not even from the same place."

"What about A'Luo?"

"She lived with her brother. He went missing during the raid. She is alone now."

"Master, where should these women be housed?"

"Put them in the east wing, with the two scullery maids."

As they spoke, A'Luo, who had been standing silently, suddenly fainted, collapsing to the ground without a sound.

"What happened?" Chang Shide exclaimed.

The other women didn't dare to speak. "She fainted from hunger," Wen Xiu said. "They haven't eaten since they arrived."

"You idiot! Why didn't you feed them?"

"You ordered, Master, that they be presented to you first. After the purification, I brought them here, but you were napping. I dared not disturb you."

"Never mind. Get them some food. It's not good if they starve." As a 21st-century man, Chang Shide, while enjoying the life of a slave owner, still had some basic concept of human rights.

Wen Xiu hurried off and returned with two maids carrying a pot of hot congee and pickles.

"Everyone, eat. Eat slowly."

The women, who had been trembling at their master's anger, were now faced with his smiling face and were at a loss. But the congee was an immense temptation. They gathered around, sitting on the stone steps, and the courtyard filled with the sound of slurping. They ate with a gusto that spoke volumes about the Ming government's treatment of its captives. Chang Shide made a mental note to improve their nutrition.

He designated A'Zhu, the best-looking of the group, as Wen Tong's maid. A'Xiu, A'Bi, and A'Zi he shamelessly claimed for himself. The thought of having his own team filled him with a sense of pride. He, who had eagerly awaited a "life secretary" in Lingao, now felt his decision to come to Leizhou was an act of pure genius. *Who needs a life secretary? I'm not interested in that anymore.*

He began to consider how to cultivate his new team. Some should learn to cook, others to read. All would have to learn various life service skills, like massage. As for the more… professional skills, it was a pity there was no electricity. He would have to teach them himself, through practice. The women trained this way, hehe…

Wen Xiu and the women watched their master standing alone, his face blank, his eyes shining, occasionally letting out a silly laugh, a trickle of drool at the corner of his mouth. They were scared. "Master—" Wen Xiu called out, fearing he was having a fit.

"Ah, oh, it's nothing." Chang Shide returned to his senses. "Also, teach them your set of serving skills!"

"Yes, I understand."

That night, Chang Shide lay in bed, reliving the inspection of the women's bodies. The more he replayed it, the more aroused he became. Their faces appeared in his mind, their shaved heads no longer a deterrent to the rising of a certain organ.

"Wen Xiu!" he called out.

Wen Xiu ran in.

"Go and bring A'Xiu here!"
