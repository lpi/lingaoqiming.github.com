"Didn't I say it already? If we're short on coal, send the barges to transport it," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said impatiently at the meeting. "With a carrying capacity of 1500 tons, even a shipment from Vietnam would be enough to last a few months, right?"

"Easier said than done. Vietnam has its own imperial court."

"The Later Le Dynasty, I believe."

"A monkey in a crown—" Xi Yazhou expressed his contempt. "We might as well send an expeditionary force to wipe them out."

"Don't say that. The 'monkeys' are still quite fierce at this time. It would be a bit tiring for our small force to take them on," Yu E'shui said. "In places with established, stable government institutions, we can't mess around like the Europeans did in Black Africa. Our only option is to trade with them."

"Then it must be unequal trade—" Xi Yazhou was suddenly filled with nationalistic passion. "Where there are cannons, there is trade."

"Alright, alright, let's not get too sidetracked," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] interrupted Xi Yazhou's outburst. "Next, I want to discuss the issue of the army."

After their victory in the first anti-encirclement campaign and the subsequent annihilation of the Gou family, the transmigrators had opened up the situation in Lingao, winning a period of peaceful development. However, they had to be soberly aware that as more time passed since their landing and their actions grew bolder, they would inevitably draw attention from all sides. Both the pirates and the Ming Dynasty were expected to take action against the transmigrators in the near future. Therefore, he requested that the committee and all transmigrators promptly establish a new army and a complete training and combat system.

In the medium to long term, the core combat force of the transmigrators would necessarily be a new-style army composed mainly of natives of this time-space, whether it was called the "New Army" or the "Native Army," the core idea was the same. The transmigrators' extreme weakness in human resources meant that even if they all served as administrative officials and technical personnel, they would still be stretched thin, let alone serve as soldiers in battle.

The existing army, primarily composed of transmigrators, had to be disbanded and reorganized into the New Army. The number of personnel currently serving long-term in the military group already exceeded 10% of the total number of transmigrators. These individuals, who possessed modern technology and ideas, were engaged in a large amount of patrols, guard duties, and small-scale combat, which was a serious waste of human resources.

The proposed new army—[Ma Qianzhu][y005] suggested calling it the "New Army" rather than something like "Native Army" to distinguish it from future, lower-tier forces—would have its soldiers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) be Ming people. As the army expanded, the future officer corps would also be dominated by Ming people.

The recruits for the New Army would mainly come from peasants and former soldiers, especially the common military households under the Weisuo system. After training, they would serve as the primary NCOs. The officer corps of the New Army would initially be composed of transmigrators, gradually supplemented by military academy cadets. Therefore, a rebel army military academy should be established as soon as possible. The initial cadets for the academy would be local scholars (Tongsheng) and literate soldiers. In the early stages, the military academy could be co-located and run jointly with the schools for administrative officials and technicians. If conditions did not permit this, a training brigade model could be used for officer training.

The New Army would operate under a system of single-commander responsibility, but soldiers' committees would be organized at every level. These committees would have the right to object to officers' orders that were not related to combat. If the commanding officer insisted, the order must be obeyed, but the soldiers' committee would have the right to appeal to a higher-ranking commander or even to the transmigrators' military department. A committee member could not be executed before a review by the military department, even on the front lines. Mistreatment of soldiers would be severely punished.

The New Army would implement a professional soldier system. Officers and soldiers would enjoy employee benefits, including preferential housing allocation and private plots of land, and free use of new crop varieties (other farmers using new crop varieties would have an additional tax the following year). In fact, the manpower for the New Army would come from the labor saved by the new crops.

"On that, I'd like to offer an opinion," He Ming said. "I don't know much about the Ming army. But when an army doesn't fight for a long time, it often develops many bad habits. Our troops had a lot of problems before we fought Vietnam in '79. Are the soldiers from a typical old-style army like the Ming's really up to snuff? Won't we just end up recruiting a bunch of army scoundrels?"

"You're from the PLA yourself," Zhang Bolin interjected. "Have you forgotten the invincible power of political work? Weren't the 'liberated soldiers' back then from old armies like the KMT's? They were all reformed just the same."

"Can you even do political work?" He Ming expressed his doubt about Zhang Bolin's words.

"Don't worry, I'll definitely handle it," Zhang Bolin said, full of confidence.

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] said, "He Ming has a point. We don't have much time to change their thinking. We need to be more selective when it comes to personnel from the old armies."

"We'll send our own people to serve as grassroots officers. If we start off right, once we put on the 'three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention' as a tight hoop, the morale will naturally correct itself," Xi Yazhou recalled his experience training the militia in Yanchang Village. "...If the commander himself acts uprightly and sets an example in everything, the lower-level leaders won't dare to act recklessly. What's the old saying? One righteous presence can suppress a hundred evils."

"Recruiting from military households is probably unreliable," said Yu E'shui. "The military households of the late Ming were not much different from commoners, basically tenant farmers for the officers, and most of them were old, weak, sick, or disabled."

"But they have deep grievances," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said. "In Lingao's case, the military households suffer much more than the common people. The tenant farmers and long-term laborers here have a much better life than them."

"Recruit soldiers from the Li people. They are in the mountains and can form mountain infantry," Wei Aiwen began to promote his idea of a Li unit again. He had been frequently trading in the Li areas recently and had established some emotional foundation with the locals, for which he had consumed a considerable number of his privately brought lighters.

"Recruiting Miao people would be better than recruiting Li people," Yu E'shui reminded him. "There is deep ethnic conflict between the Li and the Han here. We can only resolve it gradually and cannot easily arm them. With good weapons in hand, their courage will grow. If something happens with this Li armed force, we'll be like Zhu Bajie looking in a mirror—in a double bind."

The Miao people of Hainan were descendants of the Miao troops who came to Hainan with the Ming army from Guangxi to suppress a major Li rebellion and were subsequently disbanded on the spot. Because they arrived late, they could only settle in the high mountains, mostly working as long-term laborers or tenant farmers for Li chieftains and Han landlords. Some lived purely by hunting. Their lives were even harder than those of the Li. Historically, the relationship between the Miao and the Han in Hainan was relatively good.

"Are there Miao people locally?"

"Yes, yes," Wei Aiwen said quickly. "Chief Zhu of Nan Dong said there's a Miao village not far from them, with about a hundred households. If needed, we can make a trip to scout the way."

"Recruiting Li and Miao people can be considered," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] thought for a moment. Recruiting a few dozen men to form a reconnaissance team or something similar should still be controllable.

"Next, I'll talk about the control of the army," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] continued.

The army is a tool of the transmigrators, and a tool must not turn against its master. Therefore, the current independent operation of the military department must be changed. Once the New Army is established, a new military system must be put on the agenda. And when the New Army exceeds 500 men, outnumbering the transmigrators, it must be controlled by effective means. Therefore, he made the following recommendations.

At the beginning of the New Army's establishment, the original personnel of the military group must be preserved to serve as trainers and supervisors for the new force. Establishing the New Army requires officers, so a method of halving the size will be adopted. 20 men will be retained as an internal guard force, equipped with modern weapons. The other 30 will enter the New Army as officers to establish a training battalion.

Once the New Army system is perfected, the mission of the armed forces directly controlled by the military department will end. Except for the internal guard, all other personnel will be integrated into the New Army's sequence. All future military operations will be executed by the New Army.

The New Army will mainly use 19th-century weapons and cold weapons. The initial decision is to use muzzle-loading rifles with Minie balls and pikes, with a provisional gun-to-pike ratio of 1:1. The first batch of the New Army will be 500 men, organized into one battalion, plus one artillery company equipped with 9 smoothbore cannons. If new weapons are needed in combat, an application can be made to the Committee, and they will be issued by the internal guard.

A General Staff will be established under the Military Committee, with separate Army and Navy systems under it. The General Staff will have the authority to command the Army and Navy, but not the internal guard. The Military Committee will be responsible for the training and supply of the internal guard but will have no jurisdiction or command authority over it, which will be directly controlled by the Executive Committee.

The army cannot be used in internal conflicts. The main tasks of the internal guard are to maintain order, protect government agencies and important materials, and control modern weapons.

An independent military intelligence department will be established under the General Staff, responsible for military intelligence collection and reconnaissance activities.

For military logistics, no independent department will be established for the time being. The Executive Committee will entrust various professional departments with supply, and the Planning Committee will control specific allocations.

The militia program already implemented in Damei Village and Yanchang Village must be continued and expanded, not only in these two villages but also in the Bairen Commune. In the early stages, a core militia system will be adopted, with one in every three able-bodied men drafted. Transmigrators will go to the villages to conduct rotational training for the core militia. The militia's weapons will currently consist mainly of captured cold weapons, old-style firearms, jingals, and standard 6-pound smoothbore cannons. Once we have a certain industrial capacity, the core militia can be equipped with Minie rifles.

The Transmigrator Group has no formal naval combat force, only fishing trawlers for patrols—and the use of these modern trawlers must be controlled as much as possible due to fuel and spare parts limitations. Given that the pirates of this era are the most powerful combat force in the southeast region, and it currently seems difficult to cooperate with them, a naval base should be built and fortified at Bopu in the short term. The Army should support the construction of naval fortress artillery and station a defensive force at the naval base. The Navy will establish a battery at Cape Lingao to control the harbor entrance and protect the port and shipyard construction.

Hearing this, Zhang Bolin blinked, as if to say, "You can act all high and mighty, but you'll still have to come to me begging for cannons."

After the establishment of the Navy, the original Fishery Production Group will be abolished and merged into the Navy. Fishery production will remain one of the Navy's main tasks at this stage. Therefore, the Navy will be under the dual leadership of the General Staff and the Agricultural Committee. The Bopu Fish Processing Plant will remain under the ownership of the Agricultural Committee. The Navy's personnel will be recruited and trained by the Army, and will later become an independent system.

To unify maritime forces in the initial stage and avoid multi-headed management, a system of "everything that floats on the sea belongs to the Navy" will be implemented. All vessels, whether brought from the other time-space or captured or purchased locally, regardless of their current use, will be managed by the Navy.
