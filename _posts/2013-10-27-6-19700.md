Among the dead outside the villa, there were only three bodies of any significance. Two were monks, one local and one from out of town, both invited by Zhang Guang. They were claimed by the local temples, and there was nothing suspicious about them.

The remaining body belonged to a scholar named Cao Guangjiu. According to the yamen runners, this man was a "worn-out boot," a notorious ruffian in the suburbs who specialized in monopolizing lawsuits, usury, and getting involved in all sorts of shady business.

Comparing this with the kill records from the Ghost Festival, it was confirmed that this Cao Guangjiu was one of the leaders targeted by the snipers that night.

The Zhan Gan Chu used its connections within the yamen to conduct a thorough examination of Cao Guangjiu's body beforehand, confiscating all personal items of interest.

Cao Guangjiu didn't have many belongings. Besides some silver, there was only a scented sachet commonly used in summer, a folding fan, and a personal leisure sealâ€”all common trinkets for a scholar of that era.

"...The main thing is the fan. The signature on it is 'Nong Shi Sou...'"

Zhao Yigong's eyelids twitched. "Are you saying this fan was a gift from 'Shi Weng'?"

"It's highly likely."

Zhao Yigong pondered. The successful assassination on the night of the Ghost Festival had, to some extent, silenced a key witness for the enemy. However, with this fan and the knowledge of Cao Guangjiu's identity, they were one step closer to finding the mastermind.

"Then there are the three people who died at Hao Yuan's stronghold," Zhao Tong said.

Although these three were found with nothing on them, the former escort agency members of the Zhan Gan Chu were able to determine from the calluses on their hands and feet, the scars on their bodies, and a series of other features that all three were martial artists, and likely worked for an escort agency.

"The cause of death for all of them was poisoning..."

"Poisoning?" Zhao Yigong was startled.

"Yes, it seems they were silenced," Zhao Tong said. "They probably weren't with Hao Yuan, but were sent by that Shi Weng..."

Considering that the Zhan Gan Chu's several attempts to tail Hao Yuan had all been intercepted by escort agency personnel, it was highly probable that these three were the very escorts who had previously blocked the Zhan Gan Chu and secretly protected Hao Yuan's movements.

*Ruthless,* Zhao Yigong thought. With this move, Hao Yuan had completely severed all ties with "Shi Weng." Even if they could find Shi Weng, they wouldn't get any information about Hao Yuan's whereabouts.

Since the three bodies were "unclaimed," the Zhan Gan Chu, under the pretext of the Cihuitang "burying unclaimed corpses," took possession of them and conducted a detailed examination.

A major clue was discovered on their clothing. The boots worn by all three men were made by a famous shoe shop in the capital.

"How did you recognize them?"

"These boots are only made at that one shop in the capital. They have a great reputation among martial artists, and the escorts from the capital's agencies are particularly fond of wearing them."

"So they are from a capital escort agency."

"Yes. We have already taken photos of the three men. The Intelligence Bureau has approved our request for the Beijing station to help us investigate their specific identities and social connections."

"Very good." Zhao Yigong nodded in approval. "Use all resources to find Hao Yuan for me. And step up the investigation on the fan's clue."

Zhao Manxiong carefully, slowly pushed aside the file he was pretending to read, and slowly rose from his desk to pace around the office. He stood by the window, watching the sparrows in the courtyard. Although Lingao's ecosystem was being destroyed at an ever-increasing rate, the natural environment was still much better than in the 21st century. There were many birds.

These sparrows were not afraid of people and came to the streets and courtyards of Bairen City to forage every day. After three years of a difficult march, the Elders' living standards had greatly improved. They no longer saw every living thing as walking or flying meat. The sparrows' living environment had naturally improved significantly as well.

Watching the sparrows foraging unhurriedly easily induced a sense of empty weariness. He silently took a drag from his cigar, turned around, looked at Wu Mu, then returned to his desk, nodded towards the file, and asked, "What do you think of this matter?"

"This matter is unusual, so I must verify its reliability from multiple sources."

"Who did you verify this information with? Is it reliable?"

"Completely reliable. I verified it through the Ten-Man Group members stationed at the Hangzhou station. In addition, before this matter was formally raised, the Hangzhou station's security department and the Ten-Man Group members had also submitted related reports, though they were rather fragmented."

"Thank you very much."

He pulled the report in front of him. It was labeled "Top Secret, Single Copy, Elders Only." He skimmed through it again. The report was written by Zhao Yigong. It was messy and disorganized, but the general meaning was clear: the Hangzhou station had discovered a suspected transmigrator. His behavior and words seemed to indicate that he came from the same time and space as the Elders. Zhao Yigong requested the Senate to conduct a special investigation and take decisive action to prevent future trouble.

The report had been delivered by a special courier, opened by the General Office, circulated among the Executive Committee, and then sent directly to the Political Security Bureau.

Obviously, the report had not yet been brought to the Senate Standing Committee, but it wouldn't be long. Once the report reached the Senate Standing Committee, the whole affair would inevitably cause a huge uproar in the Senate.

Naturally, Zhao Yigong's scheme was to use this to cover up the mess at the Hangzhou station. By muddying the waters, everything would be easier to explain.

However, in terms of severity, this was indeed the number one national security incident at the moment.

Zhao Manxiong was silent, pacing the office for a long time. Then he stood in front of Wu Mu and asked, "In your opinion," he nodded at the desk, "is this matter related to 'Incident A'?"

"It's hard to say, very hard to say, Comrade Zhao Manxiong."

"Why?"

"We have now fully investigated the American shipwreck on Dongsha Island. However, according to the information provided by Lando, none of the people on that ship match Hao Yuan's description."

Of the people on the ship, the German was already dead, and his body had been found. Lando was now an Elder. The only ones unaccounted for were Hale and two Southeast Asian sailors. They had a composite sketch of Hale provided by Lando: a middle-aged, sturdy man. Not a young man like Hao Yuan, and Hao Yuan did not have Southeast Asian features.

This meant that Hao Yuan was not from the American shipwreck, unless Lando had concealed the presence of others on board.

"Do you think Lando could be deceiving us?"

"No, I don't think so." Wu Mu shook his head. "Besides, I don't think it's appropriate for us to suspect an Elder..."

"Whether it's appropriate or not is best left for the Otaku Party to discuss. So you believe Lando was honest until he left Lingao for Manila. Is that right, Comrade Wu Mu?" Zhao Manxiong shifted his bulky frame, leaning against the desk. He scrutinized Wu Mu's face, as if trying to embrace him with his eyes.

"Yes, I believe so." Wu Mu shifted uncomfortably. His leather Sam Browne belt creaked.

"Alright. We believe the Elders are reliable. So where did this Hao Yuan come from?"

"Perhaps there are other transmigrators like us in this world..."

"What you say is very interesting. That is indeed one of the reasonable explanations." Zhao Manxiong stroked his chin.

"We now have someone who has had contact with him. The Xihua mentioned in the report is already on her way to Lingao. I think we can confirm whether Hao Yuan is a transmigrator by interrogating her. Once she arrives, the truth will be revealed."

"No, I don't think it's that simple. Unless we can capture Hao Yuan himself. Otherwise, someone who has had little contact with him is unlikely to provide us with any crucial testimony. You mustn't forget. Besides being a transmigrator himself, Hao Yuan could also be someone associated with a transmigrator."

Indeed, that would link Hao Yuan to Hale. But Wu Mu felt it was a bit of a stretch. Why couldn't Hao Yuan be an independent transmigrator?

"Why can't he be an independent transmigrator?"

"Intuition," Zhao Manxiong said with a smile.

*What kind of reason is that! Just being mysterious.* Wu Mu cursed inwardly. He knew his expression would betray him, so he didn't hide it. "Isn't that a bit far-fetched..."

"No, not at all. Because it is currently the most likely explanation." Zhao Manxiong said, "Although we don't have first-hand information on Hao Yuan, from the intelligence we have gathered so far, his methods, style, and so on all show that he is an ambitious and capable person. He hasn't been in Hangzhou for long, yet he has already established a considerable presence. This shows that he has significant resources at his disposal."

"You're right, Comrade Zhao Manxiong."

"Alright, let's go back to your point: a lone transmigrator." Zhao Manxiong stubbed out the cigar that was about to burn his fingers in the ashtray. "We already know that a lone transmigrator, as long as they have real skills and enough luck, can survive in this time and space, and even live well. Mr. Lando is an example. However, to build something from scratch is very, very difficult. Since Zhao Yigong said that Hao Yuan doesn't run any businesses in Hangzhou and lives an almost ascetic life, yet has a large amount of resources to command, it means that there is a considerable force supporting him."

"Are you saying that Hao Yuan might be connected to Hale in Manila, that Hao Yuan is a pawn sent by Hale?"

Zhao Manxiong nodded. "Comrade Wu Mu, we must get used to connecting the various black threads that emerge. Only then can we quickly figure out the enemy's plots and schemes. If you just recall the recent cases we've handled, you'll know that Hale's hand has already reached into China. You can think of it this way: Hao Yuan is another Zheng Zhilong."

"To use him to tie us down?"

"Exactly. Only when we are bogged down on the coast of China will we not interfere with his business in the Philippines, if he is indeed there."

"Then it depends on what intelligence Mr. Lando can gather in Manila."

"Mr. Lando is under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. We can't meddle in his affairs for now." Zhao Manxiong said slowly, "Let's focus our breakthrough on the Hangzhou station first."

He straightened his body and resumed his slow pacing. "Did you know? The Executive Committee held a secret enlarged meeting yesterday. I won't list all the participants for you. But I can tell you one of the resolutions from the meeting." He turned to face Wu Mu, a slight smile on his face.

"No, no, you don't need to feel uneasy. What I'm telling you is something you should know within your authority."

"Yes, Comrade Deputy Regional Commander."

"I'll be brief. The Executive Committee has decided at this meeting to send inspection teams to all external stations and bases. I won't list that long string of place names." He looked at his own feet. "Of course, the inspection teams are not targeting any specific location or individual."

Wu Mu understood. "I understand, Comrade Zhao Manxiong."

"Yes, it's good that you understand. I think many of our comrades will understand." Zhao Manxiong said, "The Executive Committee's opinion is that this inspection will be dominated by Cheka personnel, with a focus on auditing project expenditures, especially the over-budget issues of infrastructure and project investment at each station. Of course, other departments will also send personnel to participate."

"Do you want me to join the inspection team?"

"No, you shouldn't go this time. Your identity is too important, and your presence would cause trouble for the comrades. You can arrange for another Elder comrade to go. He should be someone not well-known. Preferably someone few people know. Of course... you know how to choose."

"Yes, Comrade Deputy Regional Commander."

"Alright, you can go back to your work. Give me the materials on this comrade tonight." Zhao Manxiong took a handkerchief from his trouser pocket and wiped the sweat from his forehead. "This damn weather!"

Zhao Manxiong personally opened the office door and saw Wu Mu out. Although he hadn't participated, he knew that yesterday's secret enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee had been very heated. Regarding the positioning of the external stations and the authority of the Elders, all sides had their own positions.

Whether it was Jeju Island or Hangzhou, they had their own spokespersons within the Senate. Issues involving such external stations and Elders always caused great controversy.

In the end, the consensus reluctantly reached by all parties was that the "runaway" trend of the external stations needed to be curbed to some extent. The purpose of sending inspection teams was nothing more than to make a show of force, and at the same time, to realistically assess the actual situation of each external station. It was clearly not enough to just discuss based on reports.

Zhao Manxiong was not interested in the "solo runs" of the dispatched Elders. In his view, it was not important. Under the current system, no Elder could truly "go solo." It was merely a reflection of the struggle for limited resources among the various factions within the Senate at the political level.

On this issue, more than one Elder had tried to win him over, hoping to get a "bombshell" from him that would be detrimental to the dispatched Elders. He had rejected all these attempts. He had no intention of getting himself and the Political Security Bureau involved.
