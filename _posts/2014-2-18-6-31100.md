Lin Ming stayed on the *Dongshanju* for a few more days until the quarantine period was over. He then settled his wages, packed his clothes, and took his leave of the ship. Manager Liu, of course, offered some parting words of wisdom, which Lin Ming naturally accepted with humility.

Following the Port Affairs' instructions, Lin Ming went to the Customs House to apply for a temporary ID card as soon as he disembarked. Having come from a powerful agency himself, he generally understood that this was the 髡贼's equivalent of a "travel permit" or "waist plaque," and without it, he would be unable to move an inch in Lingao. He had learned from the merchants that even businessmen who came to Lingao for short-term trade had to apply for a "temporary permit." Otherwise, once ashore, they couldn't stay in inns. If they encountered the 髡贼's plainclothes police or yamen runners for a spot check, they would have to spend a night in the lockup without a permit and could only be released after finding someone to vouch for them. If they couldn't find anyone to vouch for them, they would have to go to the river works construction site to dig sand for a few months.

Although the pier was bustling with people and the roads were complex, the traffic signs here were very clear, and even easier for someone like Lin Ming who could read. He found his way to the Customs House without much effort.

Although the Customs House bore the name "Customs," it was actually a comprehensive office building for various departments in Bopu Port. Since the Senate implemented a nearly free trade import and export tariff, the actual business of the customs was pitifully small, and naturally, the organization and personnel were also very "lean," occupying only a few offices.

For the purpose of streamlining the organization, the port authority of Lingao encompassed all the functions of the various departments that performed official duties at the port in the old time-space, except for customs and police. And it was the primary task of the Senate's National Police to issue temporary permits to everyone who wanted to stay in Lingao.

Although the National Police did not sound as grand as the Political Security General Bureau, in terms of practical operation, it was the cornerstone of all powerful agencies. Not only were most technical investigation projects controlled by the National Police, but in terms of grasping basic public sentiment, all the powerful agencies also relied on the National Police's organization to carry out their work.

After the comprehensive land survey of Hainan was completed, the National Police began to deploy police agencies and comprehensively clean up the household registration. This work first started in the more densely populated and developed counties of northern Qiong, and then moved to the south. Not only were all the police mobilized, but a large number of Fubo Army soldiers and Fangcaodi students were also mobilized. By the end of 1633, the household registration statistics, registration, and issuance of ID cards for the Han, Miao, and assimilated Li populations in the former Ming-ruled areas of Hainan Island had been completed. The population figures, age structure, and gender ratio of the entire island of Hainan had been roughly grasped.

On this basis, starting from 1631, in response to the increase in the number of foreign merchants, seasonal short-term workers, and immigrants voluntarily going to Lingao, Qiongshan, and other places, the National Police began to establish temporary ID card registration and issuance points at several major population entry points in Hainan, establishing a system of short-term stay with a permit. Under this system, the foreign population could apply for temporary ID cards for a period of fifteen days to one year according to their own needs. Any foreign population found to be active in Hainan without a temporary ID card would be immediately arrested upon inspection.

At the same time, people without permits could not stay in hotels, rent houses, be employed, or apply for business licenses. In short, without a permit, one could not move an inch.

The National Police, the Political Security Bureau, the Civil Affairs People's Committee, and even the Planning Commission—all the government departments of the Senate were eager to grasp the dynamic situation of the floating population.

Many places in Lingao and Hainan were beginning to show the social characteristics of the pre-industrial era. To control the floating population, it was necessary to conduct comprehensive monitoring of the population's dynamics. Entry and exit registration, ID cards and household registration systems, plus accommodation registration and employment registration, could roughly guarantee a certain degree of social control even under rudimentary technical conditions.

Lin Ming did not understand the ins and outs of this, but he was well aware of the power of this system. When he arrived at the registration office, he first registered and filled out a form, followed by a physical examination. The so-called physical examination was just stripping naked and letting a medic take a look—to see if there were any epidemic diseases. With Lingao's level of health care and administrative resources, it was not yet possible to have everyone entering the country undergo "purification." Only "immigrants" organized by the Senate and "immigrants" who came through recruitment, school enrollment, and military enlistment enjoyed such treatment. However, in Lin Ming's view, "purification" was not a good thing. Even this watered-down "physical examination" made him feel deeply humiliated.

"To think that I, a dignified centurion of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, would suffer such a great humiliation! I will not rest until the 髡贼 are destroyed!" Lin Ming thought viciously as he came out of the examination room and fastened his belt.

Holding the physical examination form with the result "Good," Lin Ming returned to the counter. Sitting behind the wooden counter was a female 髡, also wearing a cotton official uniform, but it was black. She had her hair cut short at the ears. Lin Ming already found this hairstyle shocking: not only was it improper, but it was also ugly. He really didn't know how the 髡贼's sense of beauty and ugliness had developed!

"Press your fingerprints, one in each box, don't press them wrong!" the female 髡 instructed. Under the guidance of a naturalized citizen next to him, Lin Ming pressed the fingerprints of his ten fingers one by one on the registration form, and then did the same on a small card.

"Alright, this is your temporary ID card." The female 髡 finally placed the card under a strange machine, pressed down hard on the iron handle, and with a "click," took it out and handed it to Lin Ming. "It's valid for one year. You have to come and renew it when it expires."

Lin Ming took this "Australian travel permit." He saw that it not only had his ten fingerprints, but also his name, age, height, and main facial features, as well as a string of Arabic numerals. There was a round seal on it, but it was not bright red, but a convex seal that had been stamped on with a mold. Lin Ming knew that this alone basically eliminated the possibility of forgery. Looking closer, he saw that the card was not ordinary thick paper. It was not only thick and sturdy, but the paper also had fine and complex patterns that could not be carved and printed by an ordinary woodblock.

He hid this travel permit close to his body. This was the most important thing. If he lost it, he would be unable to move an inch in Lingao. Following the female 髡's instructions, he exchanged some circulation coupons at the Delong counter. Lingao had already completely banned the circulation of gold, silver, and copper coins.

Just as he was about to leave, a middle-aged female 髡 behind a table at the entrance immediately came over with a smile:

"Young man, you just arrived in Lingao, right! Do you have any relatives or friends in Lingao? No? Oh, you're all alone. You don't look rich either. It's inevitable to have a hard time in a new place. I see you are well-dressed and talented, and you can read and write. Why don't you come and join the vocational training class organized by our Civil Affairs People's Committee! After three months of study in the class, there are many different job assignments. You can work if you want to work, or join the army if you want to join the army. If you get good grades in the training, you can even become a cadre directly... Shave your head? Shaving your head is not beheading. Hair can grow back after it's cut. And after shaving, it's clean and tidy, no head lice, and it's convenient to wash your hair... Serving the Senate, you'll have enough to eat, a place to live, and even a wife... Hey, hey, hey, don't go, this great opportunity is right in front of you, don't miss it..."

Lin Ming fled from the female cadre's barrage of words as if he were escaping. But he also knew that the 髡贼 valued educated people very much and were actively recruiting them. Just for this point alone, they were planning to rebel.

After leaving the Customs House, he decided not to linger here. There were too many people and too many eyes, and many guards. With his keen eyes, he easily spotted plainclothes personnel active near the port and pier. As the saying goes, the best place to hide is in the city. Therefore, Lin Ming decided that his first step was to go straight to the East Gate Market. There, he would find any kind of work, find a place to live, and after settling down, he would slowly gather information.

When he exchanged for circulation coupons, he had already found out that the East Gate Market was not far from here—they were connected by a main road. It was only a little over half an hour's walk, and he could also take a public carriage. But the most convenient way was to take the "Lingao City Railway." The female 髡 at the exchange counter, seeing his appearance, suggested he "go for a ride" and "open his eyes." She even gave him directions: "After leaving the pier, follow the main road until you see a three-story red brick building with several arches below. That's the station."

He slung his pack over his shoulder and headed towards Bopu Town. Bopu, which originally had only a few fishing households and could barely be called a place with a permanent population, had now become a bustling port town. The houses and streets were all new and tidy. The wide, black gravel road smelled of seawater and fish. The shops on both sides were bustling with people. Lin Ming noticed that many people in the crowd were "newcomers" like him—dressed in ragged clothes, carrying a small pack, and walking timidly. This made him feel much more at ease.

He walked to a tall red brick building. He saw a stream of people pouring out of several arches like a tide, and many more people pouring in from other arches. He thought this must be it. Looking up at the lintel, he saw three large red characters: "Bopu Station."

Although the new immigrants to Bopu had all heard similar recommendations, most of them had no idea what a "train" was, let alone entering a "station" for the first time in their lives. Many people hesitated at the entrance, afraid to go in, and just looked around from the doorway. Fortunately, the station attendants in blue uniforms were very enthusiastic, constantly greeting and guiding people into the station. For those who couldn't read, they even helped them buy tickets. Lin Ming, thanks to his literacy, had no trouble following the signs: where to enter, where to buy tickets, the destination and price, all were clearly written in large white characters on a blue background. There were also people inside the station to guide and greet them.

So, although there were many people coming and going, it was not chaotic.

Lin Ming saw the price list and bought a ticket to the East Gate Market. The ticket he received was a small, thick card, even thicker than the thickest and sturdiest playing cards. It said "Bopu - East Gate Market," "Second Class Carriage." At the bottom was the date and a line of small characters: "Valid for travel on the day of issue."
