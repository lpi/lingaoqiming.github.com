"What legal issue?"

[Wu Nanhai][y009] thought to himself, "This is bad. My deliberate, profound question has aroused his suspicion and vigilance. This is not good. I should have guided him in a casual discussion."

He immediately resumed his peaceful and magnanimous smile from the Agricultural Committee and Senate meetings: "I mean, although this case does not involve a transmigrator, it at least involves the closest naturalized citizen to a transmigrator. The legal significance cannot be underestimated."

Ji Xin did not speak. A few days ago, he had just attended a meeting of the Law Society, where the main topic of discussion was the trial of the Yang Jihong case: the litigation process, applicable laws, and professional discussions on conviction and sentencing. However, he did not express many opinions at the meeting. In his view, the Yang Jihong case had a deeper level, not just a simple discussion of how to interrogate.

Seeing that he did not show a dismissive expression, [Wu Nanhai][y009] continued:

"You know, I don't know much about legal issues, but Yang Xinwu—I don't know if you're familiar with him—ever since the Yang Jihong incident, he's been moping around my place every day, drowning his sorrows in alcohol. He was once a bright and promising young man, but now he's become so decadent. Out of comradely friendship and a responsible attitude towards my customers, to be honest, I'm a little worried... The matter of Yang Jihong, no matter how you look at it, 'her situation is pitiable.' She is such a lonely and helpless girl, and being a maid here, to put it bluntly, is to serve others with her body, which is already very pitiful. Now she is pregnant with Transmigrator Yang's child and has become a suspect in custody. Although she is only a naturalized citizen, she is still two lives. No matter from which angle you look at it, we should display the spirit of humanism. I personally feel that we can show her leniency." This speech was both sincere and moving. Combined with Old Wu's benevolent and loving face, it was quite persuasive.

However, a strange expression appeared on Ji Xin's face. [Wu Nanhai][y009] felt that something was wrong, but the words had already been spoken and could not be taken back. He had no choice but to continue along his original line of thought:

"You see, the core of this matter is still the identity and rights of the natives. As long as we can provide sufficient legal assistance, I believe..."

Ji Xin nodded and interrupted him: "Are you suggesting that I should be Yang Jihong's defense lawyer?"

For a moment, [Wu Nanhai][y009] felt a little embarrassed, but since his purpose had been seen through, futile concealment was useless. He had no choice but to nod: "That's right." As if to explain his suggestion, "Although she is a native naturalized citizen, it involves two lives and the bloodline of a transmigrator. If she falls into the hands of Fu Youdi... alas, I dare not imagine. I myself feel that I can't bear it."

Ji Xin said, "It won't come to Fu Youdi, but the maid system itself is reactionary and inhumane. I strongly disapprove of it."

"That's right. I also disapprove of this kind of slavery revival. So I hope you can use your legal knowledge to save her." [Wu Nanhai][y009] picked up his teacup. "The same sky, the same face."

This was a lyric from an old-time song, now used by Ji Xin as the slogan of the Native Rights Protection Association. Ji Xin was silent for a long time after hearing this, and then said:

"This matter is my inescapable responsibility. Since I have established this association, even if it is a one-man association, I will see it through to the end and practice what I preach. However, recent events make me feel that the case is a bit complicated..." He pondered for a moment and said, "You are the third person to make this suggestion to me in the past few days."

This time it was [Wu Nanhai][y009]'s turn to show a surprised expression. He couldn't help but ask, "Who else?"

"One is Transmigrator Yang himself," Ji Xin said thoughtfully. "And another female transmigrator whom I am not familiar with."

"A female transmigrator?!"

"Yes," Ji Xin raised his head and scratched his chin. "I can't remember her name. Her surname is Cheng, I think."

"Cheng Yongxin?"

"Yes, that's her name," Ji Xin nodded. "She also came to talk to me about this matter and also talked to me about the protection of the rights and interests of native women. I feel that she is a very thoughtful person. If she hadn't said it herself, I would have thought she was sent by the Queen."

"Oh," [Wu Nanhai][y009] said noncommittally. What was she doing getting involved? [Wu Nanhai][y009] realized that there was a problem here. The last time [Xiao Zishan][y001] had specially called to check who had talked to Yang Xinwu and which transmigrators, he had seen the name Cheng Yongxin on the teahouse's guest consumption record book. And the waitress had also said that she had seen Cheng Yongxin enter Yang Xinwu's private room. Transmigrator Yang had even specially ordered more coffee.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] somewhat regretted getting involved in this matter. But since it had come to this, he could not back down. He said half-jokingly:

"I'm just a person who likes to meddle in other people's business. I can't stand to see my comrades in a gloomy mood. It affects my business. Besides, I'm about to become a father myself. As a new father, I can't bear to see children suffer. Not to mention that Yang Jihong's baby is of the transmigrator's bloodline. Even if it weren't, for the sake of the unborn child, we should try to help her."

"But this case is indeed a bit of a headache. I've read the materials. The facts are clear and the evidence is sufficient. It would be difficult to make a plea of not guilty. I'm afraid we can only argue from a 'humanitarian' perspective."

[Wu Nanhai][y009] had originally thought that he had grasped the "rare commodity" to solve this case, but in the current situation, he decided not to throw it out for the time being, so as not to make Ji Xin suspicious of his excessive enthusiasm.

"This will depend on your efforts. What did everyone come to this time and space for? Isn't it just for the taste of being a superior person? Popova's matter is mainly about Transmigrator Yang's face, and also about the face of many soy sauce transmigrators. I have to ask you all in the legal circle to handle it well."

"I'll do my best."

After seeing Ji Xin off, [Wu Nanhai][y009] quietly returned to the "accounting room," which was the teahouse's "manager's office." The teahouse was gradually expanding, and Chu Qing now rarely went to the front desk to greet guests herself. She was mainly in the "accounting room" "in charge." She had specially taught herself simple business accounting, and now the teahouse's accounts and operations were all personally managed by her.

Although it was unclear what kind of medicine this Cheng Yongxin was selling in her gourd, he had already started to pay attention to this mysterious woman after the General Office's inquiry, and had asked Chu Qing and the waitresses to pay close attention to her movements.

"Husband, what's wrong? Is something the matter?" Chu Qing asked with concern when she saw his gloomy and uncertain expression after he came in.

"It's nothing," [Wu Nanhai][y009] shook his head. "Are you busy right now?"

"Not busy. Those two girls are very smart. I've already taught them the teahouse's accounting method, which has made me much more relaxed..."

Business was very good, so good that the loan from Delong had been fully repaid two-thirds of the time ahead of schedule. After the business became busy, the "accounting room" had been upgraded to the "manager's office." Because Chu Qing had been found to be pregnant three months ago, Chu Qing and [Wu Nanhai][y009] had discussed and decided to buy two maid students with good accounting scores from the maid school to be responsible for the teahouse's financial accounts and administrative work in the "manager's office."

[Wu Nanhai][y009] had originally wanted to promote from the senior waitresses of the teahouse, but Chu Qing felt that the waitresses in the teahouse were now all naturalized citizens who had been freed from their contracts, and she did not trust them. She insisted on buying students with absolute contracts from the maid school.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] felt that this was not good, but Chu Qing thought it was good: "This way I can rest assured, and it's convenient for me to teach and manage them. Otherwise, I can't beat them or scold them, and it's not easy to manage. Besides, if they do well in the future, we can just free them from their contracts. If they don't do well, we can demote them to be waitresses. Only by using both kindness and severity can we manage them well."

[Wu Nanhai][y009] couldn't persuade his wife, so he had to agree.

"Do something for me. Do it quietly." [Wu Nanhai][y009] lowered his voice and instructed Chu Qing to sort out all of Cheng Yongxin's consumption records at the teahouse since the Yang case occurred.

"...The days she came, how long she stayed, what she consumed, which table she sat at, and who sat at the same table or in the same private room with her. You sort it all out, register it separately, and give it to me. You do it yourself."

"Okay, husband." Chu Qing was a little confused, but she never asked much about the affairs between the transmigrators.

The teahouse's account books were very complicated and were all stored in a locked small room in the teahouse's accounting room. Only [Wu Nanhai][y009] and Chu Qing had the keys. In one of the rows of black lacquered file cabinets, the transmigrators' visit and consumption records were stored by date. With the help of the card index, it was easy to find each transmigrator's consumption record, including the content of their orders, the amount of consumption, the seat number or private room number, and also to find the naturalized citizens who came with them.

The account books did not include the content of the conversations. This was absolutely taboo, and [Wu Nanhai][y009] was not so blinded by profit as to do this. But just who sat at the same table with whom, and who entered the same private room, was enough to infer many situations.

The materials sorted out by Chu Qing were seen by him the next day. [Wu Nanhai][y009] looked at her consumption records at the teahouse these days and was shocked. From the records, Cheng Yongxin had come to the teahouse almost every day these days and had frequently met with some people. Those who were clearly connected to the Yang Jihong case included Mu Min, Salina, Su Wan, and Yang Xinwu, as well as Panpan and some other people.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] drew on a piece of white paper with a pencil: Mu Min, Salina, and Su Wan were all members of the National Police and were the direct handlers of the case. Panpan was from the propaganda department. The common point of these four people was that they were all women.

Three women make a play. Now, with the addition of Cheng Yongxin and Mu Min, five women, all transmigrators, gathered together. What did they want to do? [Wu Nanhai][y009] hesitated for a long time, took out a PHS from his locked drawer, and dialed a number:

"[Director Xiao][y001]? This is Nanhai. I have something to report to you."
