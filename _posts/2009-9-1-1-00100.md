The protagonist of this story, or rather, one of the protagonists, is named [Xiao Zishan][y001].

[Xiao Zishan][y001] was born in the late 1970s and was an ordinary person: ordinary family, ordinary looks, very ordinary talents, and not someone willing to strive for advancement. So, his academic performance was average. Thanks to the expansion of university admissions, he also became a university student.

After graduating, [Xiao Zishan][y001] worked for several companies in the Pearl River Delta, was deceived by unscrupulous bosses, and had unrealistic dreams. Finally, he found a decent-paying job in a foreign company, working diligently for his salary. He had been doing this for nearly six or seven years. In the blink of an eye, he was thirty, still living in someone else's house. He had few hobbies, just a love for history and reading obscure books. He had a girlfriend once, losing the virginity he had preserved for so long. But by the time our story begins, he could barely remember his ex-girlfriend's face—he still belonged to the group that celebrated Singles' Day on November 11th.

On the night our story begins, the weather was very bad. The dark sky was constantly flashing with lightning—this had been going on for almost half a month. Sometimes there would be a downpour after the lightning, other times just rolling thunder. Rumors of a major earthquake had been circulating for a long time, but over time, people had grown accustomed to it. [Xiao Zishan][y001] got off the bus with a yawn, his eyelids swollen, his legs sore, and his hair disheveled, the very picture of a disheveled member of the working poor. He hadn't been home for a day and a night. As a newly promoted regional manager, he had to stay in the office for a long time preparing reports for an inspection by his superiors, especially the whereabouts of one expense reimbursement after another, which really gave him a headache.

To say that Xiao was a parasite in the company would be a great injustice. [Xiao Zishan][y001] had officially held this position for less than three months. In the six or seven years since he joined the company, he had been stuck in the basic position of a regional sales representative. The various levels of leadership above him had been cut down and replaced like leeks, one after another, while he remained like the root of the leek.

Three months ago, the leaders had changed shifts again, leaving behind a pile of inexplicable reports and invoices as usual. Only this time, he was appointed as the regional manager.

If he had gotten this position two years earlier... he would have been eternally grateful to the company. But at this moment—[Xiao Zishan][y001] just wanted to say one thing to all the leaders, past and present: Grass Mud Horse.

The company, under the global economic crisis, had been half-paralyzed since last year. Familiar colleagues in the regional office had also disappeared one after another. The remaining business was so little that he felt idle doing it all by himself. This appointment at this time, with no mention of adjusting his long-stagnant salary after the promotion, and no instructions on how to develop the business, made it easy for him to understand with his seven or eight years of professional experience—this was a prelude to the closure of the regional office. He was just a caretaker, and once all matters were settled, he would have to pack up and leave.

But the paperwork still had to be done... so that he could receive that long-stagnant salary for a few more months.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] sighed for the twentieth time. He was carrying a large travel bag. From the bag itself to its contents, everything was promotional giveaways left over from the office over the years: from kitchen aprons, T-shirts, and toothbrushes to ballpoint pens, there was everything. They were all cheap little commodities. Except for a few things, he basically had no use for them. Yet he still greedily took them back—a man of short will because of poverty—this saying was truly fitting for him.

The rented room was still clean and tidy. After a shower, he felt invigorated. He casually turned on his computer and went online.

Orson Welles said that the lottery is the painkiller of the poor. Then the internet is the opium for people like [Xiao Zishan][y001], whether it be online games, BBS forums, or the web novels he read every day.

Before he started working, [Xiao Zishan][y001] was something of a semi-literary youth. He had read a lot of miscellaneous books without much deep understanding and also liked to write. However, his talent was limited, and he didn't make a living from writing. After working for a few years, literary novels, no matter how profound or meaningful, were completely banished by him—he had seen too much of the reality of society and no longer needed novels to give him any more feelings. What he loved to read most were all kinds of YY novels about transmigrating to the past and remaking history... This was probably related to his being a history lover and always having a desire to tamper with history. In short, he had to read some every day. As he had once said in self-mockery, it was "spiritual masturbation."

Besides his daily spiritual masturbation, he also regularly visited a few BBS forums. Like a drug addict, he would feel empty if he didn't go. In fact, he wasn't a prominent figure on the forums, but the various miscellaneous information, theories, and knowledge provided on the BBS, the various debates and quarrels, the colorful display of human nature, even the performances of some hypocrites who were Marxist in their upper body and Casanova in their lower body, were much more interesting than a society full of masks.

On the BBS, as usual, he first looked at the hot posts of the day.

"I've discovered a wormhole to the Ming Dynasty! It's absolutely true!"

Seeing this title, [Xiao Zishan][y001] couldn't help but smile wryly. Have people gone mad from reading transmigration novels these days? Or are they all dissatisfied with their current reality, eager to start over in another world?

Then he saw that the post was from [Chief Wen][y002]. Speaking of which, [Chief Wen][y002] was one of the "survivalist maniacs" on this BBS that [Xiao Zishan][y001] admired. Not to mention his broad knowledge, his meticulous consideration of transmigration and survival issues was also rare. It was a pity that [Chief Wen][y002] didn't write transmigration novels, otherwise [Xiao Zishan][y001] would definitely follow his novels—of course, only reading the pirated versions.

"It must be some new whimsical idea of [Chief Wen][y002]'s." [Xiao Zishan][y001] casually clicked on the post. With that click, his world also changed.

To put it in cliché terms, "the wheels of fate began to turn."

**One week later.**

"This is the wormhole?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] cautiously looked at the luminous object in front of him. Strictly speaking, it was a slightly irregular circle, with a faint blue light. It wasn't much different from the wormholes he had imagined, the only difference being that the light was not strong, and its size was much smaller, only as big as a bathroom mirror.

"It's very small," said [Wang Luobin][y003]. Like [Xiao Zishan][y001], he was also one of the first people who decided to come and see after communicating with [Chief Wen][y002].

"The edge can be expanded with a certain amount of pressure." [Wen Desi][y002] sat on the lid of the toilet. The bathroom was a bit crowded with three people crammed inside. "This opening can be enlarged or shrunk, as long as a certain amount of force is applied symmetrically on the diameter. The expansion and contraction of the opening are synchronized in both spacetimes," [Wen Desi][y002] explained. "When the opening is shrunk to 210mm, the wormhole will close and can no longer connect the spacetimes."

"Can it really be traversed back and forth?" In [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s impression, transmigration was one-way. You were either hit by a car or struck by lightning. The gentlest was getting lost. The common feature was that there was no going back.

"If I couldn't come back, I wouldn't have been able to post, and you wouldn't be here," he said. "I estimate that the location after crossing over should be consistent with the place where the transmigration occurred."

"You should have bought a lottery ticket, [Chief Wen][y002]," [Xiao Zishan][y001] muttered to himself. "The probability of finding a wormhole in the bathroom is even lower than winning the jackpot."

"Is this not the jackpot?" [Wen Desi][y002] smiled with satisfaction. "Is there a lottery ticket that can win you a world?"

"[Chief Wen][y002], didn't you always say: a solo, two-way, low-profile transmigration is the kingly way?" [Wang Luobin][y003] recalled the discussion about transmigration on the BBS back then.

"That's right." [Wen Desi][y002] pointed at the wormhole. "Do you know what's behind that? A world!" He waved his arms excitedly. "Through it, I can have a planet, a universe!"

"You alone conquering the world?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] expressed serious doubt.

"That's why I made that post..." [Wen Desi][y002] seemed a little reluctant. "Besides, the other side is not a pleasant spacetime."

"What spacetime?"

"Probably the Tianqi era. I found a Tianqi Tongbao coin."

Both [Xiao Zishan][y001] and [Wang Luobin][y003] gasped—the new world [Chief Wen][y002] had found was an era run rampant by eunuchs.
