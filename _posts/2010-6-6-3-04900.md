It turned out that these were the spoils from a recent pirate stronghold raid in Haikang County. Many people had been captured. The men, regardless of age, were executed as pirates on the spot. The "pirate dependents" who hadn't managed to escape were divided up among the government troops and local militia, with the rest being handed over to the county for official sale.

Because they were "pirate dependents," most people were unwilling to get involved. Even though the price was low, there were few buyers. After seven or eight days, only half had been sold.

Chang Shide, seeing that the women appeared to be in good physical condition, bought the entire group of various ages for a package deal of ten taels of silver. Liao Dahua thought to himself that this master's tastes were truly unconventional.

After buying the women, Chang Shide lost interest in continuing his stroll and announced he was heading back. The unfortunate "pirate dependents" slowly followed the sedan chair back.

Wen Tong was surprised to see Chang Shide return with five or six raggedly dressed women. He had heard Chang Shide mention buying maids several times, but he hadn't thought it was urgent and figured they could deal with it after the sugar harvest season. He hadn't expected him to actually buy them, and five at once no less—ranging from mature women to young girls.

Seeing this impressive procession enter the plantation, the women very consciously lined up against the wall, waiting for Chang Shide to swagger out of his sedan chair. They all knelt down together. Wen Tong thought to himself, *so you're into S&M, you little rascal*.

"Not bad, eh?" Chang Shide's face was beaming. "Only cost ten taels of silver!"

Wen Tong sighed. "Where is this expense coming from? You only have coupons. Isn't this using public funds for private gain?"

"Of course not. We were allowed to purchase people anyway," Chang Shide said nonchalantly. "Consider it for taking care of our daily lives, cooking for everyone, and so on."

"Alright, but the 'purification' process for these people is on you. I still have to deal with the sugar factory."

With the company leadership's permission, Chang Shide immediately became extremely busy. Fortunately, Liao Dahua was also very accommodating. Both were ordinary middle-class men with a bit of a licentious streak. Although Liao Dahua had some objections to Chang Shide's aesthetic taste—firstly, all five women had unbound feet, and secondly, in his eyes, they were all a bit too sturdy; Liao Dahua preferred the frail, flat-chested type of woman.

"Get up, all of you, get up," Chang Shide said. No one understood his Mandarin, so Liao Dahua quickly translated. The women hesitated for a moment before standing up. He had wanted to take them into his room for a close-up physical inspection, but the stench wafting from ten feet away reminded him that they were in more urgent need of a bath. And the matted, rope-like hair clearly concealed a host of parasites.

Chang Shide had to temporarily suppress his desire to inspect the goods and called for Wen Xiu.

"Take them to the bathing area and give them a good wash!" Chang Shide thought for a moment. "You've been through the 'purification' training, right?"

"Yes, I know it," Wen Xiu replied. He had been through the same ordeal himself and had received some training before being selected as their servant.

"Do it exactly according to that procedure. But we don't have a doctor here—"

Liao Dahua quickly interjected, "No problem, there are physicians in the county. I'll ask two of them to come over."

Chang Shide wondered about the competence of these herbal doctors. Hearing that the women were pirate dependents, he worried about potential venereal diseases like gonorrhea or syphilis. So he added, "Get one who specializes in venereal diseases."

"There's an old physician in the county who is an expert in this field. He once treated the garrison commander for a venereal disease and is highly skilled. They call him 'Old Army Doctor.' I'll get him."

"Good, bring the Old Army Doctor."

With that, Chang Shide went back to his room to bathe and rest. He woke up to find the sun already setting in the west. Feeling content, he emerged from his room and was startled by a row of shaved heads under the eaves. Looking closer, he saw it was the five women, standing against the wall. Their uniform cotton clothes and shiny heads clearly indicated that their "purification" process was complete.

Seeing their master come out, the women all knelt down. The feeling was quite pleasant for Chang Shide, who had long been oppressed by his wife and occasionally "volunteered" as a human punching bag. He once again confirmed that not bringing his wife along was absolutely the right decision.

Hearing the commotion in the courtyard, Wen Xiu hurried over.

"Master is awake," he said respectfully. "The purification is all done."

"Good." Chang Shide examined the bowed, shaved heads and regretted not having specified that they shouldn't be shaved bald—a short haircut and a good wash would have been sufficient. How could their bald heads possibly arouse his interest? But he couldn't bring himself to say it. With a straight face, he asked, "Has the doctor examined them?"

Seeing that although he said "good," his face showed displeasure, Wen Xiu became even more cautious.

"Yes, the physicians have examined them. The women are all clean. The prescription for the deworming medicine you ordered has been prepared, and they have already taken it this afternoon. The Old Army Doctor was particularly eager to please and also prescribed some formulas for women's health and vitality. Should I have the medicine prepared for them?" He pulled out a few sheets of paper from his sleeve.

"Of course, why not? The Executive Committee—" Chang Shide was about to say that the Executive Committee's money was there to be spent, but he stopped himself, realizing it wouldn't sound good if it got out.

"Yes, and the Old Army Doctor also sent a package of secret medicine for you, Master. He asks you to accept it, saying it's very effective. If you find it good—"

Chang Shide knew that this so-called "secret medicine" was nothing more than some kind of aphrodisiac. Whether it worked or not was another matter, but consuming such dubious substances was definitely more harmful than beneficial.

"I don't want it. Throw it away," he said with disgust. "By the way, did they get the 'Three Whites Soup'?"

"'Three Whites Soup'?" Wen Xiu was taken aback. "No, but the physicians haven't left yet. I'll go and have them prescribe it right away."

"Go on, quickly."

Wen Xiu tactfully withdrew.

*I wonder if the Three Whites Soup will have any effect on their skin color,* Chang Shide muttered to himself, looking at their dark skin. Although dark skin didn't affect their practical use, he was habitually partial to fairer women.

Chang Shide decided to properly inspect the women. In the morning at the human market, he had only given them a cursory glance due to lack of time, and they were all so disheveled and dirty that he couldn't make out the details.

"Get up, get up, all of you stand up." The women didn't understand his words, but they understood his gestures. The female slaves obediently stood up.

These women were quite in line with "modern" aesthetic tastes. First, they all had unbound feet. Second, their height, except for the one young girl, the shortest was about 152 or 153 centimeters, and the tallest was over 160 centimeters. And most of them were well-muscled. Tall and sturdy women were a rare sight in this region.

He hadn't had high expectations for their looks, just hoping they wouldn't be too "East Asian-featured"—although centuries apart, he wasn't a foreigner with peculiar tastes and had no interest in the so-called typical East Asian Mongolian features of small eyes, a flat nose, high cheekbones, and thick lips. Looking at them now, although the four adult women weren't exactly beauties, they weren't "mangoes" either. Two had the distinct facial features of people from Guangdong and Fujian, while another had the long face of a northern Han Chinese with a prominent nose.

Probably due to long hours of outdoor labor, the women were still quite dark even after bathing. Chang Shide knew this was unavoidable: pirate dependents weren't sheltered young ladies. They likely had to do a lot of manual labor in the stronghold, and the ultraviolet rays of southern China were no joke.

Chang Shide chose the tallest woman, whose skin seemed slightly fairer. He reached into her collar. The slave flinched but didn't dare to move, standing stiffly as he conducted his hands-on survey. Her skin was surprisingly smooth and delicate to the touch, much better than the rough skin on her face, which had been exposed to the sun and sea breeze. Her figure was better than he had imagined, especially her breasts. Having had low expectations for their size, he was pleasantly surprised to find that she was at least a C-cup. Savoring the moment, he found her muscles firm, her waist slender, her breasts a bit saggy but firm, and her hips large. In both his time and this one, she would be considered a woman "good for childbearing." Chang Shide decided to strike while the iron was hot and claim her for himself. Thinking of Wen Xiu, who had tried to seduce him, a wicked idea popped into his head. "You shall be called A'Xiu."

He then measured the other female slaves, except for the little girl—Chang Shide had no interest in such young lolis. He randomly named them A'Zhu, A'Zi, and A'Bi, based on "The Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils," which he had been reading before bed recently. The little girl was simply named A'Luo.

After he was done, he called Wen Xiu in.

"From now on, you will teach them to speak Mandarin." Although their primary duty was to serve him physically, some communication was necessary, such as discussing positions and other special needs.

"Yes, I will teach them well," Wen Xiu readily agreed, knowing that taking care of the master's women was a quick way to curry favor.

"Do they have any family relations among them?"

"Reporting to Master, none at all. They are not even from the same place."

"What about A'Luo?"

"She used to live with her brother. He went missing when the government troops broke into the stronghold. Now she's all alone."

Wen Xiu asked again, "Master, where should these women be housed?"

"Put them in the east wing of the courtyard, with the two rough-handed maids."

As they were speaking, A'Luo, who had been standing silently in the line and mostly ignored, suddenly fainted—just like that, without any warning, she collapsed to the ground.

Chang Shide was startled. "What happened?"

The female slaves didn't dare to speak. Wen Xiu said, "She fainted from hunger. They haven't eaten since they came back this noon—"

"You idiot, why didn't you give them lunch?"

Wen Xiu felt wronged. "You ordered, Master, that they had to be presented to you before anything else. After the purification, I brought them here, but you were taking your afternoon nap—I didn't dare to disturb you, so I had them wait..."

"Never mind, get them some food quickly. It's not good if they starve." As a 21st-century man, Chang Shide, while happy to experience the life of a slave owner, still had some basic concept of human rights.

Wen Xiu hurried off and soon returned with two maids carrying a pot of hot congee and plenty of pickles, bowls, and chopsticks.

"Everyone, eat up. Eat slowly, don't overeat."

The female slaves, who had been trembling when their master got angry, were now faced with his smiling face and were at a loss. But the pot of congee was an immense temptation for people who were starving. They couldn't be bothered with fear anymore and gathered around. There was no dining hall at the plantation, so the women sat on the stone steps and ate. The courtyard was filled with the sound of slurping. They ate with such gusto that it was clear the Ming government had been quite harsh on these female captives. Chang Shide thought he needed to supplement their nutrition to make their skin and hair shiny.

He chose A'Zhu, who had better looks and figure, to be Wen Tong's maid. As for A'Xiu, A'Bi, and A'Zi, he shamelessly claimed them all for himself. The thought of having his own team made him, one of the many who had been eagerly awaiting a "life secretary" in Lingao, feel that his decision to come out with Wen Tong to run a sugar factory was incredibly wise and a source of great pride. *Who needs a life secretary? I'm not interested in that anymore.*

Now that he had a team, Chang Shide considered gradually cultivating them based on their different personalities and characteristics. Some should be good at cooking, others should be literate, and of course, they all had to learn various life service skills, such as massage. As for the more professional skills to enhance male-female harmony, it was a pity there was no electricity here, otherwise, there would be plenty of instructional videos to watch. He would have to teach them himself, through practice. The women trained this way, hehe...

Wen Xiu and the women watched their master standing alone, his face blank, his eyes shining, occasionally letting out a silly laugh, and drool trickling from the corner of his mouth. They couldn't help but feel scared. Wen Xiu, afraid he was having a fit, quickly called out, "Master—"

"Ah, oh, it's nothing." Chang Shide came back to his senses. "Also, teach them your set of serving skills!"

"Yes, I understand."

That night, Chang Shide lay in bed, reliving the scene of inspecting the female slaves' bodies during the day. The more he replayed it, the more he became aroused, tossing and turning. The faces of the women appeared in his mind one by one. Their shaved heads suddenly seemed insignificant and could no longer prevent a certain organ from becoming engorged.

"Wen Xiu!" he called out.

Wen Xiu ran in.

"Go and bring A'Xiu here!"
