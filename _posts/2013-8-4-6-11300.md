Although he was happy to have gained some clarity, Instructor Wang soon fell into a state of anxiety again.

"This is precisely what I am worried about!" Wang Ci suddenly said in a hushed, urgent tone. "Headmaster, please consider this. The Australians have already defeated the court's regular army. Given the state of the court today, I fear there will be no further action for another eight or ten years. The... Australians, even if they don't declare their own dynasty, will surely become a powerful vassal state of the Great Ming. I am not ignorant of current affairs. The empire is in turmoil, and the people are destitute. If someone could bring peace and stability to the nation, and secure the people and the court, that would be for the best. Even rewarding them with a prefecture or several counties would not be excessive. But the Australians are in their ascendancy, and they possess so many secret arts. I fear they have ambitions to seize the throne!"

These words were extremely blunt. If not for the endless chaos of the late Ming Dynasty, which had desensitized the scholars, such a statement would have been considered treasonous.

Liu Dalin stroked his beard and remained silent for a long time. Finally, he let out a soft sigh. "We have received great favor from the state and are not disloyal or unfilial men. But the Mandate of Heaven is fickle and cannot be resisted by human effort. My former students have been writing to me frequently of late, mostly to inquire about the Australians' internal affairs. They say the situation at court and in the country is rotten beyond words. Even if His Majesty wishes to govern with vigor, I'm afraid it's a futile effort! I fear that in less than ten years, something unbearable will happen..."

Instructor Wang was so startled he nearly dropped his chopsticks. "You mean to say—"

"I only hope this is my own groundless fear," he said, his expression grave. He continued, "Since ancient times, the change of dynasties has been a common occurrence. The Australians have come with their secret arts and are governing with such diligence here. I'm afraid they have long harbored ambitions to contend for the throne."

This view was not particularly unique among the gentry and common people of Lingao, but coming from Liu Dalin's mouth for the first time, it carried a different weight. A chill ran down Wang Ci's spine.

"Alas—"

"I'm afraid there are very few people in this county who don't think this way," Jinshi Liu said with a faint smile, though it was tinged with bitterness. Although he had been influenced and gradually changed his opinion of the Australians over the years, and they were even his saviors, he still felt he had received the grace of the Great Ming, the true "vast imperial favor." Even though he saw the future clearly, he couldn't help but feel a sense of regret and reluctance for the dynasty that had given him grace and glory.

Wang Ci quickly added, "Headmaster, it has always been difficult to defy the will of Heaven, and I have no intention of going against it. However, since ancient times, no matter how dynasties have changed, one thing has remained constant: 'the court governs the world only with the scholar-officials.' Now, although these Australians can be said to practice 'education for all,' the books they teach and the schools they run have nothing to do with the sages' classics. Yet, they govern Lingao so well. I often think that these students, upon graduation, will surely become the Australians' right-hand men, and they will surely build factories and railways here. But if that happens, what will become of the gentry and the scholars? What will the future look like? I dare not think, cannot think, and cannot understand it!"

He had been pondering these words for a long time. Deep in the heart of this disillusioned minor official, the life and death of the Great Ming was not the most important thing. What mattered was that the髡-haired bandits were introducing a completely new system of knowledge. Under this system, all the old knowledge and learning that he and the other scholars possessed would become worthless. The very thing that allowed them to command at least the basic respect of the common people even in their most destitute moments would turn to dust. This was what he feared and dreaded the most.

What use was his position as an instructor to the bandits? Instructor Wang knew full well that he could still collect over a hundred circulation coupons from the long-since-complacent county yamen to get by, all because the Australians were currently unwilling to shed the skin of the Great Ming. If one day they truly decided to "change skins," he, the County School Instructor of Lingao of the Great Ming, would either have to pack his bags and go back to his hometown, or he would have to go to the refugee camps to teach the "Hundred Family Surnames" and "Three Character Classic" to make a living. From this perspective, he was far more anxious than the detached Jinshi Liu.

Indeed, these words seemed to have moved Jinshi Liu. Seeing him nod slightly, Wang Ci quickly pressed on:

"I came here for two reasons. One was to probe the Australians' secrets and true strength, but I am incompetent. Even sitting in their classrooms and looking at their books, I cannot understand a thing. On the other hand, if the Australians can truly follow the tide of events, I am willing to persuade them to embrace civilization and not rely solely on brute force. I hope you will help me, sir."

The more Wang Ci spoke, the more agitated he became, his tone growing more urgent. If not for the circumstances, he might have kowtowed to Liu Dalin. As it was, he still bowed with his hands clasped.

How could Jinshi Liu not understand the meaning behind these words? But he knew in his heart that this would not be easy to achieve. The髡-haired bandits were not like the barbarians of the Five Hu and Sixteen Kingdoms or the Mongol Yuan, who didn't even have their own written language. They were a people with their own thoughts and values. Their daily conduct seemed to be a mix of Legalism and Mohism, with elements of various other schools of thought—a hodgepodge by any measure. To make them "embrace civilization" would be as difficult as ascending to heaven. With their strength, they were more likely to "transform China with barbarian ways" in the future.

Liu Dalin thought for a moment, and was about to say something, but was interrupted by several bursts of noise from the students in the distance. A few female students were laughing and cheering as they watched two big male students arm-wrestle, shouting "Go! Go!" The sunlight shone on their youthful, vibrant faces, leaving Liu Dalin and Wang Ci at a loss for words for a moment. They only felt so old and powerless.

Huang Bingkun paid no attention to the commotion in the dining hall. He was sitting across from a Yuanlao teacher, eating. It had been several years since the Australians landed and did so many earth-shattering things, but this was the first time Huang Bingkun had come face to face with a髡-haired bandit. It was Teacher Dong from the first day's lecture. He looked to be a man of about thirty, with dark skin and muscular arms, appearing strong and powerful, but his knowledge was beyond Huang Bingkun's comprehension. The Australian across from him seemed to be watching him with amusement as he ate, which made Huang Bingkun feel very unnatural. He wanted to say something, but felt he couldn't get any words out.

Today, he had woken up early specifically to observe the morning run of the entire school's six thousand students. Two hundred 30-person "internal affairs classes" appeared on campus at the same time! They ran in neat formations along specific routes, crisscrossing without interfering with each other, which he found breathtaking. At the same time, a question arose: if the bandits were using teaching as a pretext to secretly train a strong army, most of these students were very young. They didn't look like they could be sent into battle in two or three years. To spend so much energy drilling such young children seemed less effective than directly recruiting and training young adults. Among the thousands of northern refugees recently transported here, there were plenty of able-bodied young men to be conscripted. And judging by the huge investment they were making in these students, these "imitation-髡" students were destined to be the core of the Australians' forces in the future. They would never be used as cannon fodder.

What was their ultimate goal in investing so much capital to educate so many children with Australian learning? Huang Bingkun felt he was beginning to see a faint outline of their plan.

Although Second Young Master Huang didn't see things as clearly as Instructor Wang and Jinshi Liu, he understood that the students of Fangcao would inevitably become the trusted confidants of the髡-haired bandits in the future. Besides being soldiers and workers, they would undoubtedly also become officials and "cadres" to govern the people. People like himself, he feared, would not only have a hard time getting ahead in Lingao in the future, but the "old matter" of his father leading troops to besiege the bandits would be enough to cause the Huang family endless trouble.

For now, their footing was not yet stable, so they allowed him to be a member of the county advisory board as a gesture of appeasement. Once their wings were fully grown, he feared, it would be the day of reckoning for the Huang family. Huang Bingkun thought grimly.

"Mr. Huang, you don't have much of an appetite."

Somehow, the man across from him had struck up a conversation. Huang Bingkun quickly pulled himself together to respond.

"No, it's just that I feel a bit unwell, so my appetite is poor." Over the past few years, Huang Bingkun had learned a smattering of "Australian Mandarin." Although it wasn't standard, it was just about enough to communicate with the Yuanlao.

"You should participate in more physical exercise. That way, your body will be healthier, and your appetite will improve," Yuanlao Dong said.

In fact, Huang Bingkun came from a family of scholar-farmers. He not only worked in the fields with his hired hands but also practiced martial arts in his spare time. He was by no means a stranger to physical exertion. But he was in no mood to explain this now and just said "yes" a few times.

"There's a ball game this afternoon, you should come and watch. I hear your Huang family has many members. You could start a team and play for fun. When we organize a league, you can field a team to compete."

Yuanlao Dong's enthusiasm was, in fact, driven by his own "selfish" motives. Like most male Yuanlao, he was a huge fan of sports like football and basketball. Although conditions after D-Day had made it impossible to organize football, basketball, and volleyball, the less equipment-intensive sports of English rugby and baseball had taken off. As a committee member of the "Rugby Grand Alliance," Yuanlao Dong was very keen on expanding the league by recruiting more teams. The industry-based teams within the naturalized citizen system were mostly organized, and they were now expanding to the villages and towns. Huang Family Village was a large settlement, and its militia had a reputation for being "able to fight," so he wanted to pull them into the league system.

"A ball game?" Huang Bingkun vaguely recalled Huang Ping mentioning something about a ball game. He had heard it was a very intense type of ball sport. The Great Ming didn't have any competitive sports; they were generally classified as "pastimes." Now, hearing this Yuanlao personally invite him to watch, it seemed to be a very important matter to the髡-haired bandits, so he readily agreed. "Of course, I must go and see it."

"It's at the stadium, starting at one in the afternoon," Yuanlao Dong quickly pitched. This was the second young master of the Huang family, a man of considerable importance in his household. If he could be persuaded, it would be much easier to get the Huang family to field a team.
