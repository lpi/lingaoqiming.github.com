"It may be crude, but the scale is incredible." Every foundry he visited was a cacophony of noise and blazing fire, bustling with activity, whether casting bronze or iron. The scale of production was already impressive. In the open yard of just one workshop, there were dozens of cannons of all sizes and lengths, a sight that left Huang Tianyu breathless.

The cannons were still being cast using the traditional clay mold method, but the craftsmanship was excellent. However, in Huang Tianyu's expert opinion, they were all old-fashioned models, either "tiger-crouching" cannons or breech-loading culverins. The largest were only "great general" cannons; there was no sign of the legendary Western "red barbarian" cannons.

"There are many foundry workers here, and their wages are surprisingly low," Huang Tianyu said in a low voice back in their room. "I asked around. Only the master craftsmen earn one or two taels a month. The ordinary workers live hand-to-mouth. Many can't even afford to marry. They live very hard lives. It wouldn't be difficult to recruit workers with the wages we're offering."

"What about the ceramic workers you were looking for?"

Liu San was not a member of the Industrial and Energy Committee, but he was in charge of this trip, so all matters had to be discussed with him before any action could be taken.

"They're even worse off," Huang Tianyu said grimly. "To be honest, I saw a mass grave for the first time today. It was right near a large kiln. The bottom of the pit was filled with bones. When workers die without anyone to claim their bodies, they're just thrown in. In the half-hour I was there, several bodies were tossed in. The living don't look much better; they're like little ghosts from hell, covered in black soot. I heard many workers are unemployed. Recruiting them will be even easier than recruiting foundry workers."

"Then start recruiting," Liu San said. "But we're strangers here and have no official reason to be doing this. It won't be easy. If we attract the attention of the authorities and they ask us why we're hiring workers, what will we say?"

"Putting up a recruitment sign probably won't work, but we can network privately," Huang Tianyu suggested. "We can start by talking to one or two workers, and then have them spread the word to others who are willing to go to Lin'gao. The first batch shouldn't be too large, just a dozen or so. Once they see the benefits, we can send them back to recruit more people privately."

"Alright, let's do that." Liu San took a fifty-tael bank draft from his coat. "I'll go to the Yang Run Kai Tang tomorrow and cash this. Then you can pay the settling-in allowance. Two taels of silver for each worker who agrees to go. Don't forget to have them put their thumbprint on the contract!" He opened a jewelry box he used for important documents and took out a stack of pre-printed contracts.

"Qiwei has a branch of their escort agency in Foshan," Liu San said. "Once you've gathered the men, take them there in batches to make contact. Someone will arrange for their departure. This is the token." He gave Huang Tianyu an ivory pick.

As they were plotting, a commotion was heard outside. Chen Tong ran in and announced, "Master Liu, a beggar is insisting on seeing you."

"A beggar?" Liu San frowned, then remembered the young man he had treated that day. "Give him a few hundred coins and send him on his way."

"I tried, but he refused," Chen Tong said. "He says you saved his life and wants to see you in person to kowtow to you."

"Alright, let him in," Liu San sighed. Doing good deeds sometimes led to unwelcome complications.

A moment later, a young, sturdy man strode in. It was indeed the man he had saved. In just a few hours, he had made a full recovery. He walked with a powerful stride, carrying himself with the air of a martial artist.

Upon seeing Liu San, he immediately dropped to his knees and kowtowed. "Huang Ande thanks Doctor Liu for saving my life!"

"No need for formalities. Please, get up." Liu San had to help him up, thinking he would definitely need a bath before bed—the man exuded a mixture of unidentifiable, pungent odors.

Huang Ande stood up. He had Mongolian eyes, high cheekbones, and a straight nose, looking very different from the locals. His eyes were small but bright and full of spirit. His demeanor was not that of a professional beggar accustomed to groveling, nor was he timid like a typical countryman. Liu San felt an instant liking for him and told Chen Tong to give him five hundred coins and a bottle of "Plague-Averting Powder."

"No, no, I can't accept," Huang Ande shook his head repeatedly. "I came only to thank you, my benefactor. The pharmacy clerk said that if you hadn't saved me on the spot, my life would have been lost."

"Saving the dying and healing the wounded is the duty of us doctors. There's no need to speak of gratitude," Liu San said with a sincere expression, not mentioning that he had only done it for the free advertising. "You are penniless, and it's the height of summer. You should take this for emergencies."

Huang Ande didn't reply. He simply bowed deeply again and turned to leave.

Liu San noticed the man's muscular arms and the scars on his hands. A thought struck him, and he called out, "Brother Huang, may I ask what you did for a living before you fell on such hard times?"

"I used to work at a foundry here," Huang Ande said in a rough voice. "But I have no real skills, just brute strength to earn my meals. The foreman said I ate too much and had a bad temper, so he fired me a few days ago."

A foundry worker. This was a ready-made recruit. Liu San and Huang Tianyu exchanged a look. They had the same idea: take him in. The young man was strong, had some casting experience, and with proper training, could become a valuable worker. At the very least, with his physique, he would make a fine soldier—a 1.7-meter-tall soldier was a rarity in these times.

Huang Tianyu said, "Brother Huang, I have a business in Qiongzhou Prefecture that is in need of hands. Since you have nowhere to go, why not come with me to Qiongzhou?"

"To Qiongzhou?" Huang Ande rolled his eyes, thinking. "No! I hear that place is full of miasma and disease. I probably wouldn't survive."

The refusal was blunt. Liu San smiled. "This business is a joint venture between me and Master Huang. With me around, what are you afraid of? I guarantee your safety."

Huang Ande hesitated, then asked, "Will there be meat to eat?" He quickly added, "Once every ten or fifteen days is fine! I'm not a greedy person."

"Yes," Liu San replied without hesitation. The current food standard for the New Army and heavy laborers in the Industrial Department was fish every day and meat every week. The quantity wasn't large, but the supply was guaranteed.

"Alright then, I'll go with you!" Huang Ande nodded, then knelt and kowtowed again. "Master!"

"That's enough, no more kowtowing." Liu San found the man's rough charm endearing. It was a pity he wasn't suited for medicine, or he would have kept him by his side. "You'll have to sign a contract."

"I have to sell myself?" Huang Ande looked reluctant. "If I have to sell myself, I'm not going. I don't like being a slave."

"It's not a contract of servitude, it's an employment contract. Don't you have to sign a contract to be a long-term laborer?"

"Deal!" he nodded.

He pressed his thumbprint on the contract. Liu San asked if he had any family here that he wanted to bring along, or if he wanted the two taels of silver as a settling-in allowance.

"I'm all alone here, no family. I don't need the silver. As long as I have meat to eat with the master," Huang Ande grinned.

"Where are you from?"

"From?" Huang Ande scratched his head. "I'm from Shandong. My family is from Dengzhou," he said. "I couldn't stay in Dengzhou anymore. I heard a brother of mine was transferred to Guangdong, so I came to seek refuge with him, but..." He suddenly fell silent.

It seemed Huang Ande had a secret. "Transferred"? Combined with his demeanor, Liu San guessed he was probably a deserter from the army. A deserter was fine; as long as he could work.

Liu San told Chen Tong to take him for a bath, get him a haircut, and buy him two sets of clothes from a second-hand shop. He also told Gao Di to air out his formal clothes in preparation for the banquet at Lin Ming's house the next day.

It was Lin Ming's wife's twenty-eighth birthday, and the entire household was in a festive mood. Almost all the local wealthy merchants and gentry had come to pay their respects. A constant stream of well-wishers filled the Lin residence with a lively, celebratory atmosphere.

The Lin family was neither a merchant family nor gentry. The reason everyone held them in such high regard and flattered them so was because Lin Ming was the acting Baihu of the local Jinyiwei garrison, effectively the second-in-command. The official Baihu, Liu, was old and incompetent and had long since stopped meddling in the garrison's affairs, only showing up to collect his monthly salary. In modern terms, Lin Ming was the garrison's executive leader.

After lunch, Lin Ming saw off the morning guests and had fruits and pastries set up in the inner courtyard, inviting his close relatives and friends to enjoy an opera performance.

On a temporary stage in the courtyard, a Kunqu opera was being performed by the famous actor Zhang Qiao from Nanhai County, who was renowned for his appearance and singing. The audience was captivated.

In the seat of honor sat the star of the banquet, Mrs. Lin. In Foshan, Mrs. Lin's appearance was a constant topic of discussion—a high nose, deep-set eyes, slightly curly hair, and brown eyes, bearing a five or six-tenths resemblance to a Persian beauty. And indeed, Mrs. Lin was of Semu descent. Her ancestors had also served in the Jinyiwei for generations, holding mid-to-low-ranking positions like captain, squad leader, and platoon leader. Her family was a good match for the Lin family.

According to Ming law, Semu people were not allowed to intermarry, so after three hundred years of intermingling, they were no different from the Han Chinese. It was rare to see a woman with such distinct Semu features as Mrs. Lin, which was a point of great pride for Lin Baihu. He had married her even though she was a year older than him. Everyone thought he had a unique taste.
