On the minibus ride back to the base, [Xiao Zishan][y001] kept up a steady stream of small talk, a verbal smokescreen of weather and local trivia. Whenever one of the four newcomers ventured a substantive question, he would pivot to a lament about the driver's hard life and the perils of unlicensed taxi work. The subtext was clear: *the walls have ears.*

Meng Xian stepped out of the minibus and took a deep, appreciative breath. The air here was clean, a welcome change from the city's smog. Young men in training uniforms were already unloading their luggage.

They were shown to a dormitory, a relic of the base's military past. It was spartan but clean. The room held three iron-framed bunk beds, each neatly made with a military blanket and sleeping mat. Washbasins, cups, toothbrushes, and towels were all provided, a small but thoughtful touch.

"Please, have a seat," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a practiced, leaderly smile. "The accommodations are a bit rough, I know. But where we're going, it's even rougher."

"It's better than I expected," said a man with glasses who introduced himself as Tian Jiujiu.

"We do what we can," [Xiao Zishan][y001] replied. "We have some time before D-Day. We need to be well-rested." He gestured toward the door. "Now, if you'll follow me to Building One, we'll get you registered."

The next few hours were a whirlwind of bureaucratic processing. They filled out detailed personal information forms on a computer, a comprehensive inventory of their lives and skills. The section on special skills was particularly exhaustive, a sprawling taxonomy of human capability. Next, they were herded to the infirmary, where a man in a white coat scrutinized the medical reports they had been required to bring. Their medical histories were digitized, their immunization records verified. "This is a matter of life and death," the doctor said, his voice grim. "Do not hide anything."

Finally, he gave each of them two white pills.

"What's this?" Zha Wuchu asked, eyeing the pills with suspicion.

"Deworming medicine," the doctor replied.

"I don't have worms," Zha Wuchu protested, his pride wounded.

"You're going to a place without modern sanitation," the doctor said, his tone final. "Take it."

From there, they were shuffled to the dental office. A young dentist peered into their mouths, his examination mercifully brief. Just as they were breathing a sigh of relief, he handed them three appointment slips. "Dental cleaning, the day after tomorrow at three."

Back in the registration office, still haunted by the specter of the dentist's chair, they found [Xiao Zishan][y001] waiting with a pile of metal necklaces.

"Your ID tags," he announced, distributing the chains. Each tag had a metal plate engraved with a name and serial number, and a small, sealed object that resembled a USB drive.

"Dog tags," someone muttered.

"Electronic ones," [Xiao Zishan][y001] confirmed. The USB-like object was an ID card, a key that could unlock a person's entire profile from the central database. It also functioned as an all-in-one card for the base's facilities.

"So we can use this to eat?"

"Yes. From now on, you are on a supply system," [Xiao Zishan][y001] explained. "Everything you need will be issued to you. If you want to smoke or drink, there's a small shop where you can spend your own money."

"Internet access?" Zha Wuchu asked, his voice betraying a severe addiction.

"Free. But you'll need your ID to log in."

"This is communism."

"D-Day is within the next two months," [Xiao Zishan][y001] continued, his tone growing more serious. "The Executive Committee has already briefed you on the regulations. For now, try not to leave the base. If you must, you'll need to request leave. The logistics group has already delivered your allocated items to your dorms. The Planning and Coordination Group will also be inspecting your luggage. There may be things you've forgotten, and some items will need to be contributed to the common pool." He offered a placating smile. "You will be compensated, of course.

"There will be a general assembly soon. For now, rest. Go to the internet cafe, log in, and review the internal documents. Read the plan. Think it over. If you have any doubts, if you want to quit, now is the time. All your belongings will be returned to you."

"If we wanted to quit, we wouldn't have come," someone said.

"Think it over again," [Xiao Zishan][y001] insisted. "You are about to disappear from this world. Everyone has attachments. Be certain you can leave them behind."

In the base's large conference room, the members of the Executive Committee were gathered around a table, a game of cards in progress.

"[Wen Desi][y002]" glanced out the window. "Are we being watched?" He threw down a spade.

"It seems so," said Zhong Lishi, a man who had cultivated extensive local connections. "The police department has been making inquiries."

"We're a legitimate company," Wei Aiwen said, propping his feet on a chair.

"[Ma Qianzhu][y005]" played a card. "Watching pornography isn't illegal, but you wouldn't do it in the street." He wrinkled his nose. "Have you washed your feet today?"

"We're not watching porn," Wei Aiwen retorted, his voice laced with annoyance.

"It would be 'organizing a group to watch pornography,'" [Xiao Zishan][y001] chuckled. "In the 'Strike Hard' campaign of the 80s, that would have earned you a bullet."

"Nonsense," Wei Aiwen shot back.

"The greatness of time," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said cryptically. He turned to his notebook. "I have a bad feeling. There was a suspicious man at the station yesterday."

"The legendary Ministry of State Security?"

"It's hard to say," [Xiao Zishan][y001] admitted. "He seemed particularly interested in the word 'transmigration'."

A sudden silence fell over the room.

After a moment, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] spoke. "[Director Wen][y002], should we accelerate the timeline? Most of the personnel are here."

"How much faster can we go?" [Wen Desi][y002] shuffled the cards. "We still don't have a ship."

"Can't we rent one?"

"Who would rent to a company like ours? And the cost would be nearly the same as buying a new one."

"A second-hand one, then."

"It's not like buying a used car. The paperwork is a nightmare. [Wang Luobin][y003] has been chasing his tail for two months."

"Let's just throw money at the problem," Zhong Lishi suggested. "RMB will be useless soon enough."

"We need to keep a reserve for emergencies."

"Gold and silver are the only universal currency."

"Speaking of which," someone interjected, "should we bring a supply of industrial silver? Mint our own Spanish pesos? How will we trade with the natives?"

"There was no shortage of silver in that era," [Luo Duo][y011] said dismissively. "It would be a waste of tonnage. Barter will suffice."

"Industrial production takes time!" Zhong Lishi shot back. "It will be at least three months before our factories are operational. Where will we get the funds for supplies and construction until then? Don't tell me we're going to resort to piracy."

"Have you heard of salt, my friend?" [Luo Duo][y011] said with a slow smile. "Since ancient times, salt has been a universal currency."

"And do we know how to make it?"

"We know *how* to make it. I have a mountain of data. Refined salt, iodized salt, pickling salt..." [Luo Duo][y011] grinned. "Who among us knows how to make steel? Or glass? Or a rifle? We possess the accumulated wisdom of three thousand years of civilization, all the technology of the Industrial Revolution." He made a grand, sweeping gesture. "We are omnipotent!"

His declaration, intended to be inspiring, landed with a thud. The room was silent.

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] sighed. "Why do our discussions always go off-topic?"

"Habitual digression," [Wen Desi][y002] said. "Enough. We'll deal with our financial woes later. [Zishan][y001], the new arrivals. How are they settling in?"
