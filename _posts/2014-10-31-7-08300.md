Around the first watch, Guangzhou was completely silent. Since the "髡军" entered the city, the originally somewhat relaxed night ban was tightened again. The Australian yamen posted public notices all over the city, clearly stipulating that after the first watch, no one was allowed to walk on the streets at night except those with travel permits.

As soon as the sun set, the detective team, led by a few "髡警," patrolled everywhere, urging the "street watchers" to close the street gates. The residents and shops on both sides of the main streets also received orders from the pao-chia heads to hang lanterns outside their doors after nightfall. The lights were dim and swayed under the eaves. Under the faint light, one could see large printed public notices posted on the walls at every street corner.

At the main road intersections in the city, gallows that the citizens of Guangzhou had never seen before were erected, with a few corpses hanging from them, slowly swaying in the faint light of the lanterns. Paper signs were hung around their necks, with crimes such as "robber" and "thief" written on them in ink. The captured criminals were hung up before the night was over.

For the citizens of Guangzhou, these few days were uneasy. However, since entering the city, the Fubo Army had been strictly disciplined and had not harmed a single hair, which left a deep impression on them. On the second day after the city was broken, the market had basically recovered.

However, following the traditional concept of going out less and showing one's face less during times of war and chaos, every household extinguished their lights and went to sleep as soon as the first watch began. In this silent night, a side courtyard deep in a residence in the west of the city was still lit.

The windows and doors were tightly hung with bamboo curtains, only revealing a little dim light. The hall, however, was brightly lit. On the rosewood couch in the room, a middle-aged man was leaning. He was very fat. Because he was at home, he was dressed very casually, in a Taoist robe made of Western cloth, with a net gauze on his head, and a pair of purple-edged Chenqiao straw sandals. He leaned against a large Nanjing satin pillow, holding a Xiangfei bamboo and Han jade-mouthed pipe in his hand, silently smoking. The blue and white smoke drifted, like his thoughts, swaying, not knowing where to go.

Two maids, one standing behind him and one kneeling in front of him, gently pounded his legs and kneaded his shoulders. However, this did not seem to make him feel comfortable. On the small Japanese lacquer table in front of him were all kinds of exquisite "mouth fruits." But they seemed untouched. The Hangzhou Mingqian tea in the teacup, which cost several taels of silver for a tael, had already gone completely cold.

A man dressed as a master secretary sat diagonally opposite him, looking at him with some fear. It was the first time he had ever encountered his master being "helpless."

On the table between them was a notice. The paper and ink of the notice were still very new. It was clear that it had not been posted for long. The common Song typeface on it indicated its origin: the newly entered Australians.

"Master, the night is deep. Tomorrow..." The master secretary probably felt that too much time had passed and couldn't help but break the silence in the room.

The middle-aged man called "Master" was Mo Rongxin, the head of the Wenlan Academy.

The notice was brought by Shi Tidi, the accounting master secretary of his academy. Although Shi Tidi was the accounting master secretary of the Wenlan Academy, he was actually Mo Rongxin's private secretary. Mo Rongxin did not usually go to the academy. All the income and expenditure of the academy's property were handled by this Master Shi. Naturally, besides Master Mo, he was the one most concerned about the income and expenditure of the Wenlan Academy's property—he not only received a reward of one hundred and twenty taels of silver every year, but also five or six hundred taels from various fraudulent accounts and kickbacks. This was a great fortune!

Today, the shopkeepers of more than a dozen shops on Chengxuan Avenue that rented the storefronts of the Wenlan Academy came to find him, and they also brought this notice: the Australians had already posted notices everywhere, limiting the demolition of the sheds on Chengxuan Avenue within twelve hours.

Although they were called sheds, the ones built by these few families were long no longer "sheds." They were almost "houses." Not to mention that it cost a lot of money to build them, if they were demolished, the shop space would be much smaller. Not to mention the inconvenience of doing business, many money-making tools and goods would have to be stored elsewhere. The shopkeepers had no idea what to do and all came to find the landlord for a solution.

Shi Tidi naturally had no solution to think of. If there were difficulties in the past, he would take his master's card to the county or prefectural yamen to "chat" with the clerks or master secretaries, and the problem could be solved by spending some silver. Now, not only had the officials changed, but the whole set of things he was familiar with was gone. He didn't even know where the yamen gate opened. In his panic, he had no choice but to come to Mo Rongxin for a solution.

"What can we do? There's nothing we can do!" Mo Rongxin blew out a puff of smoke and put the pipe aside. He turned to get up, and the maid beside him quickly supported his arm, using all her strength to help him up.

Mo Rongxin picked up the cold tea and drank a big gulp, sighing, "Now that the Australians have just entered the city, this Master Liu is a new official. If you try to stop them from doing what they want, you're looking for death! You go and tell them, if they want to hang themselves, they can go by themselves tomorrow. I'm not going to be their scapegoat!"

Shi Tidi gave a dry laugh and said, "Master is right. But the academy has many shops on Chengxuan Avenue. If all the sheds are demolished, the loss will not be small. If there is a way to turn things around, they are willing to spend some money to deal with it."

"They are willing, but I am not," Mo Rongxin said. "Now the 髡贼 are worried that no one will jump out to be their scapegoat, so they can't kill people to establish their authority. Whoever wants to show their face can go!"

Shi Tidi was not willing to let go of the opportunity to get benefits and continued to instigate, "Master, should we discuss this matter with Master Gao of the Guan Di Temple?"

This was Mo Rongxin's most powerful "trump card." He had relied on the people of the Guan Di Temple to settle several major crises. Although he had gained the ugly name of "beggar in-law" for this, the benefits were not small.

"You think it's easy!" Mo Rongxin said. "The 髡贼 are not fools. As soon as the people of the Guan Di Temple come out, they will immediately think that we are playing tricks. If they can't deal with the people of the Guan Di Temple, won't it be a piece of cake for them to deal with us?"

"So..." Shi Tidi was a little disappointed—it seemed that this "thank you money" was not going to be obtained.

"You go and tell the shopkeepers: don't look for connections blindly. Just demolish it yourself honestly. At least you can recover some of the cost. When that group of black-hearted yamen runners starts tomorrow, I guarantee that not even a brick will be left. It's getting late. You can rest here for a night and go early tomorrow morning. Go."

Seeing that the master had issued an order to see him off, Shi Tidi had no choice but to stand up and leave. Mo Rongxin suddenly thought of something and asked, "How is the academy recently?"

"These few days, the 髡贼 have entered the city. The headmaster, students, and others have not come to the academy. The students living in the academy are still quiet."

"You go and keep a close eye on the head cook. Don't let him just know how to eat and take things for himself. The food in the academy is almost like pig food. From tomorrow on, there must be meat in the meals every day—not just some bones and chicken racks to make soup, but whole chickens, ducks, and whole fish! The rice must be enough! Do you understand?!"

"Yes, yes," Shi Tidi was startled. He was also involved in the matter of cutting back on the food.

"Don't lose a big thing for a small one. Are those sour scholars easy to get along with? You are so messy, they have long been full of complaints," Mo Rongxin said calmly, fanning himself, and decided to "point" him out today. "Now that the Australians are the emperor, we must prevent them from taking the opportunity to make trouble. At that time, I will not know anything..."

Shi Tidi quickly said, "I know. I will arrange it when I go back tomorrow."

In another courtyard of the same mansion, Mo Rongxin's fifth daughter-in-law, Gao Huichun, was sitting alone in her room embroidering. She was a young woman in her twenties and had been married into the Mo family for five years. Before dinner today, she heard a maid come to report that the fifth master had something to do tonight and would be resting in the outer study. He told her not to wait for him to go to bed. Although she had no expression at the time, she was very unhappy in her heart. She knew that her husband was resting in a maid's room again.

Among the officials and wealthy people, it was common for a man to have several concubines. Even among the beggar chiefs led by her father, some also had several concubines. Her father not only had more than a dozen women around him, but he also often went to the flower boats for pleasure and did not return all night.

When she was engaged to the Mo family, although she was happy to be able to marry into a "scholarly family," when she heard that her future husband already had a concubine, she was a little unhappy at the time.

At the beginning of their marriage, they were still quite loving. However, as time went by, especially after she had not given birth to a son, her husband's love for her gradually declined, and the days he spent in her room became fewer and fewer. If it weren't for her father-in-law's concern for her father's face, and the fear that a quarrel between the young couple would be detrimental to the maintenance of the relationship between the two families, he would have forced his son to come to her room to spend the night every few days. It would have been good if he could come two or three days a month.

Not returning tonight, she immediately understood in her heart: he was using the excuse of having something to do to spend the spring night with the maid he had recently hooked up with.

This so-called "scholarly family," her father-in-law, Mo Rongxin, was himself a greedy and lustful person. He kept four or five thirteen-year-old maids around him all year round for his pleasure; his several sons were no less than their father. They all had wives and concubines in groups, and they also visited brothels and flower boats... Although her husband was the fifth son of a concubine and had no status in the family, he also had several maids in his room.

As the legal wife, she was not willing to show her "pettiness" about this matter in front of the maids, but a different kind of pain in her heart could not be shaken off. She thought, "It's really hard to be a woman. Even before I get old and my beauty fades, such things have already happened!" Even talking to the maids and listening to the blind girl sing did not reduce the pain in her heart.

It was already the first watch outside. She put down her embroidery and listened to the desolate sound of the clapper outside. Thinking of her own situation and the various encounters in this large family in the past five years, she was filled with all kinds of feelings. Her eyes couldn't help but sting, and she almost shed tears.

But she didn't dare to let out a sigh, and even swallowed her sobs, for fear of being heard by her personal maids and maids, which would cause more trouble.
