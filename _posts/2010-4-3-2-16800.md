"Hmph, this last point is the ultimate weapon against corruption," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said with considerable satisfaction, as he was the one who had formulated this clause. "All those fellows planning to engage in corruption and take on multiple wives and concubines will be exposed!"

The crowd fell silent, feeling that relying on such a method to fight corruption was not very reliable. There was also a sense of unease among them—did this mean that having coupons or gold and silver at home would make one a criminal of corruption and bribery?

However, anti-corruption was a universally accepted fig leaf, and no one could object—objecting would be tantamount to admitting one intended to facilitate their own corruption. Although many felt it was improper, they tacitly accepted the clause for the time being.

Next, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] brought up the issue of establishing ranks and grades. These issues were directly linked to the transmigrators' salaries and ranks. In the past, salaries and allowances were just numbers, not worth much discussion. But now that the amount of point-coupons was directly tied to consumption, it became a highly sensitive issue.

"I propose we follow the model of the People's Republic of China's 1956 system and adopt a 24-grade administrative ranking," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] continued. "With an administrative ranking system, the issue of military ranks for officers can also be settled! The advantage of this system is that the difference between grades is not large, with the largest gap being 50 yuan and the smallest only 5 yuan. Moreover, issues like various allowances, subsidies, and rewards can also be determined. We now have a General Office; without a ranking system, it's hard to manage everyone's living standards—"

"That 24-grade system ranges from a maximum of 590 yuan to a minimum of 45 yuan. Are you suggesting that the frontline transmigrators get only 45 yuan? They'd eat you alive," [Luo Duo][y011] immediately objected. He had these figures memorized.

"Of course, transmigrators won't be placed at the lowest grade," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] had clearly considered this issue. "Transmigrators are a precious asset. We can set a minimum starting grade, for example, starting from grade 12..."

"I don't think this is appropriate," [Wen Desi][y002] stood up. "[Commissar][y005], you need to consider our system. At least among the transmigrators, implementing a 24-grade system right now is not suitable. In the past, this administrative grade was for life; even if you lost your position, you still enjoyed the same treatment. But our Executive Committee is elected. What if you, as a member of the Executive Committee, enjoy administrative grade 3, and then you lose the next election? Do you still enjoy grade 3? If not, do you go back to being a common person at grade 12?"

"That goes without saying. The grade follows the position. That's the principle. We won't have a system where you keep the benefits after leaving the post."

"Hard to say! The starting point is always good, but look at our original time. How many people in government offices 'enjoyed the benefits of XX grade' without doing any work!"

"I agree. Once people get used to a high salary, they will definitely have complaints if it's lowered. It's hard to go from extravagance to simplicity."

The expanded meeting of the Executive Committee was noisy and chaotic. Most people opposed [Ma Qianzhu][y005]'s ranking proposal, while some supported it. Regardless of their stance, everyone knew that under [Ma Qianzhu][y005]'s plan, those present would be the biggest beneficiaries. After all, the higher one's administrative position, the greater the advantage in the ranking. The question was: would the ordinary transmigrators agree to the administrative cadres unilaterally setting high benefits for themselves? The supporters and opponents clearly had different assessments of the masses' attitude.

"What the hell is this! Are we in Yong'an City?" A sudden shout silenced everyone. "The Taiping rebels at least had Yong'an county town. We haven't even entered Lingao county town yet. And we're already talking about benefits? Do you all want to end up like the Heavenly King Hong?" Everyone looked and saw that the speaker was Ying Yu, the head of the New Army's artillery.

Yu E'shui stood up and said, "[Commissar][y005], I don't think this matter is urgent at all. If our revolution succeeds, the entire world will be the property of the Transmigrator collective. Will any transmigrator still care about how much salary they receive?"

Seeing that the atmosphere was not right, [Ma Qianzhu][y005] quickly withdrew his motion. "Since everyone thinks the time is not yet ripe, let's discuss it again later."

Only then did Cheng Dong slowly stand up and say, "Everyone, please calm down. Since we are continuing with the supply system, the salary portion will be issued according to the original standard without any adjustments. The income in the salary accounts will be a book figure. Only the allowances will be issued as physical point-coupons—allowances are easier to calculate and define, and there will be fewer objections."

"What about the point-coupons we've already invested in the cooperative or spent?"

"What's spent has been deducted from your account. There's no dispute about that," Cheng Dong said. "We are not freezing everyone's salary accounts, just not giving you physical point-coupons. If you need to use them, you can go to the grain company to handle the withdrawal procedures."

This was essentially a form of compulsory savings, but it was better than implementing a 24-grade system that would create significant salary disparities and divisions among the transmigrators.

As for the allowance issue, the plan was much simpler. Each transmigrator, regardless of position, age, or work, would receive a daily allowance of 1 point-coupon as a food supplement.

Those serving as officers in the New Army would receive an additional 2 point-coupons per day. During wartime, a wartime allowance would be issued. In addition, personnel on ships at sea would receive a sea-duty allowance.

Those engaged in heavy physical labor, chemical work, or hazardous jobs would receive a job-specific allowance of 1-5 point-coupons per day, depending on the difficulty and danger.

Health personnel would receive a daily health subsidy of 5 point-coupons per person.

Those engaged in fieldwork such as exploration, construction, investigation, reconnaissance, and surveying within the transmigrators' sphere of influence would receive a daily fieldwork allowance.

Those traveling on official business to areas controlled by the transmigrator regime, such as Damei and the salt fields, would receive a daily travel allowance.

Those engaged in various activities on official business in the county town and other areas not controlled by the transmigrators would receive a daily danger allowance. The danger allowance was divided into three levels based on the degree of risk. The personnel of the Guangzhou Forward Station would receive the third and highest level of danger allowance.

The new allowance system better reflected the spirit of favoring frontline workers. In the past, the frontline transmigrators had many complaints—after all, while you were forging steel under the scorching sun, standing guard on a pitch-black night, or teaching listless native children in a village without water or electricity, someone else was comfortably drinking tea and reading the "Lingao Times" in an office in Bairen City. They would even get to the canteen earlier and pick the best fish fillets. The heads of various departments were all under pressure from their subordinates. The adjusted allowance system was a good way to alleviate such conflicts.

"I have another question." Mei Wan, who had been low-key in the expanded meetings, was now the general manager of the construction company and feeling quite spirited. "We have a man in our company, Zhuo Tianmin, who has his son with him—"

"A dependent?" [Ma Qianzhu][y005] thought for a moment. "Aren't they all provided for like ordinary transmigrators? Are they having financial difficulties?"

"Dependents" referred to those who were transmigrators but lacked the ability to work, basically the children and elderly parents of the transmigrators. Although they also held shares from participating in the transmigration, they did not receive a salary because they did not work.

"It's not that they're in financial difficulty, but he's always distracted at work—there's no one to look after his child, and there are no schools here," Mei Wan said. "I propose we give him a child allowance so he can hire a local girl from the commune to look after the child."

"Childcare is not a problem. Just have him send his son to the commune headquarters. I'll have Chu Qing look after him. She has the time and is reliable."

"The problem is that Zhuo Tianmin is not the only one with a child. The North American group mentioned this to me last time as well," [Xiao Zishan][y001] remembered. "It's not as simple as just finding someone to watch the child. You have to educate them too, right?"

[Wen Desi][y002] said, "Education is a problem we can't solve for now. How many children are there in total? Can we spare the people to open a separate school for them?"

"Currently, among the dependents, there are 5 children between the ages of 5 and 13," [Xiao Zishan][y001] had these figures at his fingertips. "Starting a school is a bit troublesome, but a nursery is feasible."

"No, we can start a school even with just 5 students," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said after some careful thought. "The education of the transmigrators' children will have to be put on the agenda eventually. It's better to address it now than to wait until it becomes a problem."

"We now have a very basic primary school for universal education. But this education is too rudimentary. I think we can establish a special school for our children, educating them according to the scientific and cultural standards of the 21st century. In addition to the transmigrators' children, we can also admit some gifted native children to be educated together. This would not only provide companionship for our children but also cultivate future local successors."

"Which native children should we select?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] asked, jotting down [Ma Qianzhu][y005]'s words in his notebook.

"The children of our most dedicated collaborators, as a form of reward—"

"No, we can't do that," [Wen Desi][y002] objected. "In my opinion, the school can admit native children, but only those under the age of 7, who are orphans and can't even say where their homes are—preferably those who have suffered a lot. They have no blood or hometown ties to this era, and may even resent the people and events of this time. After being adopted and educated by us, they will become 'our children' one hundred percent, from their way of thinking to their knowledge, a complete replica of us."

"So, they would be like our adopted children," said Dr. Zhong Lishi.

[Wen Desi][y002] said, "That's right. Aren't you all thinking of raising lolis to be your future wives? The principle is the same."

"Then can I commission the school to raise a loli for me?" Li Yunxing, the general manager of Lingao Telecom, his eyes shining, asked. "I'll pay the tuition!"

"Of course, you can. But she must meet the conditions I mentioned. Otherwise, if external influences cause her to betray the revolution, the losses would be immeasurable."

"You're so ruthless," someone commented on [Wen Desi][y002].

"I think the General Office should be in charge of this matter," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] felt the weight of the responsibility. This was clearly going to be the Jingshan School of their time. Wouldn't that make him directly responsible? "Is that appropriate? Shouldn't this fall under the Ministry of Education?"

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] said, "The Ministry of Education is for national basic education. This concerns our next generation. It's better for the General Office to manage it directly."
