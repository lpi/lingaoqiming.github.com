Li Luoyou's commercial network and economic strength were much greater than those of the scattered small merchants, and his channels were much wider than those of Gao Ju, who basically relied on selling foreign goods. His goods were not only large in quantity but also had a great price advantage. So it didn't take long for the Qionghai to become the largest mainland supplier in Lin'gao's commercial system. Therefore, Gu Baocheng's business was basically just collecting money. However, Li Luoyou gave him full freedom in purchasing goods. He could decide on half of the Qionghai's monthly purchase amount in Lin'gao, choosing things that he thought could make money on the mainland.

The siege launched by the Guangdong authorities had interrupted the Qionghai's business for a period. Not long after the great victory at Chengmai, Gu Baocheng, who had never left Lin'gao, quickly resumed bilateral trade and made a lot of money, which made Li Luoyou a little more confident in his business ability.

Li Luoyou attached great importance to the development of the Qionghai. The money to open the Qionghai was his "private stash," or so-called private money. Although he was immensely wealthy, it was all the Li family's property, and Gu Baocheng was, after all, an outsider. To avoid gossip from the clan members and to prepare for the possibility that he might not be around—he had to give Gu Baocheng a business to support himself. The existing properties, whether physical or shares, were all coveted by the clan members. Even his own son might not be able to inherit everything, let alone his nephew.

Now that the Australians had fully demonstrated their capabilities and their determination to defend themselves, from this point of view, the current Lin'gao, and the future Qiongzhou Prefecture, was not a bad choice as a "retreat." Li Luoyou was increasingly pessimistic about the situation in the Central Plains and the future of the Great Ming. The shadow of the coming chaotic times weighed heavily on his mind.

This time he came to Lin'gao, he had both the mission of negotiating with Li Fengjie and the intention of properly managing the Qionghai. If the world fell into chaos, this small southern island might not be a bad place to be a paradise.

The carriage arrived at the entrance of the Qionghai. The two servants at the door hurried forward to hold the horses. Due to the steps, the carriage could only stop outside the door and could not be carried into the house like a sedan chair. Li Luoyou secretly made a note in his mind: he had to remind Gu Baocheng to renovate the house and set up a gate that could accommodate a carriage.

He had already instructed Gu Baocheng to buy a carriage from the Australians for his use. As for the necessary horses or mules, he would send people to transport them from the mainland.

"Isn't it too ostentatious for your nephew to use such a carriage..." Gu Baocheng was startled. This Red Flag carriage was rarely seen on the streets of Lin'gao. Even the Ao-Song Elders in Lin'gao rarely rode in them. They not only didn't ride in carriages, but they also didn't ride in sedan chairs. They either walked or rode iron-wheeled vehicles. It didn't seem right for him, a mere shopkeeper, to be so ostentatious.

"It's fine," Li Luoyou said. "You are now the dignified shopkeeper of the Qionghai. You must have the proper decorum."

The Qionghai was located far from the center of East Gate Market. In modern terms, it was on the outer ring of East Gate Market. The reason for choosing this location was the cheap land price and the large space for future development. Furthermore, the Qionghai was mainly engaged in trade and did not have high requirements for the market.

Although the location was a bit remote and the storefront was not large, the entire Qionghai building was very well-renovated. It was built according to the traditional ancient "Yingzao Fashi" (Building Standards), but also incorporated many Australian-style amenities, such as glass windows, bathrooms with hot and cold water, and flushing toilets. Li Luoyou particularly admired the Australians' bathroom facilities. In traditional houses, no matter how luxurious, the toilet was always a place that was difficult to set foot in. No matter how much expensive incense you burned, the stench was always lingering.

A small garden was built in the Qionghai—this garden was a "modern-style" classical garden designed by Li Xiaolv. However, it was very much to Li Luoyou's taste. The two changed their clothes and talked in the waterside pavilion in this garden.

He had roughly read the account book that Gu Baocheng had given him. There was a large surplus of circulation coupons on the books, which were now all deposited in the Delong Bank. Gu Baocheng's intention was to reduce exports to Lin'gao and increase imports from Lin'gao recently in order to digest the bank deposits as soon as possible.

He had always been very skeptical about the creditworthiness of this paper money. After all, it was not real gold and silver. Even copper coins felt more substantial than this stuff.

Li Luoyou listened to his thoughts and pondered for a long time.

"There is no hurry to use this surplus," Li Luoyou said. "You must have a plan. The Qionghai will be your property in the future. This is your world. You should think more about how to use this money locally."

Gu Baocheng couldn't think of any other way to use the money besides increasing the quantity of goods he purchased. The Qionghai's building was already large enough, and there was no need to expand it. As for the land he had hoarded, he felt it was also sufficient. There was still a large area of wasteland he had bought around the Qionghai that was being used to grow vegetables. Although vegetables sold well in Lin'gao, they were not worth much. It was a bit of a waste to spend a lot of money to buy land and let it sit in the sun.

"It's not a waste. Hasn't the price of the land you bought gone up again?" Li Luoyou smiled. "The Australians have only just begun to exert their strength in Lin'gao. The price of land will only rise, not fall."

He instructed Gu Baocheng to keep a portion of the circulation coupons obtained from sales in his hands and not to exchange them all for goods to be transported to the mainland. The remaining cash would be used to continue buying land—the land price in Lin'gao was currently the fastest rising in the areas under Australian rule, especially near East Gate Market. This place, originally positioned as a town outside Bairen City for trade with the natives, was now expanding very rapidly, with a momentum that threatened to engulf Bairen City. Many Elders were already tired of living in Bairen City. It was too noisy, and they were often disturbed by industrial waste gas and noise.

"Master, although the land price has risen, it can't be sold for a while. There's a price but no market..."

"Of course. There is still vacant land in the inner circle of East Gate Market, so the land here naturally cannot be sold. When the land in the inner circle is full, will it still be impossible to sell? If you buy more, the land will naturally become scarce. When supply cannot meet demand, people will come to buy your land."

"Master's teachings are wise," Gu Baocheng said quickly.

As for the remaining money, it would be temporarily saved and spent when there was an opportunity. He had not yet decided how to use it.

"Also, you must do more good deeds," Li Luoyou said. "Donate some to the church. The church in Lin'gao is a new parish. Although it has the help of the Jesuits, it lacks foundation and property. Father Wu is running a seminary and a charity, so his expenses must be very large."

"Yes, your nephew donates a sum of money to the church every month..."

"And the various charities run by the Australians, and their schools, you must also donate some money to them—not much, but you must give to all of them. Don't miss any."

"Your nephew understands."

Li Luoyou nodded. "It's easy to make money in Lin'gao. So you must build good relationships to live here for a long time in peace."

As they were talking, they suddenly heard that an Australian had come to visit. Li Luoyou's spirits lifted. It was probably the Council of Elders who had finally reached a conclusion on the negotiations. He had been in Lin'gao for more than ten days, waiting for an official reception from the Australians to start the talks.

"Please come in!" he ordered loudly. "Serve tea in the main hall!"

Just as the servant was about to turn and leave, he asked, "Who is it?"

"Elder Liu is among them. I don't recognize the others."

Elder Liu was Liu San. Liu San's presence was, of course, not for negotiations, but to make Li Luoyou feel that there was a familiar face present, making the atmosphere more relaxed.

The person in charge of the negotiations was Xu Tianqi from the Foreign Affairs Department. The interests of the transmigrator group in Guangdong had already been specified in the "Macau Treaty." This negotiation was just a mopping-up job. Xu Tianqi's task was simply to inform Li Luoyou of the conditions discussed by the Council of Elders and the Foreign Affairs Department.

Xu Tianqi was also an acquaintance of Li Luoyou. When they were first received, Xu Tianqi was mainly responsible for the negotiations with Jerome.

After the pleasantries were exchanged, the servants served tea. Xu Tianqi looked around. He felt that the main hall was too spacious and not suitable for a secret talk.

Seeing him looking around, Li Luoyou knew that he had probably brought the negotiation conditions and was looking for a secret place to talk. He immediately instructed that the group be led to his study. This was a courtyard in the deepest part of the Qionghai, and besides Gu Baocheng, ordinary servants and clerks were not allowed to enter.

The conditions proposed by Xu Tianqi on behalf of the Council of Elders were:

The Guangdong authorities would acquiesce to the transmigrator group's occupation of the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture and the exercise of its dominion. In return:

The Council of Elders would guarantee that the Great Ming's personnel appointments to Qiongzhou Prefecture and its subordinate counties could continue. In other words, the Great Ming could still normally appoint and dismiss officials at all levels in Qiongzhou Prefecture. At the same time, the Council of Elders would guarantee the personal and property safety of the officials and their families.

The Council of Elders would guarantee the full completion of the official tax quota for the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture—including the supplementary taxes and additional levies from the Ministry of Revenue. However, supplementary taxes from the province would not be paid.

The Ming army garrisons in Qiongzhou could continue to be maintained on the premise of goodwill. The Council of Elders would guarantee the personal and property safety of the Baisha Water Fortress, the Haikou Guard, and Tang Yunwen himself and his subordinates.

All civil and military officials and soldiers besieged in Qiongshan County would be repatriated to the mainland in batches by the Ao-Song Navy, starting from the date of the signing of the treaty. The repatriation location would be designated by the Guangdong side. The officers and soldiers of the Baisha Water Fortress, Haikou, and other local guards in Qiongzhou would each return to their posts, and the Fubo Army would not obstruct them.

The repatriated personnel could carry weapons, baggage, flags, and 10 days' rations. They were not allowed to carry gunpowder, cannons, livestock, or grain and fodder. Officers of the rank of major and above could take back their own horses. Both officers and soldiers could take back their own private property—limited to ten kilograms. The ships left behind by the government troops, if they belonged to the Baisha Water Fortress, would be returned to the Baisha Water Fortress. All other ships would be confiscated.
