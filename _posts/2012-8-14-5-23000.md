Even from the ship, one could see a series of fortresses built by the Nguyễn along the coastline, especially at strategic points and locations suitable for ships to dock. Fortresses built by the Nguyễn were everywhere, many of them European-style. Although their scale and materials had a distinct "monkey version" character, it was undeniable that the Nguyễn's "Westernization" in military thought and technology was much more radical than that of the Ming Dynasty.

In this Vietnamese North-South dynastic struggle, not only did European colonialists active in Southeast Asia participate, but Chinese pirates also mixed in, providing naval forces for both the Nguyễn and Trịnh sides, fighting with great enthusiasm. Both sides毫不吝惜地 showered the pirates with various "official positions," "titles," and "imperial patents"—after all, the cost was just a piece of paper, a wooden seal, and an ill-fitting official robe. In return, they could get countless men and ships to fight for them. Why not? As for payment, it was the freedom to plunder the wealth of the enemy's territory.

Ping Qiusheng suddenly remembered something. "Orderly! Order Wang You to report to the poop deck immediately!"

Wang You, who had surrendered during the Battle of the Pearl River Estuary, was originally in the logistics training class at the Maniao base, studying logistics—he had been the chief administrator of a pirate group's main camp, responsible for logistics, so it was a perfect match for his expertise. This time, for the trip to Southeast Asia, naturalized citizens familiar with the Southeast Asian environment were selected from the entire military system, and Wang You was temporarily transferred.

"You've been here with Zheng Bao before, haven't you?" Ping Qiusheng asked Wang You bluntly.

"Yes, sir!" Wang You's standing at attention was not very standard. Although he had been a pirate, he was essentially a scholar who wielded a pen, and he was also older, so the effectiveness of his "regularization" training was far less than that of his peers. The naval uniform looked a bit like the Western-style clothes worn by the patriots of the Meiji Restoration on him.

Wang You looked at the familiar coastline. He briefly described his "combat" experience in this area with Zheng Bao's fleet—"combat" meant burning, killing, and looting. At first, it was a very good business. The Nguyễn had few defenses on this coastline, and the fleet easily captured many ships and plundered a large amount of wealth. Apart from a portion paid to the Trịnh, the rest belonged to the fleet.

But gradually, this coastline became harder to crack. There were more and more forts and beacon towers. Not only did they often have to land under fire, but they also sometimes encountered the Nguyễn's fleet, leading to fierce battles with heavy losses of men and ships.

It was precisely because this business became increasingly dangerous that Zheng Bao had the idea of returning to Guangdong.

"How many Ming pirates are still fighting for the Trịnh and Nguyễn now?"

"Reporting! I don't know the exact number. Last year, when Zheng Bao was recruiting sailors and ships in Jiangping, there were still more than thirty gangs fighting for the Trịnh. They were all given official titles."

The number of these pirate gangs and their men and ships changed frequently. Whether for the Trịnh or the Nguyễn, the Chinese pirates under their command were considered "righteous armies." They were neither inspected nor paid. They were only given nominal titles to harass the other side. Except for a few large-scale battles, they rarely gathered for unified command. As for coming and going, they were free to do as they pleased. So, when the summer typhoon season arrived, these pirates basically all retreated to the Chinese coast.

As for the Chinese pirates fighting for the Nguyễn, there were far fewer of them—relatively speaking, the Nguyễn were farther away, making it difficult to replenish men and ships. However, he had heard of and had dealings with more than a dozen gangs at sea. But he also said that many pirates had received titles from both sides and often switched allegiances to profit from the chaotic situation.

Of course, many also died in the process of seeking gold. Wang You knew of several former managers under Zhu Cailao who had met their end here. So, seeing this place again, he couldn't help but feel a sense of sorrow for his own kind.

Quark often traveled through this area and had heard a lot about the war. He pointed to some buildings deep on the coastline. "Those are the Annamese granaries. I heard there are many more inland, the largest being at the east gate of Hue. God bless, these barbarians have been killing each other for years, and the Portuguese are involved. They have stockpiled a lot of grain, but I estimate that if they keep killing each other like this, soon there will be no one left to eat it."

"Are the firearms they use provided by the Portuguese?" Ping Qiusheng asked. He saw a large number of forts and batteries, which should all be equipped with cannons. The total number must be staggering.

"The Portuguese set up a foundry in Hue a long time ago, casting cannons and cannonballs. They can also produce matchlocks. They've made a lot of money!" Quark said with envy. As a merchant, he was well-informed about such news. He had always been envious and jealous of this—what in the world was more valuable than arms? He had been very enthusiastic when Li Luoyou had wanted to cooperate with him to set up a cannon foundry.

Quark explained enthusiastically, still hoping that Ping Qiusheng would agree to his request for the "Australian sea charts." Although the sea charts that Liu San had shown him were restricted items, the Council of Elders had already printed a batch of small-scale latitude and longitude charts as gifts for commercial partners with whom they had extensive trade.

Ping Qiusheng looked at the distant buildings and thought, *This grain should have belonged to the transmigration group. If it weren't for the North-South civil war, the grain supply in Vietnam wouldn't be so tight.* Although the local coastal defenses were well-organized, their level of fortification was at best slightly better than the Ming's forts at Humen. While Zheng Bao and his ilk found them difficult to crack, they were no problem for them. If the fleet had a company of marines and a few special reconnaissance teams, plus a few H800 Harmony-class ships, it would be no problem to snatch seventy or eighty thousand shi of grain. But that was out of the question for now. The Engine Project had already stretched Lin'gao's resources thin, and many large-scale operations had been postponed until next year. The proposal to rob the monkeys of their grain would probably not be approved by the Council of Elders anytime soon.

Ping Qiusheng noticed a natural reef offshore that separated the harbor, and the anchorage conditions inside were quite good. At this time, the people on shore seemed to have noticed the arrival of the fleet and lit a warning smoke signal, but no ships left the port to investigate. Apparently, the other side did not have a standing navy ready for combat at all times. They relied on their coastal defense system to prevent landings and raids.

A little further south was Da Nang, and the mouth of the Han River was already visible. This was the dividing line of Han cultural influence on the Indochinese Peninsula. In this era, Vietnam had not yet pushed its borders south to the sea. In the eyes of the Vietnamese court, the area south of the Han River was inhabited by "savages," a territory for them to "civilize" and "conquer."

After two days of sailing, the fleet arrived in the waters of Nha Trang. Ping Qiusheng ordered the fleet to anchor here and sent a small team ashore to get fresh water, firewood, and food. The landing team caused a little panic among the local residents.

The local villagers sent two elders with some food and water to inquire about the intentions of the landing party. Ping Qiusheng had learned some Vietnamese, but when it came to communication, he found that his "300 sentences of Vietnamese" were completely useless. Southern Vietnam at that time did not use Chinese characters, and modern Vietnamese, based on the French alphabet, was also useless for communication. The strange pronunciations were clearly a dialect from the Austronesian region.

The emissary from the village could actually speak a little Chinese—of course, with a strange accent. Only former pirates like Wang You, who had been to this area before, could understand him. After trying himself, Elder Ping gave up and let the former pirate, a naturalized citizen familiar with the area, translate. After a mixture of gestures, local dialect, and Chinese, both sides roughly understood each other's intentions.

Ping Qiusheng gave the villagers some common trade gifts: glass beads and a few machetes. He requested a supply of clean drinking water and food. The fleet could pay with the daily necessities they carried. Ping Qiusheng also gave the representative a small glass mirror, and the villagers returned with profuse thanks. That same day, they brought rice, chickens, ducks, and many fruits and vegetables.

Fearing an attack by the Nguyễn army, the entire party only camped on higher ground on the shore, and some people were left on the ships as guards. But the Elder had clearly overestimated the Nguyễn's control. As a newly conquered territory from the Champa kingdom, they did not show much control. Their limited forces were clearly all deployed to the northern front. The local villagers, who were the indigenous people, had some experience. Having been through wars, pirates, and European fleets, they knew that these outsiders were not to be trifled with.

Since they understood the disparity in strength, they could only cooperate with the various maritime forces that appeared in this area, apart from being on guard. Now, it seemed that the Australians were very polite, so the villagers were willing to cooperate with them as much as possible.

During the few days they stayed in Nha Trang, Lin Dan and his former "colleagues" enjoyed the beach here. The scenery of Nha Trang was beautiful, and the Americans had good taste in choosing it as a base.

In Ping Qiusheng's mind, Nha Trang would be the future forward base for thetransmigrators in Southeast Asia, and also a choice for an Elder resort.

The long-range exploration team that came with the ship took a small boat to conduct a hydrographic survey in Cam Ranh Bay, south of Nha Trang. This natural harbor with excellent hydrographic conditions was an excellent naval base and commercial port. In the future, the commercial and military stronghold built around Cam Ranh Bay and Nha Trang should have very good development.

South of Cam Ranh Bay was not Vietnamese territory but the land of the Champa kingdom. While fighting the northern offensive, the Nguyễn dynasty continued to "expand its territory" southward, constantly compressing the former Champa kingdom in this area, pushing the remnants of Champa's power south of Cam Ranh Bay. Historically, Champa's territory extended from Phan Ri to Hue. But now, Champa's power was only left in the Phan Ri area, and it was only because of the mutual attacks and containment of the Vietnamese North and South dynasties that they could continue to survive for a few more decades.
