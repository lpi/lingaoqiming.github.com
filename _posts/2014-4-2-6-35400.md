These hand-copied books were also considered legal publications locally, a sort of pocket edition—because the Lingao printing press didn't yet have the special small-sized lead type. Some people exploited this loophole, creating these hand-copied booklets and then deliberately acting suspiciously to attract newcomers to Lingao who were unfamiliar with the situation and desperate to get certified. They would then use a few shills to lure people into their trap.

Legally speaking, the bookstore sold legitimate publications at clearly marked prices, without any overcharging. Hand-copied books were naturally more expensive than printed ones, so the pricing wasn't an issue either. Therefore, no laws were broken. Furthermore, buying exam questions and answers was, in itself, an attempt to cheat—a matter one couldn't openly complain about. Combined with the limited amount of money involved, those who were deceived could only swallow their losses.

"I see..." Huang Zhen nodded repeatedly.

He quickly added, "Yes, yes, that's why I'd like to ask for your guidance, Director." He added another sentence, "I will never forget this kindness."

"Oh, don't mention it, Director, kindness, you're too kind. We are all serving the Senate." The hostess bloomed with a smile. She was not yet forty, and not from a poor background. Her appearance and skin were well-maintained, and she could be described as still having her charm. "My name is You Xiu, you can just call me Xiu'er." As she spoke, she picked up a thermos to refill Huang Zhen's cup, her full, firm chest brushing against his arm.

Huang Zhen felt a resilient, full object press firmly against his arm, and his heart skipped a beat. He was no novice; how could he not understand "Xiu'er's" intentions? Huang Zhen was in his middle years and a widower. To say he had no needs in that department would be a lie. This You Xiu was not bad-looking. Although there were slight wrinkles at the corners of her eyes, the charm of a mature woman had a different flavor compared to the innocence of a young girl.

However, martial artists were most wary of licentious matters. Adultery was an even greater taboo, not to mention their current circumstances...

Huang Zhen suppressed this fanciful thought. If they were in Ming territory, he would have put on a straight face and said, "Sister-in-law You, please have some respect." But here and now, he couldn't say such a thing. He could only play dumb, chuckling and taking another sip of tea, feigning an air of cluelessness.

You Xiu, however, wasn't annoyed. She just spoke some polite pleasantries, telling Huang Zhen to go back and tell everyone to "review well," and then suggested, "Why not get the B-level literacy certificate first? It will be useful in the future." Huang Zhen was getting anxious. The Director's words were all official platitudes, with no hint of "giving guidance." He knew his righteous demeanor had dampened her spirits. It seemed that unless he gave her some "benefits," she wouldn't reveal any "shortcuts."

In the past, he, Huang Zhen, would never have had to resort to this! But the rules in the髡's territory were different from those of the Great Ming. His usual methods were useless. He had to take this last resort! After all, the great cause was paramount. He quickly smiled again.

"Sister-in-law You is right, but as you know, those of us who can treat patients and prescribe medicine are not young anymore. It's too much to ask them to take these exams. If you have any shortcuts, sister-in-law, please point them out. I would be most grateful..." As he spoke, he shifted his body slightly towards the Director. Still smiling, he said, "Come, let me toast you, Sister-in-law You." He stood up, filled the teacup in front of her, and raised it.

You Xiu's smile grew sweeter. "A toast from Shopkeeper Huang, I must drink it." She took the cup and, in the process, grasped Huang Zhen's hand.

"Shopkeeper Huang is indeed a strong man. Even your calluses are so firm."

Huang Zhen naturally couldn't pull his hand away. He could only reply, "A life of labor. A humble background. I'm making a fool of myself in front of you, Sister-in-law You."

"Don't call me sister-in-law, it's too formal—besides, my late husband's surname wasn't You."

"Yes, yes." Huang Zhen steeled himself and changed his address. "Please look after me, Sister You."

"Ah, that's more like it." You Xiu took a sip of tea with a smile. "Since you, Shopkeeper Huang, have shown me such favor and called me Sister You, I must look after my brother." With that, she took a book from the shelf next to her desk.

The covers of these books were the same as the syllabus he had bought: white paper with red characters. Huang Zhen had excellent eyesight. He saw that the bookshelf was filled with various "regulations"—"Compilations of Policies and Regulations and Their Instructions for Use."

She opened it to a page and smiled. "Shopkeeper Huang, you are too impatient. For the traditional Chinese physician's license, let alone people like you who have just come over from the darkness of the Ming to the light, even the naturalized citizens with B-level literacy certificates have to study in a training class for half a year to a year to pass. The traditional Chinese pharmacist license is easier. As long as you are a fully apprenticed pharmacy assistant, you can pass with some extra reading."

Huang Zhen knew this was the preamble and that something important would follow. He adopted an expression of rapt attention.

The Director continued, "I heard you say that your doctor specializes in bone-setting?"

"Yes, this Doctor Jiao is a famous bone-setter in the north..."

"You see, in this case, you can have him apply for a 'Specialty Traditional Chinese Physician' license, not a regular one. This is also stipulated in the regulations."

The so-called "Specialty Traditional Chinese Physician" was actually a special channel opened by the Ministry of Health for certain unique talents in traditional Chinese medicine. The world of traditional Chinese medicine had a number of "one-trick pony" physicians who either mastered a unique treatment technique, such as acupuncture, trauma care, massage, or bone-setting, or were particularly good at treating certain difficult and miscellaneous diseases, such as skin diseases, snakebites, or venereal diseases.

These specialties were considered relatively niche in the world of traditional Chinese medicine. The social status of itinerant doctors was already low, and the status of these "side-door" practitioners was even lower. Some, like snake doctors, were even considered beggars.

They often came from a long line of family tradition, with fathers teaching sons and masters teaching disciples. They possessed a unique skill and a few proven formulas to make a living. Their level of education was often not high, and they had little to no knowledge of traditional Chinese medical theory, relying entirely on empiricism.

It was impossible for these people to pass the traditional Chinese physician's license exam. But to prohibit them from practicing medicine would be a great waste of talent. At Liu San's suggestion, a special channel was created: no theoretical exam, but a direct, on-site assessment at the hospital. Those who passed would be issued a "specialty license." Naturally, they were not allowed to practice in any field other than their own specialty.

For someone like Jiao Gongli, this was all he needed to do. Of course, his pharmacy could only offer bone-setting services.

So there was a trick to it! Huang Zhen thought to himself. No wonder everyone said "officials are as slippery as oil." Without this conversation, how would he have known about this loophole?

With this, the heart that had been hanging in suspense finally settled. Jiao Gongli might not be good at studying, but his skills were readily available. He couldn't help but thank her profusely.

"What are you thanking me for? It's all thanks to the Senate's good policies." You Xiu stroked Huang Zhen's hand. "I see Shopkeeper Huang's hands have strong joints. You must be very powerful. Why not learn the art of 'daoyin' and 'tuina' massage? You could get a license for that too." As she spoke, she raised an eyebrow, her eyes dancing. Huang Zhen felt You Xiu's thigh pressing against his knee. Although it was warm and soft, the usually upright Huang Zhen felt a little uncomfortable.

However, this Director You was so familiar with the髡's situation. To lie low and establish himself here, he would need her help. But getting this close was not a solution... Huang Zhen's mind raced. A plan formed. While talking, he reached his hand under the table and gave You Xiu's thigh a hard pinch.

"Ai! Yo..." You Xiu cried out in pain, but she immediately suppressed her voice. The "yo" trailed off, the sound fading away, quite pleasant to the ear.

"You devil! You're so rough!" You Xiu chided in a low voice, one hand rubbing her leg, but her eyes were like silk, full of charm.

Huang Zhen whispered, "I thought you'd like it, sister. To be honest, sister, this is what I'm into..." He then gave her thigh several more pinches. He intended to scare her off, so he used a lot of force.

You Xiu moaned softly, "Aiyo, aiyo," panting, her eyes looking as if they were about to drip with water. "Harder... harder, your servant, your servant just likes it rough..."

Huang Zhen cursed inwardly. His pinches had probably left bruises on her thigh. He hadn't expected Director You to have such a heavy taste; his actions had only fanned her flames.

Even worse, "Sister You's" thigh was warm and elastic. Even through several layers of clothing, the sensation was quite good. After a few pinches, he himself began to have a physiological reaction.

Seeing You Xiu's dazed eyes, her body pressing against his, one hand leading his towards her chest, Huang Zhen knew things were getting out of hand. If he didn't pull back now, he didn't know what would happen. He quickly said, "Sister You! This is your office!"

You Xiu, who had been burning with desire, was doused with a bucket of cold water. Her head cleared. People were coming and going outside the office; someone could walk in at any moment. If they were seen, it would be a huge scandal!

Thinking of her loss of composure, You Xiu's face turned beet red. She couldn't say a word, just hung her head.

Huang Zhen thought to himself, "That was close!" He quickly stood up. "Sister You, I'll take my leave..." He left without waiting for her reply.

Back on the street, he felt a wave of relief. He cursed the degenerate atmosphere of the髡's territory. No wonder the "fake髡" women liked to wear such shameless clothes!

But for some reason, a sliver of regret lingered in Huang Zhen's heart. This You Xiu was truly a "youwu" (a stunner)...

Although it felt a bit like he had sacrificed his dignity, his relationship with the Director had progressed. This would be beneficial for his future activities and for lying low in Nanbao. He just had to be careful to maintain a certain "degree."

Back at the shop, he told everyone the news about the "Specialty Traditional Chinese Physician" license. A collective sigh of relief filled the room, and the previously somber atmosphere dissipated. Jiao Gongli was, of course, relieved. Song Shengying, who had been ready to give up, was now also willing to give it a try—he had some skill in 'daoyin' and 'tuina' massage, and treating bruises and injuries.
