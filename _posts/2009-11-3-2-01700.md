"Xue, I have a very bad feeling..." Guo Yi told him everything he had discovered. "--I don't know how to explain all this. If they arranged it, their acting is Oscar-worthy."

"You're right. It doesn't make sense to do this just to kill us. If it's just an act to make us believe, the cost is too high."

The rain was pouring outside. The two of them were silent, watching the water droplets flow down the waterproof cloth and into the pile of rocks at their feet. They didn't know what to say. A sense of abandonment gripped them, as if they were the only ones left in the world. Too many inexplicable things had happened in the last 24 hours.

"It's not an act," said Salina, who had been sleeping. She had woken up and was sitting up, leaning against a rock.

"You should rest." Xue Ziliang immediately became a gentleman. "Your internal organs seem to have suffered a shock. Get more rest."

"It's okay..." Salina's Chinese was a bit awkward, but still fluent. "Guo, your suspicion is reasonable," she gasped for breath. "When you examined the body, did he have underwear?"

Guo Yi thought, *I'm not a pervert. Why would I strip a male corpse in broad daylight?*

"Guo, people in ancient times didn't wear underwear..." Salina seemed a little weak. "Especially the poor."

"Is that reliable?" Guo Yi was seriously skeptical. He recalled that he hadn't noticed any underwear when searching their belongings, but he didn't know if they had any.

"Assuming they are modern people in disguise, the planners couldn't have thought of the underwear issue." She paused for a moment and said to Xue Ziliang, "When the rain stops, let's go back and look at the body."

"No," Xue Ziliang said. "If the enemy returns, we don't have the strength to fight them again. I'll go and bring a body back."

"I'll go with you."

"No, you stay here and guard. Salina has no ability to resist right now." Xue Ziliang waved his hand. "I'll be right back." He put on his rain gear and went out.

For a moment, only Guo Yi and Salina were left in the cave. It was the first time Little Guo was so close to a foreign woman. A strong scent of perfume mixed with the smell of blood, and some other odor, a bit like the smell of a wild animal... The mixed scent made him feel uncomfortable all over. To be honest, up close, a Caucasian woman like Salina wasn't very good-looking. Her skin was rough and a little bumpy, but her full and curvy figure, watery blue eyes, and long black eyelashes... still made his heart pound. He wouldn't have dared to think about it in his original environment. As an ordinary, non-leading security officer, the sensitivity of his job prevented him from having much private contact with foreigners—unless it was a mission. The current isolated environment made his sense of organization and discipline begin to waver... He really wanted to strike up a conversation with Salina...

"Guo, can you help me get a backpack to lean on?" Salina spoke first. "I'm very tired."

"Oh," Little Guo was stunned for a moment. "Okay." He dragged a backpack over and helped her lean against it, taking the opportunity to touch her shoulder again—her shoulder was so round...

"Thank you," Salina closed her eyes. "Guo, you are a very reliable person..."

Guo Yi actually blushed. The word "reliable" was worth pondering now.

"If Ziliang hadn't saved me today, I would have been beaten to death." Guo Yi quickly displayed the traditional virtue of the Chinese nation and was modest.

"If Winnie hadn't saved you, we wouldn't have escaped either." Winnie was Xue Ziliang's English name. Salina gasped for breath again. "The current situation is not optimistic, not optimistic at all..."

As they were talking, Xue Ziliang came back with a body on his back and placed it on a rock. The rain had stopped. Salina managed to get out with the help of a stick, and they examined it together.

It was the body of a young man, shot to death. Seeing a person he had killed lying in front of him made Little Guo very uncomfortable. Death had distorted the man's face, but he could still see that he had the typical features of a southern Han Chinese. Xue Ziliang found a pack of latex gloves in his backpack and gave each of them a pair. Salina drew a dagger from her waist and used it as a dissection tool.

The deceased's hands were covered with calluses, his upper limbs were strong, and his muscles were firm, indicating that he had been engaged in manual labor for a long time. He was wearing straw sandals. After taking them off, they found thick calluses on the soles of his feet, caused by walking barefoot for a long time. There were many signs of parasite bites on his skin, and he had a scabies infection. Salina pried open the corpse's mouth and had Xue Ziliang shine a flashlight on it. His teeth were white, but severely worn, which was caused by long-term consumption of food mixed with impurities.

They cut open his clothes, and sure enough, there was no underwear. The fabric was a coarse cotton cloth, very roughly woven, and dyed a blackish-blue color. Xue Ziliang rubbed it for a while and said that it was probably dyed with a plant-based dye. The dyeing was uneven, and the color had faded severely. In any case, it couldn't have been a factory product.

After the examination, Xue Ziliang went to throw the body into the river. Salina took off her gloves, her face turning even paler.

"I'm starting to believe what they said—" she said. "The deceased doesn't look like a person living in modern society at all."

"Could it be some tribe in a primitive society?"

"If you say so, there are only a few primitive tribes in the mountainous areas of Southeast Asia, but the location and racial characteristics don't match," Salina said. "These tribes can't weave, let alone dye. If they can do these two things, they are not a primitive tribe."

"Is it really 1628 now?"

After a while of discussion, they still couldn't reach any conclusion. No one could believe the claim that they had arrived in ancient China. The only way was to keep moving forward until they reached a populated area, and then the truth would naturally be revealed.

The recent fierce battle made them not very optimistic about the safety of the road ahead. Guo Yi's Type 64 pistol was lost and he couldn't find it, and even if he did, he had no more bullets. The weapons of the two ATF agents were temporarily detained by customs when they entered the country. Now, apart from three military daggers, they had no weapons. Fortunately, the attackers only had clubs. If they had iron spears or more swords, it wouldn't have been so easy today.

Guo Yi sharpened the three wooden sticks, built a fire, and slowly dried and hardened the tips. He had learned this from "The History of the Revolutionary Struggle in the E-Yu-Wan Soviet Area." It was said that it would be even better if they were soaked in a manure pit for a few days.

Xue Ziliang took care of the patient, Salina, and slowed down his pace, which also gave the aching Little Guo a chance to catch his breath. The further they went, the louder the sound of the water became. The terrain here became steeper, and rocky slopes were often seen. The group walked and climbed, and after turning a slope, they saw a large stone beach in front of them. The river water cascaded down from nine levels of rocks, making a thunderous roar. The riverbed was littered with rocks, scattered in the water. In the river, there was a cluster of rocks more than ten meters in diameter, with cracked tops, shaped like petals, and pink in color. Some were like lotus flowers spreading on the water; some were like old men playing chess; some were like fishermen fishing, and some, due to the erosion of the water, had rocks in the potholes constantly rotating and colliding, making a clanging sound.

[Note: These scenes are excerpts from past articles describing Bairen Tan. Many of the historically famous rocks in modern Bairen Tan are gone.]

"The scenery is really nice..." The trio, who had just experienced a life-and-death struggle, were in a much better mood. As they were walking, they suddenly found four people with a lot of luggage standing on the stone beach ahead—it was the Ming family.

While they were resting on the road, this family, who had been behind, had overtaken them. Seeing them approach, the two women showed a vigilant and frightened expression. Little Guo thought it was probably because they had seen the bodies on the road.

The old man with the worst temper didn't even look at them. He squatted under a large rock on the beach, holding his head in his hands, as if deep in thought.

Guo Yi looked over. The rock was only engraved with three palm-sized characters: "Bairen Tan." What was there to study?

Seeing Xue Ziliang about to approach, the policewoman MM suddenly took a step back and assumed a defensive posture, which made Xue Ziliang confused.

The old lady held her daughter-in-law's hand, looked at the sharpened wooden sticks in their hands, and squeezed out a smile:

"It's nothing, it's nothing, it's good that you're acquaintances..."

Little Guo hurried up and told them everything that had happened along the way. When he mentioned being attacked by more than a dozen people, they clearly showed disbelief. It wasn't until he took out his ID that their doubts were slightly dispelled. The beautiful policewoman MM named Mu Min examined his ID for a long time before returning it to him.

"Don't mind it, there are too many fake police IDs nowadays." She sat down on a rock and pointed to the rock beside her. The gentleman standing there in a daze quickly sat down.

Damn, so obedient. Before Little Guo could despise her husband, Mu Min began to talk about some internal matters of the system. Both of them were in the same system. Although their business departments were different, they could still chat. After chatting, he found out that this MM was very strong. She had been in public security for 3 years, criminal investigation for 5 years, and the political department for 1 year. She was a capable person who could handle both civil and military affairs. As they chatted, Guo Yi found that the wariness in her eyes had disappeared a lot. He suddenly realized: this girl was checking his "background." Even if you could get a 100% realistic ID, you would never know the internal affairs of the system if you weren't in it.

Amazing! Guo Yi couldn't help but feel ashamed. The gap between people was so big.

After both sides had shown their cards, their vigilance was much lower. Li Mei—the old lady became more enthusiastic. Seeing that Salina was not well and had a slight fever, she found medicine from her luggage and offered a pile of miscellaneous things like preserved fruits, ham sausages, and biscuits. The trio of agents hadn't eaten anything since they set out in the morning and had exercised vigorously. Their stomachs were growling. While swallowing a ham sausage, Xue Ziliang whispered to Guo Yi that this thing definitely had excessive preservatives, and it was all oil and starch, which was extremely harmful to health...

"You're so picky! If you're afraid of dying, don't eat it." Guo Yi was extremely dissatisfied with this ABC, not because this bastard acted like America was the greatest all day long, but because he always rushed to help Salina, which made Little Guo's mentality subtly unbalanced.
