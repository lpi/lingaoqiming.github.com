The Executive Committee discussed the remaining two issues. Most felt that not harassing the common people was already their policy, so agreeing to it or not made little difference. The main point of contention was the second issue: whether to release the captives. Wu De and the construction team were firmly against it. The former had just finished training them and things were running smoothly, while the latter's workload was heavy, and losing the labor team would significantly impact efficiency.

Others were also reluctant to let these people go. In the end, it was decided to release only the small landlords and rich peasants. The transmigrators did not yet have enough to offer to attract their allegiance. The rest would be held for the time being to facilitate the rapid establishment of a native auxiliary force.

With this decision made, Wu De spent the night reviewing all the captives and compiled a list of about a dozen who could be released. They were all from wealthy households or rich peasant families. Keeping them was of little use, so it was better to release them for some tangible benefits.

They also discussed some other terms and settled on a set of conditions for the negotiation. The next day, Zhang Youfu came to visit again, bringing a simple gift of eight items. Ostensibly, it was to thank them for allowing the collection of the bodies, but in reality, it was to sound them out.

Xi Yazhou then presented their three demands:

1.  The transmigrators may trade freely with the local people at any location in the county. The government and others may not obstruct them.
2.  The transmigrators may freely hire labor within the county.
3.  The transmigrators shall have freedom of movement within the county.

At the same time, he stated that regardless of whether the county agreed to these three conditions, as a gesture of goodwill, they would release some of the captives. He also presented a list of those to be released and asked them to see if there were any additions. If they wanted to take the people immediately, they could be released right away. If there were no special requests, they could bring sedans and livestock to pick them up the next day.

Zhang Youfu naturally did not dare to make a decision on this matter. He copied the list of those to be released and the conditions and took them with him.

When Wu Mingjin received these conditions, he was also undecided. Some things were easy to agree to, but others were of great importance, especially the trade of goods. He had a vague feeling that this was similar to the conditions the red-haired foreigners had demanded a few years ago when they sent ships to request the opening of a port for trade. Could these people be of the same ilk? He hurried to consult with Secretary Wang.

Secretary Wang pondered for a moment, drank a pot of strong tea, and then made up his mind. He whispered, "Your Excellency, just agree to it."

Wu Mingjin shook his head. "I have two concerns. First, if they follow the old tricks of the Portuguese, refuse to leave, and use Bairen as their city and Bopu as their port, this place will become a second Macau. The court will never allow it. Second, although they say labor is freely hired, if they sail away in the future, won't we be guilty of separating families?"

Secretary Wang smiled. "Your Excellency is overthinking it. The most important thing now is to appease the gentry and collect the autumn grain. After half a year or a year, you can lobby for a transfer at the provincial level. Whether this place becomes another Macau will have nothing to do with you. As for separating families—hiring labor is a matter of mutual consent. If people choose to work for these uncivilized folk and are taken overseas, it is their own fault."

Wu Mingjin thought it over and decided that this was the only way. He summoned Zhang Youfu and told him to agree to the 'Kun' bandits' terms, but not to leave any written evidence. Zhang Youfu understood. He then went to gather the heads of the families waiting to ransom their people and told them to prepare a thank-you gift.

The families with captured members had been as anxious as ants on a hot pan, begging for help from all quarters, trying to find someone to negotiate with the pirates. They were willing to pay silver for the ransom, even to the point of bankruptcy, just to save their loved ones. But this group of pirates was of unknown origin, and they couldn't establish contact. Now, hearing that the other side was not demanding a ransom and would release the captives the next day, being asked to contribute even one extra tael of silver felt like having a layer of skin peeled off. It pained them to the core. They all competed to cry poverty, each claiming to have grown up in unbearable bitterness. Even after talking late into the night, they still couldn't reach an agreement. Zhang Youfu was furious. He had to put his foot down, threatening that if they couldn't agree on a suitable amount, he wouldn't go to Bairen Beach to pick up the people the next day. "Whoever wants to pick them up tomorrow can go themselves!" he said, pretending to storm off.

The crowd wouldn't let him go and blocked his way. The county magistrate's assistant, Wu Ya, also chimed in with some placating words. One played the good cop, the other the bad cop. After much persuasion, they finally decided to offer six hundred taels of silver, one hundred bolts of Qiong cloth (a local cotton fabric from Hainan), four pigs, and one ox. Another thirty taels of silver were set aside as a reward for Zhang Youfu. The silver and cloth were to be divided among the families according to the size of their property. Everyone was satisfied with this total amount, as a ransom would have cost at least three or four times as much. After agreeing on the amount, they worried whether it would satisfy Chieftain Xi. They decided to ask Zhang Youfu to go the next day and present the offer. If Xi Yazhou agreed, they would then send the silver and cloth to pick up the people.

The next day, Zhang Youfu went to see Xi Yazhou with sedans and livestock. He pleaded the case of the wealthy families, describing their hardships, and then stated the amount of silver and cloth. Not only did Xi Yazhou not show any sign of finding the amount too small, but he also expressed his gratitude. Without waiting for the county to deliver the silver and cloth, he immediately released the small landlords and rich peasants.

This gesture further increased the gentry's goodwill towards them. Even the common people, hearing of their actions, felt that these pirates were benevolent. They had also heard that they never burned, killed, or plundered. The bolder ones began to leave the city and return home—there was much work to be done in the fields. Within a few days, the refugees in the county town had all dispersed. The south gate of the county town, which had previously been open for only two or three *shichen* (4-6 hours), was now open along with the other two gates. The tense atmosphere that had lasted for more than a month slowly dissipated. A few days later, pedestrians, who had been absent from the roads, gradually reappeared. Farmers were also seen working in the fields near Bairen Beach.

"Peace is truly wonderful," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, intoxicated, as he stood on the watchtower.

"Peace is temporary," Bei Wei said grimly from behind him. His proposed hunting plan had been adjusted twice and was ready to go, but it had been put on hold because of the peace talks. These days, he had been training Ye Mengyan and the other young men who had been clamoring to be special forces soldiers with the intensity of "metal, wood, water, fire, earth, sun, and gold." The screams of the dozen or so men could be heard from the training ground every day.

Xue Ziliang of the ATF also had a painful awakening during his time driving a bulldozer about how to change his fate. He noticed Bei Wei's training course and would sneak over to the training ground every day after work. At first, Bei Wei was reluctant to pay him any mind, but after Xue Ziliang offered a few very professional opinions during the training course, the two began to exchange ideas frequently. Xue Ziliang took the opportunity to show off his skills in front of Bei Wei. A few beautiful tactical movements and excellent marksmanship made the former reconnaissance company commander look at him with new eyes. It was then that he revealed his trump card: before joining the ATF, he had served in the US Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance (FORCE RECON) and had participated in the Iraq War.

"You see, I'm a veteran too," Xue Ziliang said, looking at Bei Wei with eyes full of loneliness. And so, the souls of the two former reconnaissance soldiers, one Chinese and one American, resonated and struck a spark of camaraderie. Their expressions were so full of masculine fortitude and tenderness that a legend of Brokeback Mountain began to circulate among the special forces trainees that day.

After that, the two exchanged ideas on the training ground even more frequently. There was much to talk about between colleagues, especially those who respected each other. Although the military group had many specialties, including people from armored and naval backgrounds, he was the only one specializing in reconnaissance. Usually, besides being able to talk shop with former infantry commanders like He Ming and Xi Yazhou, there was not much else to discuss. Now, with someone like Xue Ziliang, they had many common topics. Their discussions, ranging from special forces operations and tactics to various military issues, became increasingly in-depth. Of course, the rumors about the two of them also spread like wildfire.

Bei Wei himself was completely unaware. When He Ming, in the capacity of an old comrade, tactfully suggested to him that as a main leading cadre of the military group, he should pay attention to the influence of his private life, he still found it difficult to understand. How could a person who never paid any attention to women have rumors about his lifestyle? Speaking of which, he couldn't stand how friendly Xi Yazhou was with the women!

It was only when the rumor finally reached his ears that he suddenly realized that private life problems were not limited to relationships between men and women. After his face turned from red to green and then to white, he ran out. Xi Yazhou quickly led people to follow him, afraid that he would do something stupid in a moment of impulse. After an investigation, Bei Wei announced to the special forces training team that each member would have to do an extra 200 push-ups after the day's training until the rumors about him and Xue Ziliang disappeared.

However, this did not affect his friendship with Xue Ziliang. Xue Weini, with the keen insight into human relationships that was innate to him as a Chinese person, had found his way to survive in this once unfamiliar environment.

For most of the transmigrators, the biggest change brought about by the détente with the locals was at the dinner table. When [Wu Nanhai][y009] swaggeringly wrote the three characters for "braised pork in soy sauce" on the "Today's Specials" blackboard in the cafeteria, the newly built counter was almost crushed by the crowd.
