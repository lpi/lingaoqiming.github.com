Liu San met Dong Weiwei and gave her the medicine. He had made some of the simplest remedies: ready-made formulas using locally available herbs that could be prepared. For ease of use, they were all made into powders and pills.

"These are some simple herbal remedies I made," Liu San handed Dong Weiwei many paper packages and wooden boxes from his basket. "You know a little about traditional Chinese medicine, right?"

"A little," Dong Weiwei said, a bit embarrassed. "Actually, I only learned a little about acupuncture, cupping, and massage because I needed it for fitness."

"Can you take a pulse?"

"Only a little."

Liu San said, "In that case, you should first read this 'Barefoot Doctor's Handbook.' It has diagnostic and treatment methods for many simple diseases. Observation, listening, questioning, and palpation—you don't have to rely on pulse diagnosis to make a decision. Common diseases are more common in the countryside. This is the 'Diagnosis and Treatment of Common Diseases in Hainan' compiled by Minister Shi. You should study it too."

"Alright, mastering some medical skills is too useful for carrying out our work."

"This is the medical alcohol, absorbent cotton, and cotton swabs you requested..." Liu San took out a list. "This is a list of the medicines I've prepared and their applicable symptoms." He said, "There are pest control and prevention medicines, diaphoretics, dampness-dispelling medicines, purgatives, fire-clearing medicines, and sedatives... But the Chinese medicinal herbs here are really incomplete, and some can't be prepared. Some formulas have easily available ingredients, so I'll just give you the formulas."

Finally, Liu San took out a small wooden box. "This is a gift from the Ministry of Health—a medicine box." He winked. "There are also some trial products inside."

Dong Weiwei curiously opened it. Besides the usual things, there was also a rough-looking homemade gauze mask—a new product. There was also a box containing a brand-new set of simple surgical instruments.

"This is too important. Isn't it a waste to give it to a layman like me..." Dong Weiwei certainly knew that surgical instruments were valuable.

"It's alright, this is made in Lin'gao!" Liu San was satisfied with her reaction. "Take it out and have a look."

"Is this copper?" Dong Weiwei asked in surprise.

"That's right, it's bronze," Liu San said. "To be honest, I didn't expect the medical equipment factory to be able to make this. I heard that Jiang Ye from the machinery factory and a few jewelers recruited from Guangzhou made it together."

"That's amazing!" Dong Weiwei's eyes lit up. Looking at the things on the table, she said, "The Ministry of Health is really amazing! This is a great help."

"I'll be conducting disease control research in this area for the next few days. I can also teach you some simple medical skills along the way." Liu San had studied pharmacology, but he had already received crash training in simple surgery at the hospital.

So Liu San began to practice medicine in the Thirteen Villages area. He not only practiced medicine in the church but also constantly went on house calls with Dong Weiwei during her village inspection tours. This caused their reputation in the area to soar. Liu San was very meticulous during his rounds, recording everything he saw and heard every day—he was also responsible for conducting basic health surveys here.

During his rounds, Liu San deeply understood what it meant to be "lacking doctors and medicine." The people here knew that there was a profession in the world called "doctor" who treated people's illnesses, but few had ever been treated by a doctor. They rarely even saw itinerant doctors who rang bells and carried medicine chests. Once they got sick, they just waited to recover on their own. Sometimes they would use some folk remedies of unknown effectiveness. All kinds of infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and parasitic diseases were rampant; the infant and maternal mortality rates were very high, and women's diseases were very common. Dong Weiwei was also a woman and was particularly sympathetic to this. She had proposed several times to strengthen the number of professional nurses here.

Liu San, however, was not very concerned about this. Bairen didn't have enough medical staff for its own use, and there was a shortage of medicine. How could they send people here? Besides, practicing medicine was not his main job. He paid more attention to collecting various folk remedies during his rounds. Regardless of whether they were useful or not, whenever he encountered a folk remedy, he would carefully copy it down and then determine what the ingredients were. He wouldn't let go of even the most absurd folk remedy. He did manage to collect quite a few formulas.

One day, he was holding a clinic in the ancestral hall and had seen many patients. For some, he had medicine to give, so he gave them a few doses. For others, he had nothing, so he could only give them a dose of licorice—purely a placebo. Fortunately, the common people were grateful to have a doctor at all, and he didn't charge a penny, so they didn't complain much. After a busy morning, he was just taking out a rice ball to eat when someone suddenly shouted from outside, "Make way, make way, is the doctor here?"

Hearing the voice, Liu San knew that a critical patient must have arrived. He quickly shouted, "Here, come in quickly!"

A few men came in from outside, carrying a patient.

"Put him on the board, let me have a look," he instructed, walking over.

The patient was a boy of eleven or twelve. The muscles of his face were constantly convulsing, and his jaw was clenched, giving him a "sardonic smile." His throat was spasming, and his breathing was difficult and rapid. Liu San was shocked—these were typical symptoms of tetanus.

"Is there an external wound?"

The man who had carried him in quickly pointed to his foot, which was wrapped in a dirty rag. Liu San tore it off, revealing a deep wound. He asked the person accompanying him and learned that he had been stabbed by a rake tine. This made it even more certain.

"This is tetanus!" Liu San's expression was grave. Looking at the patient's condition, the toxins had already begun to take effect. Once tetanus took effect, it was quite dangerous even in a modern hospital, let alone with him being empty-handed. He didn't even have hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound, let alone tetanus antitoxin.

"Doctor, please have a look at my child," the middle-aged man who had carried him in pleaded. Then, a few old and young women knelt before him—probably his family—all crying.

"Don't worry," Liu San calmed himself down, his mind racing through the traditional Chinese medicine treatment formulas. He immediately wrote out a prescription. "Go and get the medicine right away! There should still be time!"

The person who took the prescription looked helpless. Liu San had been here for a long time and knew that the people here were extremely poor. Getting medicine was simply out of the question for many. He quickly took out his private seal and stamped it on the prescription.

"Go to the herbal medicine shop in the county town and give them this prescription!" The shopkeeper of this medicine shop was very familiar with Liu San because they had had a lot of contact. It was no problem to ask them to sell a few doses of medicine on credit.

The middle-aged man was about to kowtow, but Liu San instructed, "Go quickly! It'll be too late if you're late!" Then he shouted to the people crowded around, "Get out, get out, what are you all crowding around for?" Tetanus patients needed quiet and to be protected from stimulation. He thought for a moment. The best thing to do now was to disinfect the wound. Without hydrogen peroxide, he had to use potassium permanganate—this was quite precious now, and there wasn't much in the medicine box. Just as he was thinking, Dong Weiwei came in.

"Doctor Liu, let's go eat. I made fried rice noodles today—" She was startled when she saw the convulsing child lying on the door panel.

"Tetanus!" Liu San explained. "You have to help me."

"Alright, alright." Dong Weiwei quickly put on the blue cloth gown on the wall. She didn't have a white coat, but since Liu San had arrived, she had followed his advice and wore a gown, mask, and hat whenever she saw patients.

"Let's move him to a quiet place first. The patient can't be stimulated." The doors and windows here were all open for convenience, and the light was very bright.

"Let's move him to the east wing of the church. No one lives there," Dong Weiwei immediately found two soldiers to help carry the person to the east wing. Liu San then asked someone to paste more paper on the windows to make the room as dim as possible.

"Prepare a 1:1000 potassium permanganate solution! Quickly!" Liu San observed the wound, which was covered in a lot of dirt. Iron, rake, and farmland—it would be a wonder if he didn't get tetanus with these three elements combined.

Dong Weiwei fumbled to take out the bottle of potassium permanganate from the medicine box, then found an enamel basin and clean water. Suddenly she asked, "Oh no! There's no measuring cup or scale!"

"Put one tablet in first, then slowly add water. Pay attention to the color of the solution!" Liu San said. "Light red is about right. Purple is too concentrated."

After preparing the solution, he first debrided the wound and then repeatedly rinsed it with the potassium permanganate solution. The child on the door panel convulsed from time to time, and Dong Weiwei quickly came to help hold him down.

"It's alright. Look at his tongue coating. Is it yellow and rough?"

Dong Weiwei used a tongue depressor and with great difficulty pried open his clenched teeth.

"No!"

"What about his temperature? Does he have a fever?"

"He has a fever," Dong Weiwei touched his forehead. "Should I use a thermometer?"

"How's his sweating?"

"He's sweating, but not profusely."

Liu San looked at his complexion again. It hadn't turned a terrifying bluish-purple, which meant that the disease had not yet entered the second stage—in traditional Chinese medicine, it was called "wind toxin entering the interior." The chances of success with traditional Chinese medicine treatment were still relatively high, and he relaxed a little.

"No need," he said. "The child is in the stage that traditional Chinese medicine calls 'wind toxin in the exterior,' which is the initial stage. Take his pulse. What kind of pulse is it?"

Dong Weiwei knew that he was taking this opportunity to teach her Chinese medical diagnosis. She took his pulse with her fingers for a while and said hesitantly, "I'm not very good at this, but it feels like a wiry and rapid pulse."

"This means his condition is still very serious." It all depended on the speed of getting the medicine. Liu San said, "If they hurry, they can probably make a round trip in half a day. This child will most likely survive."

Dong Weiwei looked at the child, who was thin and small, dressed in rags. A wave of pity washed over her. "Actually, doesn't the Bairen General Hospital have antitoxin? We could just get some and give him a shot."

"Hehe," Liu San laughed strangely. "There's only so much tetanus antitoxin, and a lot has been used since D-Day. We have to save it for our own people."

"One shot wouldn't matter, would it?" Dong Weiwei certainly knew how precious the antitoxin was.

"One shot of antitoxin can also save a life. Whose life do you think we should save?"

Dong Weiwei was speechless. The question was too cruel and too realistic.

"That's why I'm seizing every opportunity to try traditional Chinese medicine therapies," Liu San said after rinsing the wound. He didn't cover or suture it, just left it open. "The antitoxin will run out one day, and then we'll have to rely entirely on herbal medicine."

Then, under his guidance, Dong Weiwei performed acupuncture on the patient to suppress the convulsions.

Late at night, the medicine was finally brought back. Liu San personally ground the medicine into a fine powder, sifted it, mixed it, and then fed it to the patient with hot wine. Then he applied the medicinal powder to the wound.

"This is a modified version of a traditional formula called 'Yuzhen San'," Liu San gave the formula to Dong Weiwei. "You can study it. Tetanus is a disease you'll encounter often here. It'll be easier to deal with once you've mastered this."

After several days of taking and applying the medicine, the patient's condition had greatly improved. The convulsions and stiffness had disappeared. Liu San was greatly encouraged—in the past, he only knew that tetanus could also be treated with traditional Chinese medicine, but he had never seen a case in person. This case gave him a huge boost of confidence. At least one disease that threatened the future health of the transmigrator group had a corresponding treatment method. He quickly organized the entire treatment process, including the pulse records, formulas, medications, and various treatment methods and measures used. This could then serve as a standard case model to teach future doctors.

Seeing the child getting better day by day, Liu San felt a special affection for him because he had saved his life. He often went to the ward to see him and talk to him. In order to facilitate his activities of collecting herbs and treating diseases in the county, Liu San had learned a little of the Lin'gao dialect, so communication was not too difficult.

Through their chats, he learned that the child's surname was Fu—Liu San knew that "Fu" was a common surname in Lin'gao, and many people, rich or poor, had this surname. As for his given name, he didn't have one, not even a nickname like "Dog's Leftover" or "Stone." He was the fourth in line, so he was called Fu Sinan.

Although Fu Sinan was said to be the fourth in line, he was actually the second oldest in the family. He was eleven or twelve years old this year. Two of his three older brothers had already died before the age of fifteen. He now had three living siblings. Fu Sinan's family was as poor as a church mouse, like most people here. They lived in a house with bamboo walls and a thatched roof, and for half the year, they ate sweet potatoes and taro—and often didn't have enough to eat. In short, he was a standard specimen of a peasant in the wretched old society.

After talking with him for a few days, Liu San discovered that the child had a great talent for gardening—he was in charge of the family's vegetable garden. He also had a personality that was rare here, a willingness to communicate with people. In Liu San's experience, the common people of this time were generally taciturn. They would either answer a question with a single word or simply roll their eyes and say nothing.

Having such a child who was good at expressing himself and communicating made Liu San feel much better. He thought of the Executive Committee's call for everyone to "take on apprentices," and his gardening skills would be of great help to his own medicine cultivation. Liu San asked:

"Can you read?"

"No," Fu Sinan shook his head.

"Do you want to learn to read?"

"I don't have money to learn..."

"Well, how about you become my apprentice? You can be a doctor in the future too."
