His gaze fell on the innkeeper's face, and he smiled. "Innkeeper, you have a way with words. Your inn is truly the finest in Lingao."

The innkeeper chuckled. "You flatter me, sir. May I ask for your esteemed name?"

"My surname is Zhuo, and my given name is Yifan."

"It is an honor. Please, follow me, Master Zhuo. You can just call me Li Xiaoliu."

"Not at all, thank you for your trouble," Zhuo Yifan said politely.

As they were speaking, the rest of the people from the carriages had disembarked. There were several women among them, dressed in fine clothes, surrounded by a retinue of maids and servants, with male servants and guards in attendance—the very picture of a wealthy and powerful family.

The innkeeper knew that such families disliked having their womenfolk stared at—for this reason, General Manager Li had even hired female attendants—so he didn't even turn his head in their direction, instead focusing on welcoming Zhuo Yifan and his party.

Just as they reached the entrance, a sharp cry came from within. A figure was thrown out of the door, landing with a loud "thump" on the ground. He rolled a few times before coming to a stop.

It was a large man dressed in black, now covered in dust, groaning and struggling to get up.

A shadow flashed in the doorway. A curvaceous and beautiful woman in her prime appeared. She had picturesque features, cherry-red lips, and a head of short, black hair. She wore a black police uniform with a diagonal leather belt that cinched her slender waist.

The policewoman strode out, raised an eyebrow, and pointed. "Do you think this is the Great Ming? Still trying to throw your weight around like a dog? Let me tell you, I'm in a good mood today. Otherwise, just for that grab, I'd charge you with assaulting an officer and put a bullet through your skull!"

The man on the ground struggled to get up, his face a mask of defiance.

The woman snorted. "I came to register your master's household as a favor to General Manager Li. Since you dared to be insolent, spout nonsense, and try to take advantage of a public servant of the Senate, don't blame me for doing things by the book. Tell your master to bring his entire family to the police station tomorrow to register. I don't care if it's his first wife, his concubine, his unmarried daughter, or his newlywed daughter-in-law. They'll all stand on the street and wait to be called! Don't blame me if you miss the deadline—you earned this for your master."

The burly man's eyes rolled back, and he didn't dare say another word.

The policewoman dusted off her hands. Several servants and the inn's manager rushed out. A man who looked like a steward had already come out, holding a red envelope, which he quickly tried to stuff into the policewoman's hand, smiling obsequiously. "Officer, please calm down. He was blind and foolish to have offended you..."

But the policewoman was not swayed. She tossed the red envelope aside and walked away with a sneer. Even the manager, who had intended to mediate, didn't dare to approach her.

The steward, his face flushed with anger, picked up the red envelope and stomped his feet, cursing the unfortunate man. The burly man, his face pale, said nothing and followed the steward back inside, scurrying away like a rat.

The crowd of people on the street pointed and whispered among themselves. Zhuo Yifan was also quite surprised. He had never seen such a simple and quick fighting style. It was not flashy, but very practical.

Zhuo Yifan whispered to the innkeeper, "Who is she?"

"She's a police officer from the East Gate Market police station, in charge of security in this area."

"A police officer? A public servant?"

"Yes, that's what they're called here. They handle hotel registration, household registration, and issuing identification cards."

"In that case, how could that man be so bold? As the saying goes, a strong dragon doesn't mess with the local snake, especially not a public servant!"

"You're right, sir. But where else do you see women as public servants? That man is a newcomer and didn't know the situation. He's a servant of Master Guo, who arrived yesterday. He knows a few clumsy moves. Master Guo's third concubine often has him as an escort. Old Master Guo used to be an official in the capital. A single word from his family and any local official would give him face. He's used to being arrogant. He also had a few drinks earlier. The alcohol went to his head, and he caused trouble for his master."

Although the innkeeper lowered his voice, there was a hint of schadenfreude in his tone. It seemed this family was not well-liked here.

"This policewoman's skills are truly impressive..."

"You carry a sword, sir. I imagine you are also a martial artist."

"A zither, a sword, and a box of books are the essentials of a scholar. I can brandish it a little for exercise, but I wouldn't call it martial arts."

The innkeeper chuckled and led him inside.

The Qiong'an Inn's service to these "gods of wealth" from across the sea was meticulous. They had offices in several ports with regular shipping lines, such as Haikou and Bopu, complete with lounges and carriage fleets. After disembarking, the wealthy families could rest for a while before taking a carriage to East Gate Market.

Because the women of wealthy families were generally unwilling to show their faces in public, it was difficult to get them to immediately adapt to Lingao's "queuing and numbering" system. Li Xiaopeng had specially asked his grandfather to speak with Chief Xiong, and they were eventually granted the "privilege" of having the police come to their door to register their households.

Even the design of the main gate was unique. Upon entering, one was greeted by a screen wall. Walking around it led to the front courtyard, which, in addition to the reception desk, had three entrances. The left and right entrances led to long alleys, with courtyards of various sizes scattered on either side. The central entrance also led to an alley that went straight to the back courtyard, where the kitchen, stables, and storage for large luggage were located. To provide a place for the ladies to relax, a private garden had been built next to the inn.

The attendants led the group into the left alley. The high brick walls on either side of the long alley created a cool and shaded path. Narrow flower stands were built along the base of the walls, adorned with green potted plants, adding a touch of life.

The alley was lined with black-lacquered courtyard doors, each with a plaque. The attendant led Zhuo Yifan to one of the doors, took out a key, and opened it—it wasn't a padlock, but a lock built into the door, which was quite novel.

The inn had prepared a large and a small courtyard for them. The smaller one was for the masters, and the larger one for the servants. Although the courtyards had the layout of a traditional siheyuan, the structure was completely different. Firstly, they used more multi-story buildings to increase the effective floor area. Secondly, they fully considered the traditional housing allocation of large families, taking into account the separation of men and women, relatives and strangers, and masters and servants. No other inn or hotel in Lingao could offer this. Naturally, not many people could afford it, but the guests who stayed here, from a few days to over half a year, ensured that there was no shortage of business.

Zhuo Yifan and the steward took a quick look and were very satisfied. The rooms were clean, and the furnishings were elegant. As for the legendary "Australian comforts," there was no need to even mention them.

They settled in. Zhuo Yifan, in his role as the "young master," was responsible for overseeing everything. When wealthy families traveled long distances, they brought not only their own bedding, but also their own spittoons, tea cups, and candlesticks—partly because they found outside items to be unclean and unsatisfactory, and partly because they feared the inn would not be fully equipped. So, in addition to their luggage, they brought many miscellaneous items.

After assigning everyone their places, Zhuo Yifan returned to the main room. A fruit platter was already laid out on the table. Six large white porcelain plates were filled with sliced fruits of various kinds. Although it was only late spring, there was already excellent watermelon. There were also many other fruits he didn't recognize, red, green, yellow... a colorful and appetizing display that made one's mouth water just by looking at and smelling them.

There were also two large glass jars, one filled with sour plum soup, exuding the fragrance of osmanthus, and the other with a red liquid that had a sour and refreshing aroma.

The maids quickly took out the masters' tea cups, rinsed them with hot tea, and then used new bamboo ladles to pour a cup of a refreshing drink for each of them to quench their thirst. They also soaked new towels, provided by Li Xiaoliu, in freshly delivered cool water, wrung them out, and presented them for wiping away sweat.

Li Xiaoliu was running around, busy attending to them, showing the servants how to use the various facilities in the courtyard. Finally, he came to the main room, stood at the door without entering, and asked, "Sir, should your large luggage be stored in the back courtyard, or brought here?"

"Bring it all into the courtyard."

"Yes, sir!" Li Xiaoliu then asked, "Master Zhuo, could you please come to the front desk to sign the guest register?"

Zhuo Yifan followed Li Xiaoliu to the reception desk. As the young master, he didn't need to write himself; an accountant was there to do it for him. But with over twenty people in their party, it took a long time to report everyone's name, identity, and place of origin. When the registration was complete, Li Xiaoliu said with a smile, "The police will come tomorrow to register your households. It will inevitably disturb you all. This is official business, so please be patient. This place is not like the Great Ming, the Australians..."

"I understand. Don't worry."

"Yes, it is very considerate of you, sir." Li Xiaoliu then asked if they had any large sums of money or valuables. They could be temporarily stored at the front desk, or they could have someone from Delong Bank come over immediately to handle savings and exchange services.

"The silver has already been sent through Delong. We don't have any valuable items. We only have silver, and not many circulation coupons..."

"No problem, our inn can also handle that." Li Xiaoliu pointed to the wall behind the counter, where a plaque showed the day's exchange rates for gold and silver, including various purities of silver, gold, and even copper coins.

Zhuo Yifan nodded noncommittally. In his position, he naturally wouldn't handle the exchange himself. After completing the procedures, Li Xiaoliu presented him with a "Guest Room Facilities User Manual"—since the inn opened, there had been many incidents of equipment failure due to improper use.

Zhuo Yifan took out a tip and rewarded the attendant before heading back to his courtyard. As he passed by the gate of another courtyard, he heard someone begging for mercy in a loud voice:

"Third Mistress, have mercy! I'll never do it again. Ouch..."

Listening closely, he recognized the sound of a wealthy family administering punishment. Amidst the crack of the paddle, a woman's sharp voice could be heard scolding, "Beat him hard! Break his dog legs!"

Zhuo Yifan sneered and went on his way.
