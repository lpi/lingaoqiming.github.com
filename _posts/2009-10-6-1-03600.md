After a brief exchange of pleasantries, [Xiao Zishan][y001] departed, returning to the outpost to find Master Sun of the Qiwei Escort Agency awaiting him. Before [Xiao Zishan][y001] could express his gratitude, the old master was already bowing, his face wreathed in a congratulatory smile. [Xiao Zishan][y001] presented him with a hundred taels of silver as a reward.

"Your masters are truly men of letters and of war," Master Sun beamed, his delight palpable as he accepted the silver. "Such skill, and such formidable firearms! My men returned with tales of a rescue so clean, so decisive, they had never witnessed its like."

"We are strangers in this land," [Xiao Zishan][y001] replied graciously. "Without the aid of your esteemed agency, we would still be stumbling in the dark."

"Not at all. Qiwei merely lent what little aid we could." Master Sun passed the silver to a young apprentice. "But I have a word of counsel, if Shopkeeper Xiao would indulge me."

"Please, speak freely."

"The rescue was a success, but the bandits have seen the layout of this place. You must be wary of retaliation. A man can be a thief for a day, but one cannot guard against a thief for a thousand. You have many valuable goods here; you cannot afford to be careless."

[Xiao Zishan][y001], still smarting from his encounter with the cunning Gao Ju, found himself wary of the old master's equally foxy smile. He held his tongue.

Seeing his hesitation, Master Sun came to the point. The Qiwei Escort Agency, he explained, was prepared to offer their services as night watchmen. It was, besides guarding shops, their primary business within the city. He also offered to train some of their servants as personal bodyguards.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] considered the offer. Night security was a risk. The residence held too many secrets, and the men of the escort agency were sharp-eyed and shrewd. The Executive Committee, however, had decided to cultivate a relationship with the agency. Gao Ju was their only significant local contact, a dangerously narrow channel. An escort agency, by its very nature, moved through all strata of society, from the highest officials to the lowest criminals. They were a potential key to the city's intricate social machinery.

The men of the escort trade, he knew, were a different breed. They valued trust and righteousness. To win them over, one could not simply buy their loyalty. It had to be earned, through the intricate web of relationships and obligations that governed this society.

Following the plan discussed with the Committee, [Xiao Zishan][y001] began. "Sun Chang," he said, "rendered us a great service. We have decided to grant him his freedom."

"A magnificent gesture!" Master Sun stood and bowed deeply. For a servant, freedom could be a perilous thing, but Sun Chang was his nephew, and his servitude a source of shame.

"He earned it himself," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, with a pointed glance at Gao Xian, who was serving tea nearby. "When a master is in peril, those who stand firm deserve to be rewarded." He continued, "Though he is free, Sun Chang is a loyal and trustworthy man. If he is willing, we would like to keep him in our service."

The old master's face flushed with excitement. To remain in the service of the Australians offered his nephew a future far brighter than that of a common escort. "Of course, of course! Any matter entrusted to you is a matter for Qiwei. We will do our utmost."

*As I thought,* [Xiao Zishan][y001] mused. *Family is a powerful motivator.*

He dismissed Gao Xian and turned to his next point. "There is also the matter of Gao Di. He is clever and quick-witted, and he gathers information for us in the city. But he is young, and the streets are a dangerous place for a boy with no martial skill. We would like to entrust his training to your agency. You are men of honor; we know you will guide him well."

Master Sun beamed, his pride evident. The Australians, it seemed, held his agency in high regard. Seeing the time was right, [Xiao Zishan][y001] concluded the meeting.

That evening, he returned through the wormhole to report to the Executive Committee. The question of extending credit to Gao Ju sparked a heated debate. It was Yu E'shui who offered a new perspective.

"What is the date in Guangzhou?" he asked.

"April 30th."

"The 30th of April, in the seventh year of the Tianqi reign," Yu E'shui mused. "In eighteen days, Emperor Xizong will go boating in the West Garden. His boat will capsize. He will be rescued, but his health will decline from that day forward."

"He doesn't die until August," someone interjected. "You think we can convince Gao Ju to stall the construction of a shrine for Wei Zhongxian until then?"

"You underestimate the political instincts of a bureaucrat," Yu E'shui countered. "Wei Zhongxian's power is entirely dependent on the Emperor's favor. Tianqi's health is already poor. Once he falls ill after the boating accident, his death is only a matter of time. His only heir is his brother, the Prince of Xin. The moment the Emperor's health fails, the court will be in turmoil. No one will be eager to take a stand in such an uncertain climate.

"This Eunuch Yang is not a core member of Wei Zhongxian's faction. He is merely trying to curry favor. When the political winds shift, he will be the first to abandon this project. To build the shrine would be to tie his fate to a falling star."

"But they don't know that Chongzhen will succeed Tianqi."

"Tianqi has no surviving sons. His only heir is his brother. The officials are all keenly aware of this. Once the Emperor falls ill, Wei Zhongxian, the darling of the court, will become a risky investment. The Prince of Xin, the rising star, will be the one to watch. Who would be foolish enough to invest in a stock that is about to be delisted?"

"So I should tell Gao Ju to delay past May 18th?"

"The news will take at least ten days to travel from Beijing. Tell him to delay until the end of May, and the problem will solve itself."

"I propose," Yu E'shui said, a smile playing on his lips, "that we offer a small demonstration of our… predictive abilities. We will tell him that on May 18th, there will be a great change in the court. To predict the future, especially a major political shift, is a powerful lure. Once our prediction is verified, it will greatly enhance the mystique that surrounds us, the sense that we act in accordance with the Mandate of Heaven."

The idea was met with a wave of enthusiasm. Some even suggested that Yu E'shui himself should play the role of the prophet. Others, more ambitious, proposed a mission to Beijing to curry favor with the future Chongzhen Emperor, to reform the Ming dynasty from within…

Yu E'shui was appalled. Did they think the Eastern Depot and the Embroidered Uniform Guard were staffed by fools? To spread such "rumors" about the Emperor's health would be to invite a swift and brutal end in the imperial prisons. The Prince of Xin himself was in seclusion, avoiding all contact. He would not be meeting with any "prophets."

Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed. The fantastical proposal was voted down. Yu E'shui then offered some practical advice. "Do not be too explicit," he warned. "Fear is an unpredictable thing. Simply say that on May 18th, a great change will occur. And do not claim the knowledge as your own. Attribute it to some vague and mysterious source, an observation of the celestial phenomena, perhaps.

"And remember," he concluded, his voice grave, "do not, under any circumstances, predict the fall of Wei Zhongxian or the death of the Emperor. Gao Ju will undoubtedly report such words to Eunuch Yang. They would not hesitate to arrest you, if not to gain merit, then to save their own skins."
