The visit to the church had another effect: it reassured him. He had always suspected that the Australians worshipped the devil and drew extraordinary power from him. Now, seeing such a magnificent church, the cross, and the priest, his doubts vanished. He now believed that this was extraordinary wisdom and power granted by God. Finally, he could leave Lingao with a peaceful heart.

It was a calm and leisurely day. The Bairen Industrial Zone continued to spew smoke of various colors, and a steady stream of wastewater flowed from the treatment plant's outlet into the Wenlan River. The temperature was gradually rising, and the river water seemed greener than in previous years, with a faint odor. Some of the diversion channels even stank and had to be cleaned daily.

In a more remote district of Dongmen Market—yes, Dongmen Market now had districts, not just a single street—transverse streets branched off from Central Avenue as it extended, one after another. New districts were formed, the land enclosed by fences and marked with signs bearing strange characters. In some places, new houses were already under construction; others lay vacant, allowing the common people to plant vegetables.

At the entrance of Fifth Street, colloquially known as Wudaokou, stood a newly completed tea house. The ground floor sold tea, while the second and third floors were tea rooms. This was a new venture of the cooperative. As a mass consumer good, tea consumption in Lingao was growing. Lingao itself did not produce tea; it was all imported from Fujian. The cooperative opened this tea house not only to regulate people's livelihood but also to withdraw currency from circulation.

The Executive Committee and the Standing Committee had already agreed to appropriately introduce private capital into many non-critical industries. This tea house had capital invested by several clients of the Tiandihui, accounting for 49% of the total capital. These clients were now, under guidance, planting tea, a cash crop, in the hilly areas to meet domestic demand.

The guest rooms on the second and third floors, with their clean and elegant furnishings, also attracted many tea drinkers. The clientele mostly consisted of newly rich local small landlords, merchants, and the ever-expanding ranks of native employees from various departments.

The most frequent customers of the Wudaokou Tea House were the council members from the finance and banking systems. This place was very close to the newly opened head office of Delong Bank. Many of them often came here to chat and relax. Gradually, it replaced the cold, square, and utilitarian lounge in the old Finance and Economics Committee compound in Bairen City, which was filled with the simple lines and intensive feel of primary industry.

The tea was imported from Fujian and then simply sorted, reprocessed, and packaged by machine at the Ministry of Light Industry's tea factory. Most of the famous Fujian teas of this era could be found here. The most popular was oolong tea, which had already appeared at that time.

This was a small epitome of the intersection between the diligent, simple, and pioneering merchants of the Celestial Empire and the new power of Lingao. Fujian tea, Lingao-style packaging and service, and the cooperation between native merchants and the monopolistic state-owned enterprise. It all operated very naturally and smoothly. After the Wudaokou Tea House opened, it gradually became a gathering place for the council members of the finance and banking circle. Even the native nouveaux riches who came here to drink tea knew that the third floor was not for them.

The council members' leisure life was generally not very interesting, and the people in the finance and banking departments faced reports and numbers every day. To adapt to a future financial system without computers, the departments under the General Finance Directorate were promoting "manual accounting." This backward move was to prevent a day when, without computers, everyone would lose the ability to even compile reports. The current computer system was only used for some more complex calculations.

The daily routine of looking at reports, using the abacus, hand-cranked calculators, and slide rules made everyone complain incessantly. Not to mention that everyone was assigned apprentices, who, rather than helping, actually increased the workload, making everyone's burden even heavier for a time.

The more tedious the work, the more they valued leisure and relaxation. This place became a daily must-visit for many, not only for idle chatter but sometimes even for work meetings.

Over time, these gatherings led to the formation of several small groups among the finance and banking council members. The main ones were the "Accounting Faction," the "Banking Faction," and the "Finance and Taxation Faction." The boundaries between these groups were not clear-cut, and there was much overlap in personnel. These small factions loosely united to form what was later called the "Wudaokou" faction in the Yuanlaoyuan. This system did not have the scale of the Law Club, nor the meticulous thinking and organization of the law professionals. There was no ambitious Ma Yuan leading everything here—the small factions within the group were numerous, and they held each other's financial, economic, and fiscal philosophies in contempt, with no one buying into another's ideas. Therefore, in the Second Plenary Session, the financial group failed to usurp a larger piece of the power cake. Naturally, it did not achieve the same level of success as the Law Club.

In the primary coal-iron complex, the finance, or rather the current finance and economics department, was an indispensable but not the most important department. So everyone was well aware of the limited possibilities for gaining more power.

"We are a service unit." On this issue, the finance and economics department was very unified in its thinking.

The finance and taxation system had just undergone a comprehensive restructuring after the recent Second Plenary Session. The original Finance and Economics Committee was split and reorganized into multiple departments. The new system finally had a formal Ministry of Finance. The nondescript audit department, the Cheka, finally gained official status. The tax department, which had long lacked a clear status, was also established. Besides officially taking over the County Grain Collection Bureau, a compromise product of the old Ming system, a new tax bureau was also being formed.

The original Delong Grain Store was divided into two departments. One retained the old name—Delong Grain Store—and continued to handle grain procurement, storage, and sales. The currency issuance and financial business parts of Delong were spun off to become Delong Bank, which currently played a three-in-one role as a central bank, a specialized bank, and a commercial bank.

The new Minister of Finance, Cheng Dong, never came to Wudaokou, but he was very supportive of his subordinates discussing professional issues here. The tea house was an informal setting, and conversations were more relaxed, unlike formal meetings where discussions were so formal that many things could be put on the table. So this place gradually became an important venue for business departments to discuss and formulate policies.

The third floor was all private rooms, with fine bamboo curtains hanging at the doorways and some green plants for decoration. Some rooms were very small, accommodating only four or five people for a chat, while others were large enough for twenty-odd people to hold a meeting. A native attendant stood guard at the top of the stairs to prevent any uninformed native from wandering onto the third floor, and also to look after the thermoses and tea.

It was working hours now, and most of the private rooms were empty. Only one was full, with seven or eight people sitting around a round table, joking with each other. The main topics of conversation were the business issues of their system and the soon-to-be-available female servant welfare. From time to time, some "you-know-what" laughter could be heard.

There was hot tea and platters of fruit on the table. The skylight in the roof was open, and the smoke from several cigarettes and cigars rose slowly towards it. This scene of curling smoke earned them the elegant nickname "The Immortals' Meeting" from the natives.

"I hear the quality of the female servants is very good after training, much better than when they first arrived," Yi Fan, the head of the Cheka, said with a hint of dissatisfaction, feeling a bit unrestrained. "I really want to get one back soon to train her myself."

The Cheka had been established for several months, but so far, they hadn't caught any "big fish." Yi Fan was very disappointed. His audit work was progressing at a snail's pace because he didn't have the right people. Everything had to be started from scratch. And there were so many people competing for resources. For example, the basic accounting training class for auditing was only started on a large scale under his strong advocacy. As a result, most of the trained accountants were intercepted by various departments, and the Executive Committee seemed to have suddenly realized—to have various departments and enterprises keep accounts and improve the financial system, you needed accountants.

So Yi Fan ended up with less than ten people. Adding the apprentices he personally trained and the clerical staff who didn't need to know accounting and auditing, he had barely scraped together a football team's worth of people.

These ten or so people learned on the job. Yi Fan spent more than ten times the effort he would have spent doing it himself—these fledgling auditors made countless mistakes, and he had to personally review every single document. As a result, he still hadn't figured out the accounts of the various enterprises under Wu Nanhai's Agricultural Committee. His famous quote, "drag the council members out and shoot them," had become a joke.

Ji An ate a mango. "The good-looking ones have to be won through a lottery and bidding. They're deliberately trying to drain our assets."

"I don't care at all," Wu Di flicked his cigarette ash. A complete ash flew out beautifully and landed in a glass full of cigarette butts. This man was in his early thirties, with a medium, well-proportioned, and muscular build, and was quite handsome, attracting a lot of attention in a crowd.

"What's so great about native female servants? They're not that good-looking, and they're short," Wu Di said with contempt. "Never mind their looks, they have absolutely no common language with modern people when they open their mouths. I'm not interested at all."

"Then why are you collecting the female servant welfare fund?"

"Everyone else has it, why shouldn't I?" Wu Di said nonchalantly. "Besides, it's not bad to buy one to do housework. This kind of 'life secretary' is only good for that."

Few of the transmigrators had brought their wives or girlfriends. But this Wu Di had not only brought his young and beautiful wife but had also managed to bring along his sister-in-law. This fellow made no secret of his ambiguous relationship with his sister-in-law, and the three of them were often seen together, drawing stares from everyone. Du Wen had privately repeatedly cited his wife and sister-in-law as typical examples of "automatically putting on the shackles of patriarchy and becoming male appendages."

"You're a classic case of a full man not knowing a hungry man's hunger—" Every time Yi Fan saw him, he really wanted to check his accounts to see if he could find a reason to have him shot, to prevent him from monopolizing so many resources. But Wu Di's current position at the Delong Bank's credit department had so far done very few transactions. So he had to dismiss the idea.

"Ahem." Jin Zhijiao coughed beside them. As the only woman present, she was very uncomfortable with this topic and also felt a personal sense of unease—"Old Hu isn't going to get a concubine, is he?"

Yi Fan noticed her reaction and quickly changed the subject. It wasn't that he respected women, but because Jin Zhijiao was currently one of his top generals and he had to keep her on his good side.

Jin Zhijiao was the wife of an engineer at Lingao Telecom, Hu Muye. She had graduated with a degree in accounting and was very good at statistics. She was now the second-in-command at the Cheka.

"Any new policies recently?" Yi Fan asked casually, flicking his cigarette ash.

Chen Ce, the director of Delong Bank's planning department, glanced at him and stubbed out his cigarette.

"Are you pretending you don't know, or do you really not know? The Executive Committee's General Office issued a document on monetary system reform, asking us to supplement the previous report with a detailed plan."

"The one for soliciting opinions?" Yi Fan said. "Isn't that the report you submitted last time?"

A few months ago, Chen Ce had submitted a report to the first Executive Committee on the reform of the finance and economics system. In this report, besides demanding a reform of the Finance and Economics Committee system and the separation of finance and economics, he had also raised the issue of monetary reform.

"That's right, it's generally the framework I proposed. But you can see that the Executive Committee has no idea how to reform the monetary system; they are wavering badly."

"It's not bad. At least the current reform of the finance and economics system is greatly related to your report. Delong has been split up—tell me, was the ultimate goal of your report to split up Delong?"

In the era of Delong Grain Store, the people in power were mainly from the Planning Committee system. The finance and accounting personnel were basically the ones doing the work below.

After the split, the grain business was spun off, and the banking system was established. The group of people who had been working in finance and accounting immediately rose in status. A number of them got middle-management positions.

"Hehe, you can't say that. It's the general trend!" Chen Ce said calmly. "A grain store doing finance, that's ridiculous. It's not right. Can you imagine the Ministry of Food of the People's Republic of China issuing banknotes?"

The so-called base currency is a liability of the central bank. The central bank buys treasury bonds to issue currency. So the first step of Chen Ce's proposed finance and economics reform was to turn Delong Grain Store into Delong Bank. This step had now been achieved. That's why he proposed monetary reform.

"Didn't the Ministry of Food of the People's Republic of China issue grain coupons for many years? But we're more thorough, a direct two-in-one," Yi Fan commented.

"You also studied finance and economics. You must be the clearest about the problems with our so-called 'circulation vouchers'."

"That's right. That's why I agreed when you proposed that Cheng Dong use grain as the standard." Yi Fan said. In the early stages of establishment, it was feasible to use fully convertible paper currency with rice as the general equivalent. In an underdeveloped place like Lingao, only rice could provide sufficient and reputable credit guarantee, and through foreign trade, the price of rice, and thus the value of the currency, could be stabilized within an acceptable range of fluctuation.

"The biggest problem with the grain circulation voucher is that it is actually a grain store exchange voucher. It's too restrictive. Other assets have to be converted into rice first before they can be converted into currency. This is no longer compatible with the current social and economic development," Yi Fan summarized. "However, the key to its passage at the time was that you played to the liking of Ma Dugong, that 'industrialism' fanatic." Yi Fan laughed. "I have a feeling that Dugong's understanding of currency is fundamentally insufficient, but he has a strong hostility towards finance and a desire to completely control the financial system."

"Dugong is a fanatic for planned economy," Wu Di said, lighting a new cigarette. "He also has a new monetary system plan."

"Oh, I'd like to see that. I didn't know Ma Dugong was also interested in finance and economics."

"It's very long," Wu Di said. "I can summarize his ideas for you."

"I'm all ears."

"Ma Dugong's monetary system, in short, is to control the world's currency issuance by controlling trade channels," Wu Di said. "His theory is that by monopolizing the logistics industry, you can monopolize the right to define currency. The British pound and the US dollar were able to become international currencies because they monopolized the circulation of goods."

He took out a notebook from his pocket. "Let me read you a passage from his original text—

...There are two prerequisites for buying things: A, someone is selling, and B, there is a channel to buy it. With only farmers, you can't buy rice. With only factories, you can't buy clothes. You must use currency, and the logistics industry must act as an intermediary. Therefore, by monopolizing the logistics industry, you can monopolize the right to define currency. The British pound and the US dollar becoming international currencies in modern times was most crucially because these two countries controlled the seas. Controlling the seas has two meanings. One is that you have a monopolistic merchant fleet that others cannot compete with. So you conduct all the major trade, and you naturally have the right to choose how to price it. The other is that you have the world's number one navy and can stop any trade route at any time without fear of retaliation. The United States and the United Kingdom are such models. The United States doesn't care who extracts the oil in the Middle East or who manufactures half the world's industrial goods—as long as these things are priced in US dollars..."

"Of course, if we can achieve that, it will be beneficial in the short term, as we can see from the old world's United States," Chen Ce said. "His plan is the same as the Americans', relying on the credit of an international currency to issue unlimited debt. Most of the over-issued currency circulates in the world market."

"In this plan, he has a four-step proposal," Wu Di said. "First stage, make this new currency—let's call it the Australian dollar—able to buy our goods. We have circulation vouchers now, so we just replace them. Second stage, we demand that the Australian dollar can buy others' goods and be exchanged for gold and silver. Third stage, demand that gold and silver must be priced in Australian dollars. Fourth stage, we demand that everything be priced in transmigrator currency."

"Dugong is a believer in the omnipotence of planning and the primacy of materials. To him, finance is essentially heresy," Chen Ce said with a smile.
