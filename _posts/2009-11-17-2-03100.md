The so-called distinction between the three people obviously meant that he was different from the two foreigners from the ATF—in the future, their treatment and development would differ based on this distinction. As for whether it was good or bad, it was hard to say.

On the bright side, he was Chinese, and the other two were Americans. Considering that "those who are not of my race must have a different heart," he was clearly a "target that can be united with." But from the perspective of some Chinese people who have always liked to give preferential treatment to foreign masters, it was not certain that these two rootless foreign friends would be more valued by this group of leaders, and he would instead become a detestable person who tried to sabotage their plans—if so, his best outcome would be "controlled use."

This gave him a lot of trouble. He knew very well that the ideas of leaders were often different from others, and this strange mode of thinking was associated with the position rather than the individual—once a person became a leader, the way he thought and his logic would be different from others, and it was difficult for others to guess his true intentions. In his opinion, the leaders of this time-space adventure group would be no exception.

Since he was assigned to the basic labor group, he had been working in obscurity. He naturally understood the profound truth that ordinary Chinese people understand, "to live with one's tail between one's legs," but he was also waiting for an opportunity at all times, waiting for an opportunity for the Executive Committee to recognize him as a revolutionary comrade.

He did not expect this opportunity to come so soon.

While the transmigrators were engrossed in the enthusiastic construction of this new city, no one realized that this huge construction site was not fully fortified. After landing, the local people fled at the sight of them, and the victories in several small-scale conflicts made the transmigrators complacent. The shipload of arms and ammunition from the North American branch also inflated their sense of security to the extreme—they thought that trenches, abatis, barbed wire, SKS rifles, and searchlights could form the most solid fortress.

The spies in the county town were peeking from a distance every day, carefully not daring to get too close. The companions who were captured by the pirates riding roaring monsters had taught them enough lessons. The bravest people used trees and grass during the day to slowly get closer, and could more or less see what the pirates were busy doing. The city basically understood the pirates' every move, but they were helpless. There were not many people to discuss with, but what they said was all armchair strategy. The gentry were not active, so what could they use to fight? He knew the thoughts of this group of old moneybags: at worst, they would hide in the villages outside the city in a critical moment. "In a small chaos, avoid the city; in a great chaos, avoid the countryside." This was an old saying that had been tried and tested for thousands of years. As the county magistrate, if the city fell, there was no reason for him to escape with his life. He would inevitably have to die with the city—he was very unwilling to do this—if it weren't for his strong desire to become an official, he wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to be a county magistrate in such a poor and remote place.

The city was not peaceful either. There were more than two thousand villagers who had fled to the county town, and there were not enough houses in the city to live in. The farmers from the four townships either hid in the city, or those who did not enter the city did not dare to transport grain, rice, and vegetables into the city, for fear of being robbed by the pirates on the way. All kinds of food were scarce. The refugees lived on the charity of the porridge sheds. Malnutrition, coupled with sleeping in the open, had already caused some of the elderly and children to die due to their weak bodies. Every day, there were people crying in the streets, which made Magistrate Wu feel uneasy. He was deeply afraid that once there was any trouble, a civil unrest would be terrible. For this reason, he personally led people to patrol the streets every day to appease the people.

Just in case, he had already sent his trusted family members with able-bodied men to secretly send his family and valuable savings to the prefectural city, with instructions to immediately send them across the sea back to their hometown if anything went wrong. In this way, he became a complete "naked official."

The city spent more than ten days in fear, but the pirates still did not come to attack. The spies came back and reported that the cut-hair bandits had stopped after building the road to Bairen Tan, and were now engaged in large-scale construction there, seemingly with no intention of attacking the city. Wu Mingjin couldn't figure out what was so special about Bairen Tan that was worth them digging around—he had never heard of any ancient tombs or treasures buried there.

"This is really a headache." Wu Mingjin patted his head. In the past ten days, it seemed that his hair had turned a lot grayer.

"My lord, Inspector Fu requests an audience." The long-serving attendant came in to report.

"Let him in." Wu Mingjin said irritably. Although he knew that Fu Baiwen's twelve men could not have stopped the cut-hair bandits from landing, he still held a grudge against this person for fleeing at the sight of the enemy and not fighting hard. Now he could only be perfunctory with him. After all, he was the only military officer in the county, and he still had to rely on him. Fu Baiwen probably also knew that his crime was serious, and he was very diligent in both preparing for war in the city and scouting outside the city.

"Your Honor, the cut-hair bandits are building a city on Bairen Tan!"

Wu Mingjin's hand trembled, and the tea spilled. He hurriedly asked, "How do you know?"

"Yesterday I went to investigate in person. The cut-hair bandits have already built many houses on Bairen Tan!"

Wu Mingjin's teacup almost fell to the ground—this was what he was most worried about. If the pirates stayed, what would he do? In the past, he had always hoped that the pirates would leave after a few days. Now, not only did they not leave, they were also building roads, and now they were building a stockade less than ten li from the county town.

Once the stockade was built, the pirates would be entrenched for a long time. Not to mention, it was already September, and it was time to collect the autumn grain. The banks of the Wenlan River were the county's grain and rice producing areas. With the pirates right in front of them, how would the common people dare to go to the fields to harvest the grain!

If the autumn grain could not be collected... Magistrate Wu knew that this was much more serious than having pirates in the territory. Not to mention, his official career would definitely be over.

"Quickly, invite Mr. Liu." Wu Mingjin turned around and ordered, "Invite all the gentry in the city! And Old Master Huang from Huang Family Village."

The officials and gentry in the city heard the news from the spies at the meeting. Among them, there were quite a few who had read military books. Seeing this group of cut-hair bandits lined up along the main road, they thought that the pirates did not know military affairs and had set up a long snake formation that could not support its head and tail. They had not built a stockade with deep trenches and high ramparts like the one at Bopu. There were only two or three bandits with matchlocks at each location, and they were all short-clothed, cut-hair laborers.

This made the officials and gentry much more courageous. Fu Baiwen, because he had lost his defensive position as the inspector of Bopu, was the most active in advocating for an attack on the pirates in order to redeem himself. Magistrate Wu specially pointed out that the autumn harvest was approaching, and the farmers in the villages along the river did not dare to go to the fields. If there was a delay, the harvest for the whole year would be gone. Not only would he be failing the court, but the common people below would probably have no means of livelihood, let alone pay rent... The gentry's minds gradually became active. Someone immediately expressed their willingness to contribute men and money to fight the war and drive away the pirates.

On the eleventh day of the ninth month, the militia leaders of all the villages with local braves were ordered to enter the city for a meeting. Magistrate Wu's wording this time was extremely severe. In addition, several powerful gentry and large households in the county had clearly stated their willingness to fight to the death. The small stockades also had to agree to participate, either by contributing three or five men, or by providing swords, spears, and gunpowder. By the thirteenth, nearly three hundred local braves had arrived in the county town. Magistrate Wu still felt that it was not enough and sent people to Xinhua Township and Lipan Du in the south of the county to recruit thirty Li native soldiers from the Li villages. These native soldiers were all crossbowmen, equipped with poisoned arrows.

Jinshi Liu suggested a night attack, and Magistrate Wu also agreed very much. But Inspector Fu and Huang Shoutong both objected. They had some practical combat experience and knew that it was difficult to control the advance and retreat of the troops even for the best-trained official army at night, let alone a motley crew like them that had been hastily assembled. Since it was a motley crew, the only way was to rely on their numerical superiority, attack one point of the pirates fiercely, use the many to bully the few, wipe out a group of men, and destroy some of the pirates' vehicles and equipment.

Fu Baiwen ordered everyone to prepare more kindling and gunpowder to be used for setting fires during the battle. He had originally planned to bring the Franc-gun from the garrison, but Centurion Sun stubbornly refused, claiming that the cannon and soldiers were there to defend the city, and that fighting outside the city was the county's business, and he had no control over it. Magistrate Wu personally went to persuade him, but was also rejected. He was very disappointed in his heart. The messenger who went to Tang Yunwen in Baisha also came back. Tang Yunwen said that he had to participate in the battle to encircle and suppress Liu Laoxiang recently and had no time to come and expel this "small group of sea pirates."

However, Tang Yunwen's answer was also within his expectations. If the bandits did not break through Lingao City, the official army would not come to suppress the bandits. Now, he could only brace himself and fight with all his might.

On the one hand, the county gathered all the things in the armory to equip these poorly clothed local braves. On the other hand, they ordered the blacksmiths in the city to forge many new iron spearheads, collected all kinds of scrap copper and iron to make cannonballs, and recruited people to build war chariots... For a time, the city was in a state of chaos and noise.

All these movements in the city were reported to the Executive Committee by the observation post under the city without a single detail missing. Whether Lingao County was further strengthening its defense or preparing for a counterattack, no one could make a judgment. Finally, the order to strengthen the alert was issued, but the military group actually had no more strength.

Including the armed militia mobilized after landing, the military group had a total of only more than seventy people. Among them, three people sent to the surveillance point outside the county town and two people escorting the long-range reconnaissance and exploration team were deducted. The remaining people were responsible for the security tasks from the Bopu camp, along the road guard posts, all the way to the Bairen Tan construction site itself. The military group had already canceled the three-shift duty system and adopted a two-shift system to barely maintain a certain scale of security.

Whether such a defensive line full of loopholes was effective in front of the Ming Dynasty's local braves and militia could only be answered by actual combat. This was not a game, there was no LOAD available. Every person who died, every piece of equipment lost, meant an irretrievable loss.

All kinds of news from the observation post indicated that Daming Lingao County was about to launch a full-scale offensive against them. This was beyond the expectation of the Executive Committee. They had originally thought that the county would not attack without the reinforcement of the Ming army. But on the thirteenth day of the ninth lunar month, the observation post found that someone was dismantling the Tiger Respect Cannon on the city tower. This move further confirmed the military group's speculation. He Ming warned the Executive Committee that their current security situation was not optimistic. The Executive Committee decided in an emergency meeting to fully mobilize. Except for a few projects that would continue, all others would be suspended. SKS rifles would be distributed to all males, and revolvers to all females. The military group would be responsible for conducting several live-fire shooting trainings as soon as possible.

He Ming knew that most people had limited training. During the preparation phase of the transmigration, due to limited conditions, the so-called military training was mainly marching and physical training. There were not many live-fire shooting sessions. A rookie who was not familiar with shooting was no different from holding a fire stick with an SKS, let alone expecting them to fight actively and effectively.

After a meeting and discussion, the military group decided to continue to use the mobile defense plan. Once attacked, the mobilized soldiers would retreat to important strongholds. The soldiers of the military group would use agricultural vehicles and jeeps for maneuver. Wherever the enemy concentrated their greatest attack force, the agricultural vehicle mobile unit would attack them from the side and rear unexpectedly. He Ming believed that his side's strong communication and mobility would effectively compensate for the lack of troops.
