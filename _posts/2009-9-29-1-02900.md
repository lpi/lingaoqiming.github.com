"My head is so dizzy..." [Xiao Zishan][y001] woke from his dream, feeling groggy and extremely uncomfortable. He had been sleeping very well for the past few days. Not only was the air in Ming Dynasty Guangzhou fresh, but there was also no roar of cars early in the morning. His sleep had been exceptionally sweet.

In the early days of the transmigration trade, everyone dared not spend the night in the Ming Dynasty time-space. They would inevitably leave before nightfall, preferring to come back the next day. Now, as their business and connections became more and more consolidated, the things they had to do in the Ming Dynasty time-space also increased day by day. In order to extend the life of the wormhole, it had become commonplace to stay for a few days after crossing over. What's more, these past few days they could live a decadent life of having food served to them and clothes put on for them, and they were beginning to feel a bit like they didn't want to go back.

But today, his head was very heavy. He forced his eyes open. Outside the gauze window, the sky was bright after the rain. It looked like it was almost ten o'clock. He couldn't help but feel strange. There was no TV or internet in this time and space. Even when everyone discussed matters and chatted together, they all went to bed very early, so they would wake up by seven in the morning at the latest. Why was it so late today?

He sat up and glanced around the room, and was greatly shocked. The room was in a mess, a complete shambles. Almost all the drawers and cabinets had been opened, and things were thrown all over the floor.

We've been robbed!

This thought immediately flashed through his mind, and he couldn't help but feel anxious. The money and goods from this trade were still piled up in the room! If... he simply dared not imagine it. He quickly got up to get dressed—and suddenly found that his socks and sneakers were gone! They had really been robbed! There were a few pairs of straw sandals in the room. He quickly put them on and came out with his clothes draped over him.

As soon as he went out, he saw Bei Wei rushing out of his room. [Xiao Zishan][y001] noticed that he was also wearing a pair of sandals. His combat boots were also gone!

"Something has happened!" Bei Wei's words were concise and to the point.

"What happened?"

"[Chief Wen][y002] is missing!"

"What!" This scared [Xiao Zishan][y001] so much his hands and feet turned cold. [Chief Wen][y002] was missing! This was not 21st-century Guangzhou, where [Chief Wen][y002] could run out and know people everywhere, and there were the police of the safest city in the country—in 17th-century Guangzhou, they didn't know a single person outside the door. They didn't even know the way.

The two of them ran wildly, checking room by room. [Engineer Wang][y003] was still sound asleep. Then they went to the servants' quarters in the third courtyard. The Gao family and Sun Chang were also in a deep sleep. They quickly woke everyone up. They were all still dizzy and nauseous. The siblings Gao Lujie and Gao Di wouldn't wake up even when shouted at. Just as they were at a loss, Sun Chang suggested washing their faces with cold water.

"Master Xiao, this is not good," Sun Chang said as he watched the Gao family busily fetching water for everyone. Only then did everyone feel a little more awake.

"What?!"

"This is clearly a case of being hit with knockout incense."

"Knockout incense?" For some reason, the first name that came to [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s mind was Sun Erniang.

"It is knockout incense." Sun Chang had fled from his hometown during a famine and had begged his way to Guangzhou, so he had seen a lot of things in the jianghu. "Have the masters lost anything?"

This reminded them. The two of them ran at full speed to the west wing of the middle courtyard. Because this house was used as an important warehouse and crossing point, the Executive Committee had made some non-contemporary modifications here. Not only had they bricked up the windows and extra doors, but they had also used steel bars wrapped with barbed wire and a security door to create a small, four-sided fortified room inside. [Xiao Zishan][y001] saw that the padlock on the outer wooden door was gone and knew something was wrong. He quickly pushed the door open. The iron grate and the security door were both intact, and the full cart of goods was also neatly stacked. Only then did he breathe a sigh of relief.

It seemed the thieves had not succeeded. The security measures of the 21st century were still effective. The problem was that they had lost [Chief Wen][y002]! This was more terrible than losing the goods and gold and silver. Money could always be earned back, but for such a living person to be lost in the Ming Dynasty, it was hard to say.

"Who kidnapped [Chief Wen][y002]?" [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s mind was spinning like a windmill. Was this an accidental event or a premeditated one? It was hard to say. If it was premeditated, the only people who knew they were here were the Gao family. Besides them, they had no other contact with the entire city of Guangzhou. What was the point of the Gao family kidnapping [Chief Wen][y002]? If it was an accidental event, could it be that some great thief had entered the house to steal, and failing that, simply kidnapped [Chief Wen][y002] for ransom? That was also possible.

The three of them circled around [Chief Wen][y002]'s room for a long time, but couldn't see anything. [Chief Wen][y002]'s clothes, shoes, and hat were all gone, and even the anti-stab vest, pepper spray, and stun gun he always carried with him when he crossed over were also gone.

After looking for a long time, [Xiao Zishan][y001] couldn't help but say:

"Old Bei, have you seen anything? Aren't you a reconnaissance soldier?"

Bei Wei spread his hands: "I'm a reconnaissance soldier, not a criminal investigator. This needs someone from criminal investigation to look at."

"Let's find someone from criminal investigation to come over. Ran Yao used to be a policeman," [Xiao Zishan][y001] remembered.

"Then let's find him quickly, and also bring a few more of those mystery buffs who like to hang out in the reasoning section," [Engineer Wang][y003] said. Seeing that Gao Xian was about to come in to tidy up the room, he immediately shouted, "Don't move, preserve the scene!" which scared Gao Xian into running away.

After some discussion, it was decided that [Engineer Wang][y003] would first take the goods and money back through the wormhole to report the matter to the Executive Committee, and then summon a few professionals to come over and examine the traces. [Xiao Zishan][y001] and Bei Wei would continue to stay here to investigate.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] called over the Gao family and Sun Chang and questioned them about whether anything special had happened these days, including at the Gao residence. After a long time of questioning, he only learned from Sun Chang that a "Little Eunuch Yang" from Beijing was coming to visit Master Gao recently, and Master Gao seemed to have something on his mind.

When Gao Qing learned of this, he became even more gloomy and went to the front yard to sweep the floor by himself. It was Sun Chang who was much calmer. He came up and reported, "There is no need to be anxious about this matter for the time being. Since the thieves have kidnapped [Master Wen][y002], they will naturally send someone to deliver a letter. At that time, whether to report to the officials or to ransom him, the masters can decide then."

"Report to the officials?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] smiled bitterly. They were all "illegal immigrants." How could they provoke the officials of the Great Ming? Not to mention that he was well aware of the ancient mindset of public security. For cases that were not major crimes of robbery and murder in broad daylight, the officials couldn't be bothered. Unless a lot of money was used—in which case it would be better to just pay the ransom.

"Yes," Sun Chang said in a low voice. "It is not convenient for the masters to come forward as you are not people of the Great Ming. You can ask Master Gao to come forward, and have the officials handle it privately." He glanced at [Xiao Zishan][y001]. "Master Gao has influence in one prefecture and two counties."

"Hmm." [Xiao Zishan][y001] was noncommittal, but a doubt arose in his heart. Everything was normal before Sun Chang came. A few days after he came, [Chief Wen][y002] disappeared...

As he was pondering, Bei Wei walked in. Sun Chang quickly withdrew.

"I've found traces!"

"Oh? Where?" [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s spirits lifted.

"This group of people came over the wall from the small path behind the third courtyard. Many tiles were pulled off the eaves of the wall and fell all over the ground. There are also friction marks on the wall."

"Did they leave the same way?"

"Yes, they returned the same way. I checked other places, and there are no signs of climbing the wall."

"I remember Master Gao said that the small path behind here has wooden gates at every intersection that are locked. Ordinary people can't get in."

"I don't think they came in from there," Bei Wei said. "The front entrance is a main road, too conspicuous. If it were me, I would come over from the city wall."

"The city wall?"

"Yes. The backyards of the residences here are all against the city wall." Bei Wei nodded. "Although there are no ramps up or down, there are almost no people walking on the city wall at ordinary times. As long as you can get up, it's practically a highway surrounding the whole city."

"Right, right, that's very possible!"

"The day before yesterday, someone tried to sneak in to eavesdrop. I threw a stone out, and that person also fled towards the city wall. I think it's very likely the same group of people."

"It seems it was premeditated. But who would do such a thing?"

"That I don't know. In any case, we have to find [Chief Wen][y002] first. Let's wait for the professionals to take a look before we make a decision."

"Alright, we also have to notify Gao Ju and ask him to help find him. He is a local snake, after all, and knows a lot of people."

"Could it be related to Gao Ju?"

"The possibility is not high. What benefit would it be to him to kidnap [Chief Wen][y002]?"

"We can't be too careful. I'll go and look around again. What a pity about my dagger!" Bei Wei said resentfully. This dagger was bought at a high price from a knife and sword website—and now it had disappeared along with his Type 02 combat boots from 3515.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] repeatedly thought over the cause and effect of the matter in the study. No matter how he thought about it, Master Gao was the most suspicious. After all, only Master Gao knew they lived here. But what was the motive? [Xiao Zishan][y001] firmly believed that everything in this world had a motive. If Gao Ju did this, what did he want to get? If it was for money, he was already making a lot of money from the current trade. It obviously didn't make sense. Or perhaps he wanted to use [Chief Wen][y002] as a hostage to ensure the exclusive monopoly of all Australian goods in the future. That was possible. But there was no need to go to such great trouble, climbing walls and using knockout incense.

Climbing walls, knockout incense...

In the end, this was still the work of people from the jianghu!

[Xiao Zishan][y001] seemed to understand something. He called Sun Chang in.

"Are you familiar with the city foxes and den rats in Guangzhou?"

"Not familiar," Sun Chang reported. "I am not a local, nor am I from Guangdong. Furthermore, I have always worked in the Gao residence. The Gao family is extremely strict in investigating the background of their servants, and those involved with the three religions and nine schools of thought are not accepted."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] nodded. This self-declaration also largely dispelled his suspicion. Sun Chang hesitated for a moment, as if he had something more to say. [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, "If you have something to say, just say it. Here, I don't use people I suspect, and I don't suspect people I use."

"Yes!" Encouraged, Sun Chang opened his mouth, "I have an idea."

"Go on."

"In this Nanhai County, there is a Qiwei Escort Agency," Sun Chang said. "It's a small escort agency, and its escort routes are not long, but they have a specialty, which is 'sitting the shop.'"

"Sitting the shop?"

"Yes, master probably doesn't know. Shopkeepers are often harassed and extorted by street hooligans, so they hire escorts to sit in the shop to suppress them."

"So it's security," [Xiao Zishan][y001] understood.

Sun Chang didn't know what security was, so he just said "yes" and continued:

"The escorts who sit the shop are extremely familiar with the situation of the city's hooligans. If we ask them for help, we can definitely find out some news. If it's just the work of ordinary city foxes and den rats, we can also ask them to rescue the person."

Note: The business of "sitting the shop" for an escort agency only existed in Beijing during the Qing Dynasty. It has not been heard of in other places. Moreover, the escort agency industry is generally considered to have appeared during the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty. I believe that given the commodity economy of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, it is impossible that there was no similar industry or organization, but I could not find any information for a while, so I used the information from the Qing Dynasty.
