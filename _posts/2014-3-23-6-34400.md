A man's figure sat on the bed, silently watching the door. The small amount of light filtering through the bamboo curtains turned his entire person into a black silhouette.

He had no topknot, and his clothes had a collar—this was the typical appearance of a naturalized citizen. His build was not tall, but the bulging muscles on his arms and shoulders indicated that he was a strong and powerful man.

Xin Nachun placed the bundle she was carrying on the table and sat down carefully on the bed.

"What, the wound hasn't healed yet?"

The man's accent was strange; he spoke a rather non-standard Mandarin. He was from the mainland. Although he could speak a bit of official dialect, it was too difficult for Xin Nachun, who had grown up in Lingao and had never even been to the prefectural city of Qiongzhou, to understand. As for the Lingao dialect Xin Nachun spoke, strictly speaking, it wasn't even Chinese.

Fortunately, they could both speak a little "New Language." Although Xin Nachun was not a naturalized citizen and was not required to learn it, to "do business" in a place like Dongmen Market, where people from all over gathered, speaking only the local dialect was clearly not enough.

Thus, these two individuals, whose goal was to overthrow the Senate's regime, managed to connect and conspire using the Mandarin that the Senate was actively promoting.

"This is all thanks to you," Xin Nachun's voice was tinged with anger. If it weren't for carrying out the man's orders, she wouldn't have received those fifty lashes for no reason.

It was the man who had ordered her to go to the embankment for the meeting. She hadn't expected the other party to not recognize her as a "colleague" at all. The argument had even attracted the police.

If it weren't for her identity as a prostitute, which didn't arouse the police's suspicion, and if the other party had been lenient, she would be "passing through the hot hall" in the 髡's prison right now!

Speaking of which, she had taken a stroll by the Bridge of Helplessness.

At this thought, she couldn't help but feel a lingering fear.

"You got a temper after a beating? What a woman!" The man's face was not visible, but his tone was clearly smiling.

"I suppose the one with their ass up for a whipping wasn't you. It's easy to talk." At this point, the scarred wound on her buttocks itched, and Xin Nachun couldn't help but scratch it.

"Don't you stick your ass up for men to 'whip' every day? What's fifty lashes?" The man's words were both frivolous and contemptuous. "When I was working in the yamen back then, if I messed up a task, the superior would order eighty strokes of the military cane, and you weren't even allowed to cry out. The 髡 tickled your ass a bit and you're crying like this. If they really caught you and took you to the State Security Bureau, you'd turn around and sell me out in a heartbeat—" At this point, his tone became cold and cruel.

Xin Nachun's heart trembled. Her "superior," despite his usually honest and simple appearance, was inconspicuous among the naturalized citizens, but he was ruthless when it came to killing. She had personally seen him kill two people by the seaside, calmly and efficiently, tying rocks to them and throwing them into the sea. And it was she who had lured those two people to the seaside.

As for why those two people were killed, she had no idea, and her "superior" didn't allow her to know. But since then, she had followed her "superior" with utter devotion.

After Xin Nachun was released from the "correctional facility" that specifically housed and educated the relatives of bandits and similar "non-nationals," she had no means of livelihood. She was lazy and idle, a typical "female loafer" or "loose woman" of the countryside. Although the correctional facility had introduced her to a job, she found working in a factory like a clothing or textile factory too tiring, and working on a farm meant being exposed to the sun. As for commercial units, when people heard she was a "bandit's relative," no one was willing to hire her.

Unemployment was not allowed in Lingao. "Non-nationals" like her had to have a certificate of employment within thirty days of their release. Otherwise, they would be treated as "vagrants," which meant being directly "taken in for labor." That meant doing all sorts of hard and tiring work. In the end, she decided that being a yellow-ticket prostitute was a good option—it was easy and she could make money. So she registered and became a "self-employed" prostitute.

Dongmen Market had a large population, especially single men. Xin Nachun was young, good-looking, and had a "flirtatious" demeanor. She quickly became a popular figure among the "yellow tickets." She also had no family burden, so she lived quite well.

But a life of ease and comfort could not make her forget the hatred in her heart. In particular, she was obsessed with her lover—she didn't have much feeling for the several family members who were killed or executed in the anti-bandit campaign. They had always treated her poorly, taking her whenever they wanted and then leaving without a second thought, never giving her a good look, and often beating and scolding her. But she couldn't forget Zhao Dachong, and she had always harbored thoughts of revenge.

However, she had no idea how to get revenge. The Senate's rule was a typical "police state," with a strict legal net. A "female loafer" like her, used to running wild in the countryside, immediately suffered—it wasn't long before she was whipped for breaking the law. Although getting whipped in the correctional facility was a common occurrence, compared to the flogging in the punishment bureau, it could only be considered a form of amusement. The latter was so painful that she was left in a daze, not even knowing how she got off the punishment rack and back to the inn. She had to lie on her stomach for more than ten days before she could get out of bed.

Since then, although her hatred for the Senate had deepened, her fear had also grown stronger. The so-called revenge gradually became just a thought.

Until a few months ago, a chance encounter with a client led her to meet her "superior" and be recruited as an "operative." After personally witnessing her "superior's" Jinyiwei waist plaque, she threw herself into the work without a second thought. It seemed that having been suppressed by the 髡 for too long, she rebounded with particular ferocity, like a moth to a flame, without any regard for the consequences. Moreover, this superior's attitude towards her was not much different from the late Zhao Dachong's.

However, Zhao Dachong was just a country bandit, while her "superior" was a genuine "Jinyiwei" with an official position. His appearance and demeanor were no match for Zhao Dachong's. Even when he scolded her, his official dialect was clear and sonorous, much more pleasing to the ear than Zhao Dachong's local dialect. Gradually, the man she had been obsessed with faded from her heart, and her "superior" took over her entire body and mind.

"A whipping is nothing. I've suffered this kind of hardship before," Xin Nachun said, feigning nonchalance. "But that guy knew my identity. If he had shouted it out, I would have been doomed!"

"Hehe," the man sneered. "Is your head made of pig's brains? Can't you think at all? He's not clean himself. If he shouted it out, could he have gotten away? Since he could leave a Jinyiwei secret sign, even if he's not a colleague, he's at least some kind of agent. Do you think the 髡 would let such a person who has infiltrated Lingao go lightly?"

"This is..."

"You work for me, so you have to be smart and use your head. Don't just think about seducing men all day." The man's tone was full of contempt. "If something happens, we'll all be finished!"

"If I don't seduce men, what will I eat?" Xin Nachun said brazenly. "You want to serve the country with utmost loyalty, but I'm not interested."

"Serve the country with utmost loyalty," the man laughed啞然. "In this day and age, who still serves the country with utmost loyalty? I'm also forced to do this!" he said, angrily making a chopping motion with his hand. "Coming to this 髡's territory, I'm neither human nor ghost. If it weren't for—" At this point, he cautiously stopped himself. "Forget it, you wouldn't understand even if I told you."

As he spoke, he got up, took out a thick stack of circulation coupons from a satchel on the ground, and casually tossed them onto the bed.

"This is for your wound medicine."

"So much!" Xin Nachun, forgetting the pain in her buttocks, pounced on it and grabbed it. The movement pulled at her newly scarred wound. It had been itching unbearably, but now it was a sharp, stinging pain. She couldn't help but cry out.

"Don't be in a hurry, there's more," the man said with a cold smile. "Do you still have contact with that Shopkeeper Gou?"

"Yes, but his wife is very jealous. I can only go when I have time..." Xin Nachun grabbed the stack of bills. A rough count showed more than three hundred circulation coupons. Her mood immediately improved.

"Who asked you about that? Does he still exchange gold and silver privately?"

"Of course he does. That's his source of income. Otherwise, how could he survive on that small shop and the few small coins the 髡 give him? He's fallen for a girl on Heyuan Street and spent a lot of money."

"Is it safe?"

"No problem. The 髡 trust him very much. He's also careful himself. Only people introduced by acquaintances can make exchanges."

"What about this person? Is he reliable?"

"Just a spineless coward," Xin Nachun smiled. "But he has a lot of complaints about the 髡 now."

"Oh? Why?"

"Shopkeeper Gou was one of the first to surrender to the 髡 here. He used to be a cook at the Gou family village. Not long after the 髡 landed, they attacked the Gou family village. After it was taken, he was the first to stand up and turn against them. As a result, after all these years, the first batch of people who surrendered to the 髡 have all done well. Even the captured Gou family village retainers are now officers in the 髡 army. But him, he's just running a small eatery, relying on being an informant for the 髡 to get some subsidies. If it were you, would you be happy?"

"No wonder," the man nodded. He took out a mulberry paper package from his satchel and tossed it onto the bed. "Take this package of silver and exchange it for circulation coupons. Give it to me the next time we meet. You can give him a little something extra when you make the exchange."

Now, the entire Hainan Island prohibited the circulation of gold and silver as currency, but this did not mean that there was no demand for it among the people. Thus, a black market for the private exchange of gold and silver emerged. Although the scale of this black market was small under the crackdown of the National Police, gold and silver exchangers still existed secretly.

The "superior's" activities in Lingao required a large amount of funds. Circulation coupons could not be found in the Great Ming. Although some could be exchanged in places like Guangzhou and Leizhou, the quantity was very small. The only way was to import silver and then exchange it. This was also why the man had to recruit Xin Nachun. The local yellow-ticket prostitutes had freedom of movement and could have contact with various social classes, making them very useful tools for running errands and making connections.

"Why give him a benefit?" Xin Nachun was stunned. "Are you trying to recruit him?" she cried out. "That's absolutely not possible!"
