Wang Ci timidly walked onto the wooden terrace. The tables, covered with white tablecloths, were already set with tableware: plates and spoons were bone china fired in Lin'gao's own kilns, decorated with the "national emblem" of the Council of Elders: a golden double-headed eagle over a gear, wheat ears, and the Holy Ship. The wine vessels were glass cups, and only the chopsticks were bought from Guangdong, all wrapped in ivory. Each seat had a place card, making it easy for everyone to find their seat. After Wang Ci sat down, he found that Sun Ruiwu was sitting next to him, which put him a little at ease. He didn't want to sit with a barbarian.

Sun Ruiwu was puffing on a "Holy Ship" cigarette and looking around to see if anyone was serving food. Wang Ci looked at his clothes and knew that he was much more prosperous than before, and he felt a great sense of injustice. Besides being the registrar of Lin'gao, Sun Ruiwu was also the manager of the barbarians' grain collection bureau. He must have received many benefits from the barbarians and was a thorough Ming traitor.

Sun Ruiwu, however, was not as full of thoughts as Wang Ci. He greeted Wang Ci with a smile and asked about the usual official pleasantries, such as whether the county school's funds were sufficient. Of course, even if there was a problem, he could only "study it." Wang Ci could only give him a perfunctory reply.

"This ice sculpture is more magnificent than last year's," Zhang Youfu said from the opposite seat. He was still not quite used to sitting directly opposite several officials, staring at each other. His buttocks were a little restless, so he found a topic of conversation.

In the middle of the wooden terrace, just like last year, there was a huge ice sculpture. This time, the local stonemasons, under the guidance of an art major Elder, had finally carved something other than a stone lion—a dolphin leaping from the waves. Under the light of the gas lamps, it was crystal clear and dazzling, making it difficult to look at directly.

Last year, this would have been an amazing spectacle. But now, ice blocks were a common commodity in Lin'gao, affordable even for ordinary naturalized citizens and local wealthy people, so the ice sculpture did not arouse much amazement.

Several people pretended to admire the ice sculpture for a long time, and finally, the rumbling of someone's stomach broke the awkward silence. Everyone looked at each other, wondering why the food and wine hadn't been served yet. The aroma from the other side was wafting over, and everyone here was starving. Small landlords like Zhang Youfu and Fu Bu'er had even skipped lunch today, preparing to eat their fill at this meal.

Looking at the other tables, the Elders were already eating and drinking. The most incredible thing was that the barbarians were serving themselves! They were all holding large porcelain plates piled high with food, some also holding wine glasses, eating with great relish, either sitting or standing. What kind of etiquette was this?

Just as they were hesitating, a tall young woman came over, wearing a black dress and a white apron, and with a smile, she told them to get their own food from the buffet table.

Wang Zhaomin had had more contact with the barbarians and knew that those who wore this kind of clothing were the barbarians' personal maids, the most important people by their side who could not be offended. He quickly bowed with a smile and thanked her.

"...You gentlemen don't need to bring your plates to get food. There are clean plates over there," the maid said with a trained "All Nippon Airways" smile. "There are also drinks at the bar."

Everyone thought this was a novel approach. In ancient times, the gentry's banquets were full of elaborate rituals. Not to mention official banquets with their first and second offerings, even private banquets had a whole set of procedures for seating and etiquette. Now, the barbarians not only had no etiquette, but they also had to serve themselves food and wine. Wang Ci couldn't help but curse the barbarian thieves for their "lack of etiquette." Serving oneself from a plate, wasn't that like a beggar in front of a soup kitchen?

For a moment, the several officials and local gentry felt a little embarrassed—they had no servants to send. But the few local wealthy people were already starving. Regardless of etiquette, they bowed and went straight for the food. In a short while, they returned with plates full of delicious food. Now, no one could resist any longer. Even County Magistrate Wu stood up gracefully and strolled towards the food table.

Wang Ci endured for a moment, but finally couldn't bear the hunger in his stomach. The buffet table was brightly lit, and the aroma was overwhelming. Wang Ci hardly dared to approach the buffet table—the four words "pool of wine and forest of meat" flooded his mind. The food on it was too sumptuous! Not to mention in this small Lin'gao, even at the banquets of the great officials in his hometown's prefectural city, there had never been such a spread! The variety of food dazzled him. It was truly something he had never seen or heard of before. As he was marveling, he saw Zhang Youfu holding three plates with both hands, with another one on his arm, piled high with meat, vegetables, and seafood. He even had a skewer of roasted meat in his mouth.

Wang Ci dazedly followed an Elder in front of him and took a lot of food. He had not intended to take so much. Instructor Wang had always considered himself to be content with simple food and had a sufficient resistance to delicacies. He didn't expect that having the option to not eat and not having the option to eat were two completely different concepts. His stomach protested violently in the face of the good food, causing him to involuntarily take a lot of things: crab cakes, coconut fried shrimp, fried squid rings, onion rings, roasted chicken, and fried sweet potato fries. He also took a piece of chicken chop and a few small pieces of teppanyaki sirloin—he didn't know it was beef. Seeing someone frying eggs on an iron plate on the side, he asked for one. Master Wang lived a poor life, and eggs were also a luxury.

Then, he somehow found himself at the beverage table. There were large carved glass jars and small barrels lined up, containing liquids of several different colors. Wang Ci looked for a long time, not knowing what to choose. In the end, the maid behind the table scooped a ladle of a pale yellow liquid from a glass jar into a cup and handed it to him. He took a sip and felt that the wine was strong and the taste was refreshing. He couldn't help but drink several cups in a row.

"Sir, this is a strong liquor..." the maid said, seeing this gentleman drink several cups in a row and start to stumble. This was a cocktail made of rum, lemon juice, sugar, and water. It was easy to drink, but the after-effects were strong.

"Nonsense!" Wang Ci scolded with the air of a master, then returned to his table in a daze. He took a bite of the sirloin. The rich and fatty taste, combined with the spiciness of the black pepper, almost made him bite his own tongue. He quickly ate a fried shrimp and looked up to see several slender maids moving around, clearing the plates, their slender waists and full hips swaying like willows in the wind... This instructor suddenly felt a wave of sadness and shed tears. He realized that his past life had been a complete void.

The Elders did not have such complex feelings—although this was the first time since D-Day that they had had such a sumptuous meal. Especially the meat, which had never been so plentifully supplied before. Everyone ate to their heart's content. Wu Nanhai and a few other Elders were standing by the buffet table, talking loudly. Everyone had received Wu Nanhai's wedding invitation, so of course, they had to congratulate him when they met.

"This meal is so good, it's all thanks to your Ministry of Agriculture," He Ying said, already a little tipsy.

"The quantity is still not enough," Wu Nanhai said proudly. "The food we can supply for the 1632 New Year's reception will be even better. I'm raising several Wagyu cattle over there..." At this point, he realized he had misspoken and quickly looked around.

"It's fine, Xi Yazhou is staying in Sanya," He Ying comforted him.

"These few Wagyu cattle are all my breeding stock. When I have enough calves, I'll set up a special supply for the Elders—listening to music, drinking beer, feeding them apples, and getting ten young girls to massage the cattle. I don't believe I can't raise beef with marbled fat."

"Kobe beef?"

"There are many breeds of Wagyu cattle. Kobe beef is just one of them," Yang Baogui said, playing with the cup in his hand. "I think Imari-Gochiku beef is also good. It doesn't have so much fat."

Someone on the side said, "Old Wu! Is it appropriate for you to marry a maid as your first wife? I hear you're a Christian and can't have a second wife. Won't you have no chance to marry a young lady from a prominent family in the future?"

"What about the Li mother and daughter? Are you just going to abandon them like that?"

"I will still take good care of them," Wu Nanhai said casually.

Everyone showed a look of "I see," and some even nodded repeatedly in agreement. Wu Nanhai, completely unaware, continued, "I have always supported monogamy. Besides, it's better for a wife to be of humble origin. Even Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang stipulated that his daughters-in-law and sons-in-law should be chosen from commoner families. I think we will have many children in the future. If the mother's family is too powerful, the children will have an advantage. Then there won't be equal competition for the inheritance!"

"So you're learning from Zhu Yuanzhang," He Ying teased.

"I think this method is beneficial for maintaining family balance," Wu Nanhai said, having drunk a few more cups and in a talkative mood. "I'm also planning to learn from Emperor Kangxi and implement a secret succession system. The heir to the family head will be announced after my death. Before that, no one will dare to be lazy or cause disunity."

"Brilliant, you are truly brilliant."

"I think primogeniture is better, it's stable... Why learn from the Tartars of all people..." Liu Zheng sneered. "Primogeniture is the hallmark of all civilized societies!"

A group of people with no children immediately began to argue heatedly about the issue of inheritance. Wu Nanhai didn't want to continue this topic and quietly pulled He Ying aside:

"Liaison Officer He, what do you think about my application to build a small chapel at the farm?"

He Ying looked troubled. "Can't you just go to the Bairen church for joint services?"

"I'm a Protestant. We don't mix," Wu Nanhai said. "I'm not going to proselytize. It's just for myself and my family."

"But there's no Protestant church, and no pastor, right?"

Wu Nanhai smiled. "Our Protestant denominations generally don't care about that. I can be a pastor myself, preach, and conduct services." He added, "I'll pay for the expenses myself, and I'll arrange for the construction myself."

He Ying pondered for a moment. "This is a big matter. I have to submit it to the Council of Elders for approval."

"You should hurry up," Wu Nanhai said. "I'm planning to get married in the church."

As they were talking, the cheerful music from the loudspeakers changed to the "March of Unity and Friendship." The natives and naturalized citizens who had had more contact with the Elders all knew that when this music played, it meant that a major Elder was about to appear. The chatter and laughter in the venue gradually died down.

Sure enough, with the music, all the members of the Executive Committee and the People's Commissars and ministers of several important departments appeared one after another in front of the terrace. Two stage spotlights cast intersecting beams of light. Walking at the very front was Wen Desi, wearing a white suit without a tie, smiling and waving frequently to the crowd. Behind him was Ma Qianzhu, wearing a black stand-up collar Zhongshan suit, clapping with one hand and a serious expression on his face. The other Executive Committee members were all smiling and clapping lightly in a perfunctory manner.

The music stopped, and the venue fell silent. The leaders came to the arranged microphones, arranged in order of rank. Ma Qianzhu strode to the front of the stage and expressed his holiday greetings and condolences to everyone. Then he introduced the great situation of the 1630 anti-encirclement and punitive wars and economic construction, and then announced the Council of Elders' plans and tasks for the new year. He specifically mentioned the construction of the island-wide communication network and the round-the-island highway, as well as the upcoming expansion of population input from the mainland. If conditions were right, they would also import more special-needs populations of different races from Persia and Japan. Although the content was substantial, he spoke concisely and forcefully, and the audience erupted in applause and cheers from time to time. After he finished speaking, the venue was filled with excited discussions and laughter.

Wen Desi walked to the microphone and waved to the enthusiastically applauding Elders, native representatives, and naturalized citizen representatives. He first said a few words of congratulations, emphasizing that the achievements of 1630 were the result of everyone's resolute implementation of the various spirits and instructions of the Council of Elders, and a great victory of the collective leadership and full play of democracy within the Council of Elders.

"Comrades, I will not list the series of great victories we have achieved at sea and on land. This is just the beginning for us." After another round of applause, he continued, "Our regime is still a small force in this world. The tasks before us are glorious and arduous. To complete these tasks, we still need to make great efforts. After this period of testing, I believe that no difficulty, no enemy can crush us—" Another round of applause interrupted him. "The war has only temporarily ceased. The rulers in Beijing, Shengjing, Hanseong, and Tokyo continue to issue orders from their palaces... The Dutch still sail in Batavia... Around us, hidden enemies are still making their last desperate struggles. The struggle will be sharp and fierce, and it will continue for a long time. Our road is still long—the world is not yet ours, but one day, it will be ours!"

Thunderous applause, cheers, and fireworks that exploded in the sky with his final words shook the sea. Fireworks launched from warships and land burst into countless brilliant flames in the air. Flocks of seagulls and birds, startled, flew up from the reefs and forests, flapping their wings in the night sky, chirping and hovering over the sea. The world of Lin'gao had entered a new stage.
