[Xiao Zishan][y001] and his party hurriedly stood up to return the courtesy. Their initial fear and apprehension towards the people of this other time and space had also diminished considerably—they were living, breathing people, just like them. In particular, Gao Ju's actions in these past few trades made them feel that he was a man of considerable integrity, worthy of continued association, and would surely be of great help after their future transmigration.

After some pleasantries, they got down to business. With the help of the newly purchased hydraulic hand truck, they brought over a total of four pallets and more than a hundred boxes of goods.

[Xiao Zishan][y001]'s promotional items were all gone. The goods for this transaction were all wholesaled from the market. They had purchased many mirrors of various sizes and styles, disposable lighters, and various kinds of frosted and sandblasted glassware. [Wen Desi][y002] had done a lot of research and found that pearls were very valuable in the late Ming Dynasty, so he went and bought many cultured pearls, both large and small.

At that moment, the manager led his men to unpack the samples and present them to Master Gao for inspection. Master Gao was already mentally prepared for the fact that the Australian sea merchants would bring strange goods every time they came, but with each new item taken out, he was still secretly surprised. He was especially fond of the disposable lighter, which was far more convenient for making fire than any flint or fire-starter.

Master Gao examined the Wenzhou-made lighter in his hand—the translucent plastic no longer surprised him—and struck it several times. He stared at it for a long while and praised, "The method of making fire with this object is no different from a flint and steel, but it uses oil instead of tinder, and a wheel to strike the flint. There is nothing rare in it, yet the craftsmen of your esteemed country can combine such ingenuity into one body and create such an exquisite and convenient object. It is truly unparalleled."

[Wen Desi][y002] and the others nodded secretly. Who said the ancients were ignorant? Master Gao understood the principle of this lighter as soon as he held it. Of course, the gasoline inside was not something the ancients could produce, but he also realized that the liquid inside was oil.

"But this kind of lighter cannot be refilled with oil," [Wen Desi][y002] explained. "It is useless after it is used up."

"Is that so? What a pity, what a pity." Master Gao stopped flicking the lighter. "Why can't it be refilled? It would be a shame to waste such an exquisite and practical object."

*How do I explain the concept of disposable goods?* [Wen Desi][y002] thought. *If I told him about the disposable lifestyle of the time-space we came from, wouldn't it scare him to death?* So he said vaguely that the craftsmen were working on improvements.

After the goods were handed over, they had sold for a total of more than thirty thousand taels of silver. Among them were several full-length dressing mirrors that made Master Gao's eyes nearly pop out. If this thing were to enter the palace, even His Majesty the Emperor would be dumbfounded.

The pearls they brought also won Gao Ju's favor. Since the chaos in Liaodong, the supply of tribute pearls from the northeast had been cut off, and the harvest of South Sea pearls was not large. The market was severely short of stock.

Master Gao knew they liked gold, so he exchanged one thousand taels of gold for them. He also ordered people to take out the porcelain from the warehouse, put as much as could fit on the pallets, and tie them tightly with straw ropes. To be honest, he didn't know how these three people managed to transport more and more goods each time. Although he didn't dare to ask, he guessed that these people might know some kind of transportation magic.

[Xiao Zishan][y001], seeing the chests of gold and silver in the hall, felt a little dizzy. Fortunately, they had bought the hydraulic cart, otherwise how would they move nearly a ton of gold and silver... As he was lost in thought, he heard [Wen Desi][y002] ask about the matter of entrusting him to buy a house.

Gao Ju pondered for a moment and said, "This matter was originally not difficult. However, you gentlemen are all overseas merchants. According to the laws of our Great Ming, you cannot buy a house and reside here locally. Originally, you are all of Chinese descent, and your speech and appearance are also like Chinese. If you changed your clothes and lived here quietly, it would not be difficult. But recently, with these strange goods on the market, my place has attracted a lot of attention..."

At this point, they understood that the tall tree attracts the wind. They figured that with so many unprecedented things suddenly appearing in Guangzhou, there must be countless eyes and ears paying attention to this place.

But this meant that their original plan to set up a base in Guangzhou city had fallen through. According to a key part of the overall transmigration strategic plan, Guangzhou would serve as the mainland trade portal for the base, exporting modern industrial products manufactured in the Hainan base and importing various materials and personnel. At the same time, it would also be a window for observing the movements of the Ming Dynasty.

Seeing the disappointed look on the faces of [Wen Desi][y002] and his party, Gao Ju then revealed his own plan. He had considered this plan for a long time. In Master Gao's mind, the reason the Australian sea merchants wanted to buy a house was nothing more than that they needed a stable foothold to store goods and live in for their long-term trade. This was the same intention as when the Franks bribed high officials to lease Macau, only they were not so greedy.

"However, I have another idea..." Gao Ju stroked his few sparse whiskers and looked at the group expectantly.

"Please enlighten us, Master Gao."

"What you esteemed guests want is nothing more than a place to stay in the city. I have a place in the city. If you esteemed guests do not mind, you can use it."

At that, Gao Ju dismissed the maids, summoned two personal servants to accompany him, and led the way with the keys from his sleeve. The group passed through a side alley and reached the backyard. There was a smell of mule and horse urine in the air, so they knew they had reached the mule and horse yard. Seeing that Master Gao did not go in, but went directly around the corner of the wall, at the end of the alley was a small house. An old servant was sitting at the door. Seeing the master arrive, he hurriedly stood up.

"Open the door," Gao Ju ordered.

The old servant took out a key from under his clothes and led them into the house. On the wall of the inner room was another small, iron-clad door. After unlocking and unlatching it, they went out and found themselves outside the residence. This was an extremely secluded stone-paved path that extended along the base of the city wall. On one side was the wasteland at the foot of the wall, and on the other was the high wall of a large household's backyard. There was no one around, and weeds grew along the path. As they walked along, they could occasionally see side alleys.

"The alleys lead to the main road in front. The entrances to the alleys are all equipped with wooden gates, which are usually locked. Although this road is public land, ordinary people cannot enter."

After walking for several hundred meters, they came to a back wall that was extremely dilapidated from the erosion of wind and rain. Unlocking the door and entering, they found a small, bluestone-paved backyard. Some banana trees and flowers were planted, making it very quiet. Going further in was a small courtyard with three sections, tidied up very cleanly, and fully furnished with furniture and daily necessities.

"This is my outer residence. It was originally kept in reserve and not used."

It turned out that this was Master Gao's secret residence. He had several such residences in and around Guangzhou. This one was for temporary shelter in case of any disaster.

The front door of the residence did not face the street. Facing the street was a grocery store. On the surface, it was an ordinary oil and salt shop that did business with the large households on this street, but it was actually arranged by Master Gao. Next to the shop was an inconspicuous small door, with a side alley directly connected to the residence, making it convenient to enter and exit.

The residence was also looked after by servants. Seeing the master bring people, they hurriedly boiled water and served tea.

"We who trade on the seas must be very cautious!" Master Gao sighed. "Making a living is not easy."

In the smuggling business, the people one deals with are not good people. All kinds of river bandits, sea pirates, mountain bandits, and strongmen are people who are moved by the sight of wealth. Robbery, extortion, murder, and robbery are not news in this line of work.

Although they had backers in the prefecture, province, and the two capitals, the officials were tyrannical and often demanded extortion. Moreover, the court itself was suspicious of foreign trade, and there were often court discussions about prohibiting the Franks from trading in Guangzhou. Local high officials often used this to threaten the merchants in order to report their achievements.

"These are somewhat manageable! But recently, pirates have risen everywhere, and both foreign and Chinese ships have suffered greatly. Our livelihood has also become difficult."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] thought this was a good opportunity to inquire about the current situation of pirates on the coast of Guangdong and Fujian, so he deliberately said:

"We have sailed all the way from Australia, and the journey has been quiet."

"It is because you esteemed guests have heaven's blessing," Master Gao smiled bitterly. "But compared to Fujian and Zhejiang, it is still peaceful here. Haicheng has been completely ravaged now."

Since the second year of the Tianqi reign, sea pirates along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong had recruited followers and formed gangs, calling themselves kings and states. Among them, Yang Liu, Cai San, and Zhong Liu were the strongest. In the sixth year of Tianqi, the Fujian General-in-Chief Yu Zigao and the Guangdong navy launched a joint suppression campaign, pacifying Yang Liu. Cai San and Zhong Liu fled, which somewhat curbed the arrogance of the sea pirates.

However, not long after, pirate groups such as Zheng Zhilong, Zhong Lingxiu, and Li Kuiqi once again plundered the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang. The coast of Fujian suffered the most from their poison. Yuegang in Haicheng County, the largest export trade port in China since the opening of the market in the Longqing reign, was in ruins. The number of sea ships sailing from there had decreased significantly for fear of being plundered by the sea pirates.

"Here in Guangzhou, it has been quiet since the joint suppression by Governor Yu of Fujian and the provincial navy last year. The Franks, because of their interests in Macau, also patrol the mouth of the river."

So, during this period, the focus of pirate activity was on the coast of Fujian. This situation greatly boosted their confidence—at least they would not have to face BOSS-level figures like Zheng Zhilong and Li Kuiqi at the beginning.

"However, it is still best to be careful," Gao Ju said, reminding them. Although there were no major pirates on the coast of Guangdong, small groups of sea pirates and river bandits were as numerous as ox hair. They had come from afar and were unfamiliar with the place and people, so they had to be especially careful when docking and unloading their ships.
