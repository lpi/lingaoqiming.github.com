"How big can her brother be? He's only one year old. What's the problem?" Lin Ziqi asked curiously. "Does he not have a little chicken? Is he mentally retarded? Or does he already know how to lift his sister's skirt?"

"What nonsense are you talking about," Lin Fatian said with dissatisfaction. "I'm not saying any more."

"I was wrong. Dad, please tell me. Leaving a story half-told will kill a person with curiosity."

"Last time we were drinking together, he was complaining after he had too much to drink. There have been some family troubles at home recently." Lin Fatian hesitated, then drained the beer in front of him in one gulp. "His wife... personal secretary, is very restless."

Zhang Yunmi's father was an unsuccessful person in another time and space. He had done many jobs, but none of them had been successful. He knew a little bit about everything, but he was not good at anything. His wife had abandoned them and divorced him when Zhang Yunmi was very young. Before deciding to participate in the transmigration, he was a network administrator in a small company.

It was conceivable that such a profession would not be highly valued after transmigration. Zhang Yunmi's father had always been "basic labor." Even after a few years, when many of the ordinary Senators had been promoted to officials, he was only an unknown middle-level cadre in the Planning Commission: the director of the data department of the Planning Commission, managing the Planning Commission's computer database and the newly built huge card index system.

"...You also know what kind of person Uncle Zhang is. He doesn't have many ambitions and thinks that his current life is pretty good. The General Office takes care of his daily life, and Zhang Yunmi has grown up. His personal secretary has given him two children in a row, and he has a son. His life is quite prosperous."

"Isn't that great? How is Uncle Zhang's personal secretary restless? Does she not let him sleep with her? Or did she cheat on Uncle Zhang?"

"Where did you learn so much nonsense," Lin Fatian said with dissatisfaction.

"Please, your daughter is seventeen, not seven..."

Lin Fatian looked at his daughter. Indeed, from any angle, his daughter was already a "woman." But the image of his daughter that appeared in his mind was still the child who had held his hand tightly on the deck.

He sighed secretly, his heart filled with complicated emotions as he looked at Meng Lan, who was busy in the kitchen. He took another big gulp of beer before saying slowly:

"It was fine at first. But after his personal secretary gave birth to a daughter, she changed a little. How should I put it," he hesitated, seeming to consider what word to use, "...she became a little... 'dramatic'..."

"'Dramatic'? How so?" Lin Ziqi's mind was instantly filled with countless melodramatic plots from romance novels.

"Old Zhang didn't go into details. In short, she's very bad to his daughter..."

"What? She dares to abuse Zhang Yunmi? Is she looking for death!" Lin Ziqi's eyes widened in surprise. The image of Aunt Xue from "Romance in the Rain" immediately appeared in her mind.

"It's not that bad. But she's cold and sarcastic, and she's not active in doing housework. Every time Zhang Yunmi comes home, she doesn't even cook. Old Zhang always has to order takeout. Old Zhang said it started when she gave birth to a daughter, and it got worse after she had a son. When Old Zhang says a few words to her, she just says that she has to take care of two children now, and the younger one has just been weaned. How can she manage?"

"Why not hire a part-time maid to do it? Didn't the General Office have such a service long ago?" Lin Ziqi thought of Zhang Yunmi's usual behavior. She didn't seem to be abused, just not very willing to go home.

"He did. But Old Zhang said that his current wife—personal secretary, has a strange attitude. Every time Zhang Yunmi comes back, she has a long face. If Old Zhang shows a little more concern for Yunmi, there's no peace. She'll either find a small matter to beat her own daughter, or find a reason to threaten to kill herself... It's making Old Zhang's life miserable."

"She's that bold?" Lin Ziqi was very confused. In her understanding, the personal secretaries were all loyal to the Senators, and the Senators' kindness to them was "higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea." And from her past interactions with Meng Lan and other maids, Lin Ziqi knew that they took the hierarchy very seriously and completely considered themselves "servants."

It was hard to imagine a "servant" treating her master like this. You know, without the Senator, she, the personal secretary, would be nothing. She said, "Uncle Zhang is a Senator, and she's just a concubine... uh, a personal secretary. Isn't she afraid that Uncle Zhang will fire her in a fit of anger? The College of Arts and Sciences is full of prospective personal secretaries who haven't been assigned yet."

"Fire her? What about the children if she's fired? One is three and the other is one. Without a mother, even with a part-time maid, they can't be taken care of," Lin Fatian said with a bitter smile. "Besides enduring it, what can Old Zhang do?"

"That's true," Lin Ziqi understood a little. A personal secretary who had given birth was not just a personal secretary anymore; she was also the mother of a Senator's child, and the child was her greatest asset. She said angrily, "Using the child as a threat, that's too shameless!"

"Who says it isn't."

"But what is she trying to achieve by being so dramatic?" Lin Ziqi suddenly thought of this. To not live a good life and insist on causing trouble at home, there must be some ulterior motive.

"From what Old Zhang said, it seems she wants Yunmi to get married early..."

"What's that about?" Lin Ziqi said nonchalantly. "First of all, it's none of her business. Yunmi doesn't live at home much anyway, so she's not in her way. Besides, she'll be eighteen soon, and the General Office will naturally assign her a house. She'll move out without being pushed, so there's no need to be so dramatic."

"What do you know," Lin Fatian was still frowning for his drinking buddy, and said sullenly, "This woman's plan is that after Yunmi gets married, no one will compete with her son for the family property!"

Lin Ziqi was so angry that her face turned red. "Pah, how shameless! What right does she have to covet the family property? A personal secretary is at most a live-in mistress. She has a son and she's already thinking about the family property—Uncle Zhang must be blind!"

"Why else would you say Old Zhang regrets it? When he was drinking, he said that if he had known, he wouldn't have wanted any damn personal secretary. It would have been so much better to live quietly with his daughter! Anyway, he can just hire a part-time maid for housework."

"You men say it so nicely," Lin Ziqi sneered. "He's even younger than you, Dad. I don't believe he can endure it without a woman. I heard that Uncle Zhang was also a key figure in the maid revolution. He rushed to the entrance of the Executive Committee and was just short of smashing [Ma Dudu][y005] with a brick."

Lin Fatian really didn't know what to say to his daughter. He frowned and drank another half glass of beer. He smacked his lips. "Old Zhang is having a hard time now, so you should stop with the sarcastic remarks."

"He can't hear my sarcastic remarks. Besides, I'm not wrong," Lin Ziqi said. "Doesn't the General Office handle this kind of thing? Aren't all the personal secretaries managed by the General Office?"

"How can the General Office handle it? This is a family matter!" Lin Fatian emphasized the words "family matter." "As the saying goes, even an honest official can't settle family disputes. Besides, what can the General Office do? She hasn't done anything wrong. At most, they can just kick this woman out—but Old Zhang wouldn't agree to that either. Although it's not ideal, they are still a family. Once it goes to the yamen, it has to be handled officially. Old Zhang can't bear to have his two children without a mother!"

"In the end, it's all because Uncle Zhang is too soft," Lin Ziqi said with disdain. "If he were a little tougher, would that woman dare to be so arrogant? It's outrageous. Yunmi is a Senator! If Meng Lan dared to be like that, I would whip her into submission first!"

Before she could finish her sentence, there was a crisp sound of something falling to the ground in the kitchen. Lin Ziqi turned her head impatiently and asked, "What's wrong?!"

"Nothing... my hand slipped, and something fell."

Lin Ziqi sneered. "If you were more-care-ful, it wouldn't have happened!"

"I know, miss," Meng Lan answered tremblingly.

Lin Fatian said with dissatisfaction, "Don't get carried away. Why are you taking it out on Meng Lan?"

Lin Ziqi's face twisted. Her eyes blinked as if tears were about to fall. She covered her face and sobbed, "I don't even have a little brother yet, and you already dislike me..."

Lin Fatian was now flustered and quickly comforted her. "Xiao Qi, don't cry! Daddy doesn't want a son! You will always be daddy's good daughter..."

Lin Ziqi suddenly put down her hand and made a face. "I was just kidding! Don't worry, Dad. Even if that day comes, I won't make things difficult for you."

"Don't say that..." Lin Fatian showed a conflicted expression. "Daddy doesn't want you to be wronged—"

"Wronged? I won't be," Lin Ziqi said lightly. "I know how to handle it. I will never let you end up in Uncle Zhang's situation." She then sneered again. "Meng Lan," she said loudly, "serve the chicken soup."

That evening, Meng Lan served them with extra caution. She didn't even dare to sit down in front of Lin Ziqi, which made Lin Fatian shake his head. After all, he was a modern man who had grown up under the red flag and had a "simple affection for the working people." He couldn't stand this kind of "arrogant" behavior. Compared to his daughter, who had grown up watching palace intrigue dramas and romance novels, he was even less suited for this "clear hierarchy" situation.

However, family relationships were like that. It was either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. Otherwise, the family couldn't go on. So he was helpless.

Lin Ziqi read for a while and then yawned. She got up to change into her pajamas. Although the environment here was beautiful and the air was fresh, there was no internet in the Senator's apartment complex, nor was there an entertainment center with various modern gadgets. The entertainment was very poor. Lin Ziqi was already a little tired, and she had to go on a "hike" tomorrow, so she went to bed early.

The next day, she got up early. Lin Fatian was not up yet, but Meng Lan was already up, and a hot breakfast was on the table. After Lin Ziqi had breakfast, Meng Lan had already handed her the canvas bag.

"Everything is packed," she said respectfully.

She had already told her what to bring for the hike before she went to bed last night. Lin Ziqi took the bag. "I won't be back for lunch. You can just leave me dinner—you don't have to wait for me."

"Yes, miss."

"Dad is also off today, so you and Dad can have a good time together," Lin Ziqi suddenly smiled and put on her rattan sandals.

Meng Lan immediately blushed and didn't dare to say a word.

Lin Ziqi left the farm. At the designated exit, the Dongfeng carriage sent by the General Office was already waiting. Because the trip to Lingao Cape Park was not entirely in a green zone, and Lin Ziqi was a "minor Senator," she had to be accompanied by security personnel according to the regulations. So last night, Meng Lan had reported Lin Ziqi's itinerary for today to the General Office's service point at the entrance of the dormitory area.

"Good morning, miss," the guard company soldier standing next to the carriage step saluted. His handsome face and dashing posture made Lin Ziqi take a few more glances at him.

"Good morning." She lifted her skirt with one hand and stepped onto the footboard.

At this moment, the soldier helped her by the arm at just the right time.

"Please be careful when getting on the carriage," he reminded her politely.

"Thank you," Lin Ziqi smiled sweetly. She liked this little flattery.

The Dongfeng carriage was both clean and comfortable. The General Office's service department had cleaned and redecorated the vehicle last night as soon as they received the itinerary. The seat cushions, back cushions, and curtains had all been washed and changed, and the flowers in the vase had been replaced with fresh ones. A faint floral scent filled the air. In the cabinet, there were fresh glass bottles of mineral water, and in the ice bucket, there were iced kvass and soda.

The carriage began to move forward with the clatter of horse hooves. Without her instructions, the coachman would naturally follow the route on the itinerary issued by the General Office and deliver her to her destination on time.

The carriage trembled slightly as it rolled on the flat road. Lin Ziqi looked out the window. The weather was very good today. It had rained a few days ago, so the air was fresh, not too cold and not too hot. It was a good day for an outing.

*Thank you for bringing me here, Dad,* Ziqi said to herself quietly.

Although there were no Mercedes-Benz, BMW, or Rolls-Royce in this time and space, and she was only riding in a two-wheeled carriage, in this time and space, the people who could ride in this carriage were more noble and powerful than those who could afford to ride in a Mercedes-Benz or BMW in the other time and space.

Although Lin Ziqi loved to watch palace intrigue dramas since she was a child and was obsessed with princess and Cinderella-type movies and TV shows, she also knew very well that in the original time and space, unless she had explosive good luck, her future would inevitably be to marry a man from a similar family background, and the two of them would have to scrimp and save to pay off their mortgage, and drive an "economy family car" to and from work—and they would also have to worry about parking...

Now, she was a genuine "princess," riding in a carriage, escorted by guards, and served by a respectful personal secretary at home. What was the so-called "fashionable life" in those fashion magazines? What was buying an island? One day, she would even have Tahiti all to herself. Queen of Tahiti? Too common. Queen consort of Tahiti? Then there would have to be a king. How about just calling herself the female ruler? That didn't sound right...

The carriage took her all the way to the Feiyun Club at Lingao Cape Park. The Feiyun was moored at the pier in the bay, with all its sails unfurled. Although this ship had been in this time and space for almost six years and had made several long voyages, it was still in good condition. It was clear that the Qian family had put a lot of effort into maintaining it.

On the beach, the coconut grove planted on D-Day had already grown to a considerable size. Under the grove were three stilt houses. This was the location of the Feiyun Club. Lin Ziqi and her classmates from the learning institute had held bonfire parties and barbecues here more than once. They had also had parties with the children from the selection group here. She had even sung a few songs, which had made the boys from the senior primary school selection group look at her with fiery eyes...

At this moment, behind these three thatched houses, there was a new boat rack, on which a beautiful small boat was resting. The boat was not large, at most five or six meters long, with a very tall mast. Because there was no suitable paint, it still retained its original wood color, which looked very beautiful against the blue sea and silver sand.

Qian Duoduo was wearing a sailor shirt and canvas shorts, a hard-topped straw hat, and was barefoot. She was holding a tin bucket and squatting by the boat rack, painting something on the hull. Seeing Lin Ziqi arrive, she put down her brush and came over excitedly.

"Look, what do you think of this boat?" she said, waving her hand proudly, showing off her new toy.

"This boat is so beautiful," Lin Ziqi said sincerely. Although she knew nothing about boats, the light and beautiful hull, the streamlined body, and the straight mast immediately gave a sense of well-proportioned beauty.

"It's a pity we can't make white paint, otherwise it would look like a white swan!" Qian Duoduo said with intoxication. In Lin Ziqi's opinion, the boat was beautiful enough as it was. The hull was the color of natural wood, with beautiful wood grain all over it.

This boat was designed and built by Qian Shuiting according to the drawings of a common American small boat. This kind of small boat had ready-made drawings and accessories for sale in stores and could be assembled in one's own courtyard or even garage. It was usually placed on a trailer. The length ranged from 17 to 21 feet. The Qian brothers had collected many drawings and specialized tool books in electronic form and had also brought a set of special tools.

The small boat they had built this time was 17 feet (5.18 meters) long and 7 feet 4 inches (2.26 meters) wide. Although it didn't look big, a well-built small boat of this kind could not only sail along the coast, but with the right equipment, it could even be used for ocean voyages.

"What kind of wood is this? The grain is so beautiful," Lin Ziqi said, looking at it.

"The deck is teak," Qian Duoduo said. "The hull is fir, and the keel is made of Philippine mahogany. There are so many good woods in the lumber mill, it's hard to choose."

Lin Ziqi nodded repeatedly. In fact, she couldn't tell one kind of wood from another. She just felt admiration. No wonder Qian Duoduo's father could be the speaker. As the saying goes, he can hunt in the mountains, shoot on the plains, and build boats at sea. He also has a double master's degree... Her own father was no match for him.

It was really true that comparison is the thief of joy.

"How long did it take to build?" Lin Ziqi asked, carefully stroking the hull. "Did your father build it all by himself?"

"It took about a year. My father and I built it together. Uncle Zhou and Second Uncle also helped when they came back to Lingao. It's said to be over a year, but it was actually only built during the holidays. There's no time usually."

"You're amazing," Lin Ziqi said sincerely. "So amazing."
