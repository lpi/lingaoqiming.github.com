The rest of the day was very fulfilling for the four who had arrived. The banquet sent by Master Gao was a "grand four-piece set," with twelve dishes.

The style of the dishes was not quite the same as modern Cantonese cuisine, but its strength lay in the natural ingredients and meticulous cooking. It was sweet, fresh, rich, and moist. In particular, a thick soup of Xishi's tongue made the several of them nod in approval again and again.

Bei Wei thought to himself, *it's good to be a leader. How could the common masses enjoy such an opportunity for corruption in the Ming Dynasty?* Just as he was thinking, Gao Qing's wife, Gao Xian, brought up the reheated main course from the kitchen. It was a full plate of meatballs the size of pigeon eggs, soaked in a shallow clear soup, tender and glistening, sprinkled with green chopped scallions.

[Wen Desi][y002] was the first to pick up a spoon and put one in his mouth. With one bite, a fresh and clean taste filled his mouth, with a faint numbing spice of Sichuan pepper in the aftertaste. [Chief Wen][y002] was a man who had seen his share of social occasions in his own time. Although he wasn't having small banquets every three days and large ones every five, his experience with food was second to none among the transmigrators. Yet, with this one bite, he couldn't tell what it was made of. It felt like it had both chicken and seafood. He asked:

"What is this?"

"This is a treasure of land and sea," Gao Xian said softly. "It's made by mixing turtle meat, large silverfish, chicken, frog, and white shrimp together. Does master like it?"

"Good, it's truly a good taste."

"Mmm, mmm, it's indeed not bad."

"Landlords really live a decadent life," said [Engineer Wang][y003] with a look of envy, clearly an expression of wanting to be decadent but being unable to.

"Making such a fuss over a meatball!" Bei Wei pursed his lips.

"Almost every one of these dishes has Sichuan pepper in it, which has somewhat ruined the originally very good taste." [Wen Desi][y002] shook his head, seeming to find it a pity. "The ingredients are so fresh, and they are purely natural..."

"This seems to be a habit in Ming Dynasty cooking. In the Southeast Asian spice export trade, the Great Ming is also an important market."

"This entrepôt trade can be done."

As they were talking, Gao Xian brought over six small dishes, all of which were smoked and cured snacks, things to accompany wine. She came over to warm the wine, but saw that the jar of Jinhua wine that came with the banquet had not been touched. She hesitated for a moment and asked:

"Masters are not drinking wine?"

"No wine." Because they were afraid that drinking would interfere with their work, they did not touch a drop of alcohol in the Ming Dynasty time-space.

"Since the masters are unwilling to drink wine, how about some flower dew that I distilled myself, mixed with water?"

"Flower dew? Like toilet water?" Everyone was taken aback.

"Yes, I distilled it all myself. Right now, I only have two kinds, rice leaf and perilla. If the masters don't mind, please try some."

When it was brought out, they saw that it was an essential oil liquid distilled from plant leaves and flowers. The distillation technology for alcohol was already mature in the Ming Dynasty, and besides making liquor, making flower dew was also an important use for small stills.

When mixed with clean water and drunk, it indeed had a unique, fresh, and elegant taste.

But a doubt arose in [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s heart. This Gao Xian was clearly a tenant farmer's wife, and a rough servant in the Gao family, yet she knew how to make flower dew and also knew the recipe for the dishes... He couldn't help but scrutinize this woman carefully, and found that in her movements, her every gesture had a certain grace, unlike her husband's clumsiness.

Wanting to investigate, he stopped her and asked, "Sister-in-law Gao, you have served in the main residence before, haven't you?"

Gao Xian trembled and said in a low voice, "Yes, this servant has always been in the Gao residence..."

"That can't be right. You were a rough servant in the Gao residence. How do you know the recipe for this treasure of land and sea? And where did you learn to make flower dew?"

Gao Xian became even more flustered and stammered, "It was... it was taught by my sisters... I have made a fool of myself in front of the master..."

"How old are you?"

"This servant is thirty."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] looked at her face, which, although it had become dark, still faintly showed the charm of her youth. He thought of Gao Lujie's appearance, and then of the age difference between the couple. He already understood eight or nine-tenths of the situation in his heart, but there was no need to expose it at this moment.

He pondered for a moment and looked outside the hall. There was no one else. Gao Qing was probably working in the backyard. He then said:

"These days, does Gao Qing often go to Master Gao's place?"

"..." Gao Xian was suddenly startled, but said nothing. [Xiao Zishan][y001] knew he was right: Master Gao must often ask Gao Qing for news about them.

"That Manager Yan also comes often, right?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] just asked slowly.

"He hasn't come... only occasionally..."

"So has he not come, or has he come occasionally?!"

"He... has come occasionally, just as an acquaintance visiting..." Gao Xian lied through her teeth. She was already in a state of panic under this wave of questioning. Master Xiao's words implied that he knew everything, including her past. This, how could this be possible? As she was hesitating, she saw [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s face gradually darken. Knowing that things were not good, she knelt down before the table with a thud:

"This servant deserves to die, I should not have deceived the master..."

Bei Wei had been a revolutionary soldier under the red flag. How could he stand to see such a thing? Just as he was about to speak, he was stopped by [Wen Desi][y002]. Although [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s questioning was sudden, it was also part of their plan to win people's hearts.

"He has come quite a few times, right? I'm afraid he has even gone into the courtyard where we live to have a look."

"No, no." Gao Xian was so scared her face changed color.

"And he also made you a promise, saying that if one day we return to Australia, he will take you back into the Gao family, is that right?!"

Gao Xian trembled all over—the masters knew everything! She couldn't help but secretly resent her husband for having no backbone. Every time Manager Yan cajoled and threatened him, he would agree to let him search the place. Although nothing was found, this was the crime of betraying one's master!

"This servant deserves to die, it's all my husband's fault..." Gao Xian, terrified by [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s words, prostrated herself and begged for forgiveness, confessing everything about Manager Yan's visits and words while they were away.

"My husband has soft ears and a weak heart, and was wrongly misled by others' nonsense," Gao Xian said, her voice already choked with sobs. "I beg the master to consider his old age and his leg ailment, and spare him the family punishment. This servant is willing to receive double the punishment in his stead."

What they heard was not much different from what they had estimated beforehand. Seeing her plead so bitterly for her husband, they couldn't help but feel a sense of pity. One really doesn't know the sweetness of the new society until one has been in the old one.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] deliberately waited for a long time before letting out a long sigh:

"Sister-in-law Gao, since your whole family has been assigned to our name, have we done anything to wrong you?"

"You are too kind to this servant. My whole family is endlessly grateful for the masters' benevolence."

"Your family did not have enough to eat, so we gave you monthly rice. Your children are grown and have no spending money, so we gave them a monthly allowance. We do not ask for gratitude in return. We only hope to have a peaceful place to rest after traveling thousands of miles across the waves to get here. We do not want to be watched in every detail."

Gao Xian did not answer, only sobbed and kowtowed repeatedly.

"Get up."

"This servant dares not. I ask the master to punish this servant heavily according to the family rules to uphold the family discipline."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] thought, *this woman really has her ways*. It seemed she was indeed not the wife of an ordinary peasant.

"Without rules, nothing can be accomplished. Although you and Gao Qing were at fault in this matter, we had not set any rules beforehand, so let's consider it ignorance is no crime. Get up."

"Thank you for the master's grace." Gao Xian heard that the master's tone had changed, and estimated that they would not be driven away. She was not afraid of being beaten with a plank, but she was afraid of angering the master and being driven away. Even if Master Gao was willing to take them in, they would not have a good life in the future.

"As for future matters, do you understand?"

"Yes, this servant knows."

"I know you are not from a humble background. You are much better at understanding things than Gao Qing. In the future, you must teach him well, to know when to advance and when to retreat!"

"This servant knows, knows." Gao Xian nodded repeatedly.

"As long as you serve with diligence and loyalty, whether we return to Australia in the future or not, we will not leave you without a proper outcome. Conduct yourselves well."

"This servant thanks..." Gao Xian was about to kneel down again to express her gratitude, but [Xiao Zishan][y001] stopped her—it was better to show less of the landlord master's authority in front of everyone. "Go and call Gao Di here."

After Gao Xian had left, [Xiao Zishan][y001] turned his head and said to everyone, "How was my acting?" He was anxious to change the atmosphere in the hall. He didn't want to give the impression of being domineering. Acting, yes, it was just acting.

[Wen Desi][y002]'s mouth fell open: "[Zishan][y001], were your ancestors really poor peasants?"

"Of course they were."

"You are simply a Golden Horse Best Actor," [Engineer Wang][y003] also exclaimed in admiration.

"You scared the woman. Wasn't that a bit much?" Bei Wei felt a little sorry for her.

"It was a bit much, but to balance kindness and power, this level is the minimum." [Xiao Zishan][y001] nodded. "We are surrounded by eyes. If we don't turn this situation around, we won't be able to carry out our work in the future."

[Wen Desi][y002] said, "Giving them benefits in the past was 'kindness.' Now is the time to show 'power.'"

"Yes," [Xiao Zishan][y001] explained. Since they couldn't gouge out these "eyes" for now, they could only "turn the eyes" to their side.

"Will this be enough?"

"It's just the beginning. Loyalty is not something that can be built with just a few words. It's very difficult to recruit followers."

To gain loyalty, the first thing is to have strength—no one will be loyal to a weak individual or organization; the second is to have benefits. Only with benefits will there be the motivation to strive. In the past, they had given benefits. Now, they had to show their strength. When it reached a certain level, it would naturally fall into place.

"I see that the transmigration predecessors all had it easy. With just a few words, their followers would bow down to them."

"We don't have the protagonist aura, do we?"

"You can have it, I don't want it..."

The atmosphere at the dinner table became lively again. [Xiao Zishan][y001] secretly breathed a sigh of relief. In fact, he was not very confident about this conversation, but he had taken advantage of the woman's fear of her past.

After a while of talking, Gao Di came. Although he was young, he was very clever. Seeing his mother's red eyes, he knew something was wrong and hurriedly brought the account book over to see them.

[Wen Desi][y002] casually asked about the family situation and looked at the account book—this account book was just a running account, and the income and expenditure of the residence were simple, so it didn't take long to understand. He then praised him a few more times. Seeing that his uneasiness was gradually dissipating, he then asked:

"Do people from the Gao family come often recently?"

"They come often!" The boy did not hide it at all and nodded vigorously. "That Yan Xiaomao comes often, and every time he whispers with my father."

"Yan Xiaomao (Yan Small Hat)?" [Wen Desi][y002] was taken aback for a moment, then realized he was talking about Manager Yan—he often wore a six-in-one small hat.

"What do they talk about?"

Gao Di hesitated for a moment. [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, "Just say whatever you want."

"It seems that Yan Xiaomao is always asking about the masters' news," Gao Di said. "But my father doesn't let me listen to them talk."

"Are the people of the Gao family good to you?"

"Good?" Gao Di didn't quite understand this question. "I don't know if they are good or not. I... have never served in the Gao family. The several masters in the accounting office are quite good to me, and there are a few other children. We often play together."

"Are they all slaves of the Gao family?"

"Yes, some are born in the house, and some are like me."

"Among those children, is there anyone you are particularly good with?"

"There are quite a few. Little Li, Little Qian, the Wang brothers..."

"Good. Come to the study in a while and make a list of names," [Wen Desi][y002] instructed.
