"Listening to Brother Zhanfeng's words at the tea stall, it seems you're quite familiar with Lin Zhuang?" Chen Tianxiong got straight to the point.

"Familiar is an understatement," said Xiao Zhanfeng. "He was my neighbor!"

It turned out that Lin Zhuang and Xiao Zhanfeng's families had originally lived on Haian Street. Xiao Zhanfeng's father, having little land, had started a small business and managed to prosper. To ensure his son could get a good education and make a name for himself, he moved the family to the county seat to attend a better private school.

"Lin Zhuang, ever since he was a kid, was the leader of the pack," Xiao Zhanfeng said with a smile. "He loves to be in the limelight, values loyalty, and enjoys making friends. He used to be a decent fellow. What a pity!" He shook his head. "The man fell in with the wrong crowd and picked up some bad habits. The hard-earned money he made stoking fires at the sugar mills was either spent in the brothels or lost at the gambling tables."

"So that's how it is." Chen Tianxiong thought to himself that this was merely a matter of private morals. Drinking, whoring, and gambling didn't necessarily mean a lack of ability, just as a perfect gentleman wasn't always a great talent. If this was the extent of Xiao Zhanfeng's insight, it was a bit weak.

"...But those are minor flaws," Xiao Zhanfeng's face flushed slightly—he rarely drank distilled spirits. "It's just that with these habits, his character has inevitably suffered. Take this recent incident, for example—"

When Lin Zhuang took the lead in filing a complaint with the county yamen, the sugar mill workers had pooled their money. As the saying goes, "The yamen gates are open wide, but with no money, don't go inside." Any lawsuit, win or lose, required a sum of money to grease the palms of officials high and low.

"And what did our good Lin Zhuang do? Using the lawsuit as an excuse, he collected a good deal of money from the workers and pocketed at least half of it himself. When the case was lost, he claimed all the money was spent, pocketing the rest and leaving everyone broke."

"And that's not all. Later, Third Master Zhu gave him silver to keep the sugar mill workers in line, preparing to make trouble for you. I don't know how many times he's taken money. But recently, I saw him lose more than a dozen taels of silver at the gambling tables in one go. Meanwhile, the old and young at the Zou Heshang Temple are drinking moldy rice porridge every day. For them to have him as a leader, this group of sugar mill workers must be truly blind."

This account was a far cry from the "fairly upright man" that Zhou Shidi had heard about; it sounded more like a "despicable villain."

"But isn't his reputation on the outside that he's a decent man?"

"Heh, the average person doesn't know about his tricks. He puts on a good act, wearing ragged clothes all day with a sorrowful look on his face. But if you go to Sister-in-law Ai's place on County Back Street, you'll see his true colors. It's as clear as day."

"Who is Sister-in-law Ai?"

Xiao Zhanfeng paused, then smiled. "That's right, you've only been here a few months, of course you wouldn't know."

Sister-in-law Ai was a famous local madam who ran a large "private brothel." Most of the county's unregistered prostitutes used her establishment as their base. Besides women, she also ran a casino, making it a den of indulgence for the lower echelons of Xuwen County society.

"Are you very familiar with Sister-in-law Ai?" Chen Tianxiong asked suddenly, testing his honesty. Chen Tianxiong believed that a person having some flaws wasn't a big deal; what he feared was a hypocrite. Xiao Zhanfeng spoke with great enthusiasm about others, yet his words revealed a familiarity with casinos and brothels, suggesting he was no saint himself.

"Not with her, but I'm very familiar with someone inside," Xiao Zhanfeng said, seemingly oblivious to Chen Tianxiong's intent, his interest piqued. "I'm a poor man. Sister-in-law Ai has very snobbish eyes."

It turned out he had a distant relative, a widow for many years, who now worked as a maid in the kitchen there. Xiao Zhanfeng often went to see her.

As for why he frequented Sister-in-law Ai's place, he remained silent, clearly it wasn't something to be proud of. Chen Tianxiong guessed it had something to do with this widow. It wasn't appropriate to press further.

Without asking more, they chatted about various topics. Xiao Zhanfeng was extremely interested in Huanan's mechanized sugar production. Chen Tianxiong catered to his interest, explaining some basic principles. Unfortunately, Xiao Zhanfeng's education consisted solely of the Thirteen Classics. He was completely out of his depth with science and technology, having never even read ancient Chinese texts on the subject, which made explaining it quite difficult.

"From this, it seems we are but frogs in a well!" Although Xiao Zhanfeng understood only two out of every ten sentences, he listened with great enthusiasm, finally uttering this phrase.

"It's just that Huanan's situation is now precarious," Chen Tianxiong said, seeing the time was right to bring the conversation back.

Xiao Zhanfeng said cryptically, "How so?"

Chen Tianxiong then recounted how Third Master Zhu was preparing to have the sugar mill workers cause a disturbance.

Xiao Zhanfeng nodded. "I've heard rumors of this. However, I believe this trouble won't amount to much. Even if it does, it will be all thunder and no rain."

"Why do you say that?"

"Hasn't Manager Chen heard of 'nurturing a threat to increase one's own importance'?"

This remark was a wake-up call for Chen Tianxiong. Xiao Zhanfeng said smugly, "What kind of person is Lin Zhuang? All bark and no bite. Never mind that the yamen will investigate if things get out of hand; at the very least, he can't escape being detained for a few days and receiving a beating. Even if Third Master Zhu helps him smooth things over with the yamen, he'll still have to suffer. Besides, if he really brings down Huanan, isn't he afraid that Third Master Zhu will burn the bridge after crossing it?"

"Indeed, indeed!" Chen Tianxiong suddenly realized this scholar's perspective was quite sharp. Once Huanan fell, Third Master Zhu would have no reason to keep giving him silver to maintain the group of sugar mill workers. On the contrary, the workers would be grateful to Third Master Zhu. How could Lin Zhuang, who profited by playing both sides, continue to thrive?

"Then, in Mr. Xiao's opinion, how should this be resolved?" Chen Tianxiong asked with newfound respect.

"Just call me Zhanfeng." Xiao Zhanfeng, likely unaccustomed to such respect, felt a surge of "a scholar would die for a friend who truly knows him." He then poured out all his thoughts on the matter.

"Third Master Zhu also knows Lin Zhuang is unreliable. So he's organized another group—that bunch of ruffians led by Zhao Jijiao. They are desperados who fear nothing, but they are too few in number to make a real impact. So, to cause trouble for Huanan, the sugar mill workers and the ruffians are two sides of the same coin. If the workers don't act, the ruffians can't fish in troubled waters." Xiao Zhanfeng tapped and drew on the table with his chopsticks. "Lin Zhuang knows Third Master Zhu's game. If Zhao Jijiao's men cause trouble, the sugar mill workers will surely take the blame. That's why he's been dragging his feet, trying to get more benefits from Third Master Zhu. But if Lin Zhuang is pushed into action by Third Master Zhu, things could get serious."

Chen Tianxiong listened carefully. Comparing this with what he'd said before, didn't Xiao Zhanfeng's current statement contradict his earlier claim that "the trouble won't amount to much"? After a moment's thought, he concluded that this man was, after all, a scholar, prone to making "startling pronouncements."

But there was no need to point it out now. Overall, his analysis was sound, and he provided many details they hadn't known. Being a local, he had a clearer understanding of the situation.

"So—"

"So, as long as you win over Lin Zhuang, Zhao Jijiao's group won't be able to make a move."

"I had the same idea!" Chen Tianxiong said. "But I heard it's already too late, that they're going to burn incense and take an oath at the Zou Heshang Temple in three days..."

"Everyone in Xuwen knows about that." Xiao Zhanfeng was dismissive. "Manager Chen, think about it: if you're really going to cause trouble, you'd conspire in secret and then suddenly gather to burn incense and take an oath. Who announces the incense-burning three days in advance for the whole town to know? Besides, Lin Zhuang's so-called incense-burning is just an 'oath-taking'; he never said he would act immediately."

He grew more animated as he spoke. "Lin Zhuang is just being pushed by Third Master Zhu and making a gesture. It's a way to justify the silver he's taken. So, he definitely won't make a move in three days. Do you think a leader would be spending his time in a brothel, gambling and whoring, just days before launching a major action?"

So that was the true meaning behind Xiao Zhanfeng's "all thunder and no rain." Chen Tianxiong nodded to himself. This man was indeed capable.

"So there's still plenty of time to win over Lin Zhuang."

"Does this mean Lin Zhuang is not at the Zou Heshang Temple?" Chen Tianxiong asked.

"Why would he be there!" Xiao Zhanfeng said. "Ever since Third Master Zhu recruited him, he's been living at Sister-in-law Ai's place, enjoying a life of pleasure. He's probably still there now."

"Then I must meet him and 'make a friend'." Chen Tianxiong cupped his hands. "I'll have to trouble Brother Zhanfeng for guidance!" he said. "I'm an outsider, completely in the dark on how to handle this. I'll be relying on your help."

"Of course, of course!" Xiao Zhanfeng returned the gesture. "If there's anything I can do, I will certainly do my utmost."

Seeing he didn't hesitate, Chen Tianxiong knew he was a man who shouldered responsibility. He took out ten taels of silver and placed it on the table.

"Listening to you speak is better than ten years of study," Chen Tianxiong said. "Brother Zhanfeng, your days are hard. Please take this silver as a subsidy. There will be more thanks to come!"

"I can't accept this." Xiao Zhanfeng refused flatly. "Money, I absolutely will not take. Please take it back. I spoke to you as a friend. If we hadn't hit it off, I wouldn't have said a word even for ten thousand taels."

This was a man of some integrity, although his last statement sounded a bit like boasting to Chen Tianxiong. He put the silver away. "In that case, I will come again tomorrow, and I will ask Brother Zhanfeng to lead the way to win over Lin Zhuang."

"What's so difficult about that? We can go today."

"No, no," Chen Tianxiong said. "I have a few other matters to attend to. Since things haven't reached that point yet, tomorrow will be soon enough."

Chen Tianxiong returned to the sugar company with Zhou Shidi. Although he hadn't met Lin Zhuang, befriending someone like Xiao Zhanfeng was a great gain. Chen Tianxiong had a habit of cooling his head when he was excited. After a moment's thought, he called Zhou Shidi in.

"Master Zhou!" he said, getting straight to the point. "What do you think of this Xiao Zhanfeng today? Can he be trusted?"

Zhou Shidi, with his long experience as a caravan guard, was a good judge of character.

"He can be trusted," Zhou Shidi said without hesitation.

"Mm, I also feel this man is useful," Chen Tianxiong said. "But one can't be too careful. This is a critical time. I'll have to trouble you to take a few local brothers and look into Xiao Zhanfeng's background."

"Very well, I'll go at once." Zhou Shidi left immediately.

That evening, the sugar factory workers who had gone to persuade the unemployed mill workers returned one by one. A single day naturally didn't yield significant results, but the news they brought back was clear. Many of the unemployed workers were demoralized and felt hopeless about the future. Although Lin Zhuang provided a daily supply of coarse rice to get by, everyone felt that living on handouts was not a long-term solution.

The incense-burning and oath-taking was indeed happening. And recently, people had been constantly inciting them to attack the Huanan Sugar Factory, claiming that once Huanan was destroyed, the sugar mills in Leizhou would be restored. The master sugar boilers were the most enthusiastic—after all, a return to the old methods would benefit them the most, so they were willing to take the risk. However, the ordinary workers felt that attacking the factory and engaging in brawls was tantamount to "breaking the law." Even if the old methods were restored, it was just for a meal. Thus, their enthusiasm was low. Coupled with the ambiguous attitude of their leader, Lin Zhuang, who refused to take a clear stance, no one was willing to be the first to step forward, leading to a stalemate.

This seemed to confirm Xiao Zhanfeng's judgment that the "incense-burning" was merely an "oath-taking" and not an "uprising." Chen Tianxiong instructed his men to continue their activities the next day, hinting to the unemployed workers that Huanan was willing to hire them, not only offering a wage but also providing for their families.

Regardless of how many unemployed workers they could win over, it would at least sow discord—though it seemed Lin Zhuang had never truly united them anyway. This ancient labor leader was too full of selfish thoughts to achieve anything significant.

From this perspective, success was eighty to ninety percent certain. Buying over Lin Zhuang tomorrow probably wouldn't take much effort.

The next day, accompanied again by Zhou Shidi, the two disguised themselves as a traveling merchant and his servant. They first took a sedan chair secretly to the "Dachang Rice Shop" in the county seat. This was where Liao Daxing had once worked as an assistant, so the two establishments had an unusual relationship. All the rice for Huanan was procured from there. The shop's owner, Boss Zhu, was naturally extremely attentive to such a major client.

To avoid potential spies, they waited until they arrived before sending an assistant to invite Xiao Zhanfeng over. After Xiao Zhanfeng arrived, he led Chen Tianxiong's party toward Sister-in-law Ai's house.

They entered through the front door and exited through the back. Behind the rice shop was a small alley. After walking a few dozen meters, they turned onto a long street paved with smooth, neat flagstones. Looking ahead, the buildings were orderly and impressive. The attire of the pedestrians was also much neater than in Lin'gao—thanks to the prosperous sugar trade, Xuwen was a fairly wealthy place.

But private brothels were never in bustling areas. Xiao Zhanfeng led the way, a turning past the front of the county yamen and entering a secluded area behind it. The roads here were mostly flanked by the rear walls of large households, with high firewalls and only small doors. There were few pedestrians.

After a few more turns, they stopped before a small double door. Xiao Zhanfeng halted and said, "This is the place."
