After checking to ensure Huang Tianyu's life wasn't in danger, Liu San turned to the inn's manager and berated him.

"What kind of inn is this? A den of thieves!"

The manager approached, his face a mask of misery, bowing repeatedly. "It is our fault. Please, sirs, calm your anger."

*What a close call!* Liu San thought. Catching this Qianqian and avoiding a disastrous end to their business trip was a stroke of luck, thanks in large part to Gao Di.

After the banquet, Liu San had taken Shucui back to his room. There was a certain charm in the disrobing, and Shucui was eager to please. They were well-matched. After several rounds of spirited engagement, Liu San felt a wave of fatigue and was about to drift off to sleep when a knock came at the doorâ€”it was Gao Di.

"It's so late. Why aren't you asleep? What are you doing running around?" Liu San scolded, annoyed.

Gao Di glanced into the room before whispering, "Doctor Liu, the singing girl who came today is not from a proper background!"

To say someone was "not from a proper background" meant they were trouble. Liu San was instantly on alert. When it came to understanding the complexities of this era, a street-smart boy like Gao Di was far more experienced than they were.

"Wait here," Liu San said. He went back into the room and threw on a shirt. He wasn't worried about his money being stolen; his large funds and valuables were locked in the inn's safe. Even if Shucui was a thief, she could at most make off with some loose change.

"Where are you going, master?" Shucui asked, her fragrant shoulder exposed as she lay in bed.

"To take a bath, I'm burning up," Liu San replied casually. He stepped out of the room and carefully locked the door behind him.

The corridor was no place to talk, so Liu San led Gao Di to a corner.

"What's going on?"

"I went into the city today and heard some news. There have been several incidents recently where inn guests were drugged and then robbed. Because the culprits didn't follow the local custom of paying respects to the authorities, the county's constables have been investigating quietly. I heard that a Mandarin-speaking woman from out of town is a prime suspect. She's likely a lone operator; even the local gang leaders don't know who she is!"

"Wait, paying respects?"

"Yes, pickpockets, thieves, swindlers... no matter their trade, anyone trying to make a living in this county has to pay tribute to the head constable. Otherwise, they can't operate. They'll either be driven out or arrested and flogged, lucky to escape with their lives."

"So corrupt," Liu San muttered, though he knew this wasn't the time to discuss Ming dynasty politics. "This thief?"

Gao Di nodded. "I heard from the clerk that you gentlemen had called for singing girls. I overheard a clerk mention that one of them was an outsider who spoke Mandarin. Putting two and two together, I became suspicious. I asked around the inn and found out something was wrong."

"What, is Shucui the thief?"

"Shucui isn't a thief. She's registered with the inn and has paid her dues," Gao Di said, wiping sweat from his brow. "But the one who went to Manager Huang's room is not on the books."

"Call him Manager outside," Liu San corrected, frowning. "It's Qianqian?"

"Yes, this is Qianqian's first time doing business here. She came with Shucui, who said she was a new sister she'd taken in. The inn asked her to register, but Qianqian said she'd do it next time and got away without it."

Liu San nodded. This alone wasn't conclusive, but it confirmed that Shucui was likely not a major problem, while Qianqian was highly suspicious.

"You and Chen Tong, go watch Huang Tianyu's room!" Liu San ordered. "I'll talk to the manager and get their help to be on guard."

Gao Di's suspicions proved correct. In the dead of night, Qianqian emerged from the room with a large bundle and was immediately apprehended by the waiting men.

Though small and slender, Qianqian knew some martial arts. She initially knocked Gao Di and Chen Tong to the ground. It took the inn's security guard to finally subdue and tie her up. Even then, she didn't stop struggling, kicking and screaming, her shrieks piercing the night. Guests from other rooms came out to see what was happening. The guard had to put a rope around her throat to silence her.

"This is all our fault. Our security was lax, and we let a criminal in, frightening our esteemed guests," the manager said, bowing repeatedly. "As compensation, your bill will be waived. If your friend needs a doctor, all expenses will be covered by the inn. We will also host a banquet to help you calm your nerves..."

"We'll discuss that later." Since Qiwei was essentially a part of the transmigrators' enterprise, Liu San wasn't interested in assigning blame. "You can all leave for now. I want to question this thief properly."

Hearing that he intended to interrogate Qianqian, the manager frowned. "That might not be appropriate. Whether you release her or report her to the authorities is your decision, but holding a private trial..."

"Who's holding a private trial?" Liu San thought, *I'm not an S&M enthusiast trying to get my kicks.* "Don't worry, I just want to know what drug she used so I can treat my friend!" He paused. "If you're worried, you can stay and watch as a witness."

"Yes, yes," the manager reluctantly agreed. "Please, ask what you will. I won't interfere. Just let us know whether to release her or report her, and we will do as you say."

He had the clerks clear the leftover food and wine from the table and put Huang Tianyu's belongings back in order. Liu San wasn't sure what drug Qianqian had used, but it seemed to be some kind of plant-based anesthetic: the victim remained conscious but their limbs and tongue were numb. The standard Chinese medicine antidotes were licorice and mung beans, so he ordered someone to prepare a decoction. He also had a basin of well water brought and splashed it on Huang Tianyu's face. Seeing a slow response, he figured there was no serious danger and that he would recover on his own soon.

"He'll be fine," Qianqian said from the floor. "Anyone who takes the 'Elixir of Bliss' will recover in an hour at most. This young lady is merciful; I wouldn't take his life."

"You call this harmful poison the 'Elixir of Bliss'?" Liu San scoffed. "All medicines have toxic properties. An overdose, even if not fatal, could leave him disabled, ruining his life. If he has parents and children, the sin would be immense!"

"It's not that easy to die from. It's been used for hundreds of years! Besides, that's the name passed down from my ancestors, not one I came up with!"

"Your ancestors engaged in such wicked deeds and gave it such a pleasant name. They must have been truly shameless." Due to his profession, Liu San had a deep-seated hatred for those who used drugs to harm others.

"Hmph, you dare insult my ancestors? Just wait until my father beats the crap out of you!" the girl retorted, still defiant.

"Your father should be beating the piss out of you!" Liu San threatened. "But he's probably no better than you are. I'll do it for him..."

"You dare!" Seeing Liu San roll up his sleeves and scan the room, apparently looking for a weapon, Qianqian, being a young girl with little real-world experience, began to panic. Her bravado after being caught was just a front. Fearing a beating, she blurted out, "You'll regret it if you hit me."

"Oh? And why would I regret it?" Liu San was amused. "You're just a female thief. Even if I don't hit you, when we report you to the authorities, the magistrate will have your pants stripped off and give you twenty strokes of the cane..."

Now Qianqian was truly panicked, her face flushing red. "You can't bully me like this! What are you going to do with me?"

"Nothing much. We'll hand you over to the authorities." Liu San had made up his mind. Since the drug wasn't fatal, there was no reason to keep Qianqian. If he let her go, she might follow them and seek revenge, which would be troublesome. The best course of action was to have the inn report her in the morning. She would be locked up for a few days, and by then, they would be long gone. As for the hardship the girl would face in prison, that wasn't his concern. He had no pity to spare for someone like her.

"Hmph, you dare to report me?" Qianqian snorted, a look of indifference on her face. "You'll be the ones in trouble then." She seemed to have made a decision. "I didn't want to scare you, but since you're so clueless, you have only yourselves to blame." She wriggled her waist. "Tell Shucui to get a silk pouch from my blouse!"

Liu San gestured, and Shucui quickly went over, fumbled in Qianqian's blouse for a moment, and retrieved a small pouch.

Liu San was cautious. He squeezed the pouch before opening it. It felt hard and heavy, like a piece of metal. The drawstring closure seemed simple enough, with no hidden mechanisms. He gently pulled it open and took out a small, well-crafted bronze plaque. On it were two lines of inlaid gold characters in the Song script:

*Confidant of the Court*

*Pillar of the Frontier*

Liu San's mind went blank. He was petrified for a few seconds.

*Mamma mia, it's the Jinyiwei!*

Although Liu San's expertise was in Chinese medicine, not Ming history, he had seen several members of the transmigrator group wearing T-shirts with these eight characters printed on them around Bairen City. Everyone in the group knew what they meant.

How had they gotten mixed up with this secret police organization? Liu San cursed his luck. Yu E'shui had listed the Jinyiwei as a particularly dangerous official agency and had warned everyone to be extremely careful when entering yellow and red zones.

By now, the numbness in Huang Tianyu's body was fading, and he came over to look.

"My God!" he exclaimed.

"What? Scared now?" Qianqian said smugly. "Hurry up and untie me, then kowtow a dozen times, and I'll forgive you."

Huang Tianyu whispered nervously, "Liu San, what do we do? This is big trouble!"

"I know," Liu San nodded. The plaque was exquisitely made and unlikely to be a fake, though they had never seen a real one. If they had truly offended a member of the Jinyiwei, the consequences would be endless, not only endangering themselves and their mission but also affecting the entire transmigrator group... A murderous thought rose in Liu San's mindâ€”perhaps it would be better to kill her and silence her for good.
