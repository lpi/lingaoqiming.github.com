With no tiles or planks for the roof, Tian Jiujiu had to improvise, weaving a covering of branches and leaves. The finished latrine, with its lush, green roof, had a certain rustic, eco-park charm. It was, of course, completely vulnerable to the elements, but in the dry season of Lingao, it would have to do. The final touch was a pair of crudely painted signs: "Male" and "Female."

The members of the construction group gathered around their creation, a strange sense of pride welling within them. It was a humble, even pathetic structure, but it was the first building of their new world, a milestone in their grand enterprise. If the floating pier deserved a monument, surely this did as well.

Mei Wan, caught up in the moment, proposed a ribbon-cutting ceremony. "It's a project for the people's livelihood," he declared. "We should have a member of the Executive Committee officiate. It will make it seem grand, formal."

Tian Jiujiu, the latrine's creator, enthusiastically agreed. A call was made to the Executive Committee. "This concerns the most fundamental interests of the masses," Mei Wan announced into the phone. He then arranged for two militiamen to stand guard, to ensure the latrine remained pristine for the ceremony.

Ye Mengyan and Wei Aiwen, two young recruits bored from a long day of guard duty, were dispatched to the site. They arrived to find themselves standing guard at a toilet.

"What damn political task is this?" Wei Aiwen grumbled. "A toilet you can't even piss in? What's the point?"

"There's a ribbon-cutting ceremony," Mei Wan explained.

"A toilet is supposed to stink!" Wei Aiwen shot back. "Does the Executive Committee control when we shit and piss now? I'm going to take a leak."

"What are you arguing about?" Ye Mengyan interjected, his voice laced with teenage angst. "Guard duty is guard duty. Who cares where it is?"

"This little comrade has insight," Mei Wan said with a placating smile, promising them access to the "good-boy movies" in the engineering tent that night.

On the sterncastle, the members of the Executive Committee were engaged in their own game of hot potato. No one wanted to be the one to cut the ribbon at a latrine dedication. In the end, [Xiao Zishan][y001], as the man in charge of internal and civil affairs, was strong-armed into attending.

A large crowd had already gathered. It seemed a project of such practical value was indeed popular. But as [Xiao Zishan][y001] smiled and waved, he was met with a chorus of curses.

"What are you pretending for? You build a toilet and won't let us use it!"

"This is bureaucracy at its finest! We can't even take a piss until the leader shows up?"

"I need to take a shit!" someone wailed.

[Xiao Zishan][y001]'s face fell. Two guards with bayoneted SKS rifles were standing at attention in front of the latrine. It was a farce.

"Commissioner Xiao, look this way!" Ding Ding shouted from his perch atop an excavator, his DV camera rolling. The ceremony was a godsend for his fledgling newspaper. He had even recruited [Li Xiaolü][y156] and his own girlfriend, Panpan, to serve as ceremonial ribbon-cutting ladies, dressing them in ill-fitting cheongsams for the occasion.

The appearance of the curvaceous Panpan in a high-slit cheongsam immediately shifted the crowd's focus. The men who had been clamoring to use the toilet now jostled for a better view.

Ding Ding, ever the propagandist, filmed a series of interviews. Shao Zong, from the logging group, delivered a heartfelt speech, thanking the Executive Committee for their "timely and popular project." "In the past," he declared, "we had to relieve ourselves on the swaying deck, which was both dangerous and polluting. Now, the Committee has thought of what the masses think, and we are all deeply moved."

His speech was interrupted by a voice from the crowd. "Damn it, who said you could represent me?"

"Panpan, delete that last part," Ding Ding instructed.

The ribbon-cutting itself was a minor disaster. The "ribbon," a thick vine, proved surprisingly tough, and [Xiao Zishan][y001] struggled to cut it.

Before leaving, covered in sweat, he had a final thought. He instructed the engineering group to erect a large bulletin board at the entrance. The walkie-talkies might run out of battery, but everyone, eventually, had to come to the toilet.

In a clearing near the beacon tower, the camp's health station was already operational. Several large canvas tents served as the outpatient department. A Red Cross flag flew from a bamboo pole at the entrance.

The medical team was busy sorting supplies. They had already treated four cases of heatstroke, five of diarrhea, and two of upper respiratory tract infections.

"39.4 degrees," He Ma said, looking at a thermometer. He was tending to a young man who had caught a fever after sleeping on a lifeboat without a sleeping bag. "Send him to the infirmary on the ship."

"I'm more worried about what's to come," he said to Zhang Ziyi, another doctor. "Hainan is a hotbed of infectious diseases. Malaria, cholera, parasites..."

The team held a short meeting, and Shi Niaoren, an expert in infectious diseases, drafted a proposal for the Executive Committee: they needed to find traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, conserve their modern drugs, monitor the population for any signs of an outbreak, and enforce strict sanitation measures. The new world was a dangerous place, and their survival depended on it.
