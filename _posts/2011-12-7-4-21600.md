Not only had Fu Bu'er become a pioneer of new agriculture, but he had also unintentionally become a pioneer in rural finance. The amount of this loan exceeded the total of all other loans in Meiyang Village. Because the loan amount was unprecedentedly large and exceeded the quota granted by the Delong Bank, the director of the credit department, Wu Di, personally came to Meiyang Village to investigate the situation before finally approving the agricultural loan.

A courtyard house built at such a great cost was naturally extraordinary—it was a real eye-opener for the local people, who had never seen such a reasonably laid out, convenient, and comfortable house.

Following Wanli Hui's guidance, Fu Bu'er's wife planted pumpkins in the backyard, with the trellises extending up to the roof, which not only made full use of the sunlight but also saved land. The Fu family had always raised ducks. Wanli Hui taught her to use the composted duck manure to raise earthworms in the backyard—the earthworm stock was provided by Wanli Hui. The finished earthworms were collected by the Heaven and Earth Society. Sometimes, the Fu family's mistress even felt that the Heaven and Earth Society was a bit "stupid." They would spend money to buy many useless things, and earthworms were one of them, along with chicken and duck feathers, bones, eggshells, and the like. She didn't know that the special feed she bought to make the ducks lay more eggs was made from these "useless" things.

In the front yard, she planted a few fruit trees and raised more than fifty laying hens. The chicken coop and the chicken run were built under the guidance of an agricultural technician. A trellis was also built over the run, also for growing pumpkins—pumpkins served not only as vegetables and coarse grains but also as a good source of feed.

The chicken manure was fermented and used to feed the pigs. The Fu family raised more than a dozen "Australian pigs," provided by the farm's breeding stock farm. The Heaven and Earth Society, following the model of the "small poultry loans," also issued "pig and sheep loans," lending piglets and lambs to farmers to raise. Of course, the Fu family didn't need such a low-level loan—he bought them directly with money. In addition to pigs, the Heaven and Earth Society also encouraged everyone to raise sheep, given the abundance of wasteland and wild grass in the area. The Fu family also raised about ten sheep.

The pig and sheep manure, along with the remaining residue from the entire courtyard's economic cycle, was all thrown into their own biogas digester. The digester also received the Fu family's own waste, becoming a source of fuel and fertilizer. The Fu family was the first in Meiyang Village to use biogas for cooking. This was so surprising that even the well-traveled Fu Fu and Fu Xi were amazed when they saw it for the first time.

Fu Fu walked into the spacious and bright living room, looking at the glass-paned windows, and thought to himself, "The master has really made it!" He had never seen local people enjoy such luxuries, except for a few wealthy business owners in East Gate Market.

The furniture in the living room was of the so-called "Australian" style—a style that was becoming popular locally and even in Guangdong. The rattan sofa chairs and coffee table, bought from the rattan and woodwork shop in East Gate Market, were well-suited to Lin'gao's warm climate. Since it was winter now, they were covered with cotton cushions. The floor was no longer dirt but paved with square bricks. Fu Bu'er had also pretentiously bought a woodblock color print of the "Sunrise on the Holy Ship" from East Gate Market and had it mounted in an exquisite frame. In the middle of the living room was a four-panel screen, on which was pasted a set of four vertical scroll-style color woodblock propaganda posters: "Officers and Soldiers of the Fubo Army." The images depicted soldiers from the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as an Elder officer.

Whether soldier or officer, they were all depicted with thick eyebrows, big eyes, and muscular builds. One held a rifle with a bayonet fixed, another held a cannonball, while the Elder officer held a command sword, gesturing to lead the soldiers forward. Below were different slogans and catchphrases, all printed in red.

These propaganda posters were being produced in small batches by the printing house as part of their political propaganda. The new, colorful posters were cheap, and the paper quality and printing were good. They quickly captured a large part of the market for traditional New Year pictures that flowed in from Guangdong. Families like Fu Bu'er's, in particular, were more willing to display such "new New Year pictures" to express their unusual relationship with the Australians.

There was no one at home; everyone was out working. Fu Yijin first brought Fu Fu water to wash his face, while Fu Xi hurried to make tea—the habit of drinking tea was gradually taking root in the Fu Bu'er household.

Fu Fu unbuckled his cartridge belt and put down his luggage, feeling a sense of relief. When Fu Yijin brought him the wash water, he became a little shy and said in a low voice, "Thank you, Sister Yijin." He took out a towel from his bag, and their hands touched, intentionally or not. Fu Fu mustered his courage and squeezed her hand.

Fu Yijin gave him a reproachful look. Fu Fu grew bolder. He had been in the army for over two years, well-fed and well-drilled, and had developed a strong physique. As a young man, his physiological needs were strong. They had been suppressed by strict discipline and constant drills and labor, but now that all that was gone, these needs immediately surfaced.

He boldly wrapped his arm around Fu Yijin's waist. "Sister Yijin!" he called out, his hands beginning to roam over her body. This startled Fu Yijin. It was broad daylight at home, her parents and siblings could come back at any time, and Fu Xi was outside boiling water. If they were caught, it would be a huge scandal.

She quickly pushed Fu Fu's hands away. "Are you trying to get yourself killed!" she said, pulling at her clothes. "What if someone sees?!"

"Sister Yijin—"

"If you're like this, I don't dare to be alone with you anymore," Fu Yijin said, putting on a "maidenly" air of reserve. "What do you take me for..."

Fu Fu was just about to express his "sincere" feelings when he heard Fu Xi's footsteps approaching from outside. He had no choice but to let go and sit down awkwardly, wondering how he would bring up the matter with the master later.

Fu Xi brought in the tea, seemingly unaware of the strange atmosphere between the two. Fu Yijin took out some dried sweet potato slices from the cupboard to serve Fu Fu.

"I don't dare to eat," Fu Fu said jokingly to cover his embarrassment. "The master's wife hasn't agreed yet."

"It's fine, she doesn't care about these little things anymore," Fu Xi said nonchalantly. "You can't get rich by saving money. The master's wife understands that now."

Fu Fu's return to the village caused a small commotion. A household servant who had been tied up and sent off to be a soldier had now returned as an imposing military man. The news spread like wildfire through the village. Fu Fu had only eaten a few bites of sweet potato when a hundred or so villagers gathered in Fu Bu'er's front yard. Some were there to watch the spectacle, some to hear the news, and some had heard that the treatment for soldiers was good and wanted to join the army. The entrance to the living room was packed, even more lively than when Wanli Hui first came to the village.

When everyone saw what had become of Fu Bu'er's former household servant, they all clicked their tongues in amazement. They all said that the Australians truly had the Midas touch. Whether it was things or people, after being handled by them, they all became radiant. In the past, Fu Fu was as thin as a monkey, dark and dry, clumsy at work, and mumbled when he spoke. Now, not only was he well-built and handsome, but he also spoke with a strong and clear voice. Just his fluency in the "New Language" put everyone's local dialect to shame.

The villagers were most interested in the recent war. The county-wide war preparations had also affected Meiyang Village. Some of the village militia had been mobilized to build roads and transport supplies in Bopu, but they had not directly participated in the fighting. The closest they got to the front line was guarding prisoners in Ma'niao. The militia's stories after their return were not enough to satisfy everyone's curiosity. Later, although the village office received a "special edition" of the *Lin'gao Times* about the great victory at Chengmai, and an agricultural technician had read it out to them, everyone still felt it wasn't enough. The content of the special edition was too brief, with only a simple account of the process and the result. The people wanted to hear lively, storyteller-like news.

Fu Fu, as a soldier of the 1st Infantry Battalion, had directly participated in the Battle of Chengmai and a series of other campaigns. He had seen and heard a lot, so he certainly had plenty to talk about. Now that there was an audience, he began to tell his stories like a storyteller. From the march to the battle under the walls of Chengmai, to the pursuit all the way to Qiongshan. He talked about everything: the infantry square fighting the cavalry, the naval ships firing rockets to burn down Chengmai County town, the rout of tens of thousands of government troops. He even bragged about the naval battle at Baisha Water Fortress, which he hadn't even participated in. The villagers listened with great relish.

Then someone asked about being a soldier. Fu Fu bragged a lot—people tend to embellish their own situation. He boasted about the three meals a day, with meat at every meal; the sights he had seen while marching and fighting in various places. His stories made the local young men's hearts itch, and they all wanted to go out and be soldiers to see the world. As for the training and the labor support, no one paid much attention. They had to work hard and suffer at home doing farm work anyway. A few of them immediately asked about the requirements for joining the army and how to sign up.

As everyone was chattering away, Fu Bu'er returned with Wanli Hui. Because Fu Bu'er had become a "model," Meiyang Village was one of the few villages that still frequently received direct guidance from an Elder agricultural technician. Most of the Heaven and Earth Society's clients could now only receive guidance from naturalized technicians, and only complex and important issues would be handled by an Elder.

Wanli Hui didn't mind coming to Meiyang Village often. Since the Fu family had rebuilt their house, the living conditions were much better than before, almost reaching the standard of East Gate Market. There were also lovely girls to serve him. Staying here for a few days to provide technical guidance was a very enjoyable experience. On this trip to the countryside, he was, on the one hand, promoting the cultivation of winter wheat, and on the other hand, guiding the farmers in developing courtyard economies and promoting "planting on the ten edges"—especially using various vacant plots to plant castor and flax. Both of these crops were urgently needed oil sources for the current Lin'gao industrial system.
