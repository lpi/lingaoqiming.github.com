Of course, Xuan De was no upright official, and Ma Weisan knew it. Xuan De's motivation for joining the sect was no different from his own. The higher one climbed, the thinner the faith and the greater the consideration for personal gain. This was a tacit understanding among the upper echelons.

Hearing Ma Weisan's "tactful" offer, Xuan De was quite pleased. However, the Yizhou affair had already sent shockwaves through the main headquarters and couldn't just be brushed aside. Moreover, Yizhou's annual contribution of 4,800 taels of silver was a significant source of income for the sect. Losing it would have a major impact. In Shandong, competition among the various folk religions was fierce. Territory brought wealth, and wealth expanded territory; the two were intertwined.

On the way to Yizhou, Xuan De had already considered his options thoroughly. Eliminating Ma Weisan was one choice, but the situation in Yizhou was unstable. He still needed to use Ma Weisan's influence—after all, the Yizhou area was his power base, built over many years and deeply rooted. If pushed to the brink, Ma Weisan might defect to the Daoist Zhang, which would create a much more difficult situation.

A fleeting smile crossed his face. Ma Weisan caught it instantly, his spirits lifting. He quickly added, "Law Master, if there is anything your disciple can do to serve you during your visit to Yizhou, I will do so with the loyalty of a dog or a horse."

"At least you have some self-awareness." Xuan De sneered and stood up. "I might as well tell you: the matter of Yizhou has already alarmed the Sect Master and the Saintess of the main altar. How do you think this should be handled?"

"Yes, yes, for alarming Your Holiness, your disciple deserves ten thousand deaths!" Hearing that the Sect Master and the Saintess had been disturbed, a wave of fear once again washed over Ma Weisan. It was said that the Saintess could command ghosts with her spirit, steal souls, and control living people like puppets. The terrifying legends were endless.

His legs went weak, and he immediately fell to his knees. "Your disciple is willing to serve with utmost sincerity!"

In the end, Ma Weisan agreed to "contribute" an additional ten thousand taels of incense money to the main headquarters. Seeing his tact, Xuan De felt that this ten thousand taels would be a good account to give back at the main headquarters, and his tone softened slightly.

"Since you are so sincere, I will give you a way out."

Ma Weisan was overjoyed and kowtowed hastily. "Thank you for your great kindness, Law Master."

"You don't have to thank me," Xuan De said coldly. "Life and death, honor and disgrace, you must fight for them yourself. Otherwise, even I cannot save you."

"Yes, yes, your disciple will certainly do his utmost!"

"Get up first," Xuan De said. "Tell me honestly, what is the real situation in Yizhou now? Don't hide anything!"

Ma Weisan immediately described the current situation in Yizhou and had someone fetch the register of incense halls. With a brush, he marked the halls he could still control, those that had rebelled, and those whose allegiance was unclear.

Less than a third had completely rebelled. Xuan De thought to himself: *This is still salvageable.*

"What a waste," he secretly despised Ma Weisan. To have these resources and not use them, instead hiding like a coward. No matter how formidable the Daoist Zhang was, he was still just one man.

*This Yizhou sub-altar should be handed over to a more capable and reliable person in the future.*

But how to proceed was a matter he needed to discuss with others. Those who came with him were all key figures from the main headquarters and had to be shown sufficient respect. However, this was purely a matter of courtesy. Hu Qi'er's failure had brought him a secret sense of satisfaction. Her master was none other than the Inner Law Hall's Saintess, who had accompanied him this time.

Dealing with Hu Qi'er was within his authority. By holding her fate in his hands, he was confident he could make this arrogant woman bow her head and never dare to oppose him again. At this thought, a cruel smile appeared on his lips. He ordered his subordinate, "Take the criminal Hu Qi'er to the torture chamber in the rear courtyard. I will conduct a night interrogation!"

Ma Weisan's study in the sub-altar compound was his nerve center. It not only stored a large number of confidential documents and correspondence but was also furnished with the utmost luxury and comfort.

Now, it had become Xuan De's lodging. After offering the gold, Ma Weisan had tactfully sent word to his steward to send two beautiful and seductive maids to serve Xuan De.

Although Xuan De held a high position, he was usually at the main headquarters and had to act with some restraint. Now that he was in the provinces and being flattered, he was enjoying himself with abandon.

One day, as he was drinking and making merry with the two women, a commotion erupted outside. It seemed someone was trying to force their way into the study and was arguing with the guards. Xuan De, as if expecting it, waved the maids away.

With a bang, the door was thrown open. A woman in her thirties stormed in, furious. It was Luo Saichun, the Saintess of the Inner Law Hall, who had come with him to clean up the mess in Yizhou.

Xuan De smiled. "So it is Saintess Luo. What urgent matter brings you to see me in such a hurry?"

Luo Saichun gave a cold smile and waved her hand behind her. "All of you, leave. I have a few words to say to Law Master Xuan."

Xuan De glanced at the people who had followed her in and nodded calmly. "Alright, you may all leave for now!"

"Sit," he gestured to Luo Saichun.

"No need," Luo Saichun said coldly. "Have you interrogated Ma Weisan and Hu Qi'er already?"

"That's right, I asked them a few questions," Xuan De admitted readily. "What, am I not allowed to ask?"

"You are the Law Master of the Inner Hall; it is within your authority," Luo Saichun said. "But why did you torture Hu Qi'er without distinguishing right from wrong? And why are you keeping her in the torture chamber? Isn't she still under the sentence of 'facing the wall and awaiting punishment'?"

"She has committed such a grave crime. A few lashes in the torture chamber is a light punishment," Xuan De sneered. "Saintess Luo, I know you are eager to protect your disciple, but don't forget, she failed in her mission and fled in the face of the enemy. By rights, I could hold a ceremony right now and execute her by the 'Heavenly Fire' punishment, and it wouldn't be excessive. I have already shown great leniency for your sake."

Luo Saichun was clearly not buying his threats. She stuck out her neck and said, "As for the eight words 'failed in her mission and fled in the face of the enemy,' let's not even talk about whether you have any evidence. Ma Weisan, as the Altar Master, has let the Yizhou sub-altar fall into chaos. Does he not deserve the 'Heavenly Fire' punishment?"

"I know better than you what punishment Altar Master Ma deserves," Xuan De said. "However, to restore order in Yizhou now, I must rely on him. It is not out of line to treat him with some leniency. Don't forget, when we set out, the Grand Altar Master granted me the authority to 'act as I see fit.' Are you going to defy the Grand Altar Master's command?"

"You're talking nonsense! Don't use the Grand Altar Master's name to pressure me!" Luo Saichun came from a background of street performers and had a straightforward personality. "You've had your eyes on Hu Qi'er for a long time. After failing to seduce her repeatedly, you're now just taking revenge! You despicable, shameless villain!"

"Nonsense!" Xuan De slammed his hand on the table and stood up, saying proudly, "I am an upstanding man who stands between heaven and earth. My actions can be judged by the sun and moon. It is not for a woman from your lowly,贱业, profession to speak such drivel!"

Luo Saichun had been a rope-walking performer—a very low-status profession even among the lower-class members of the sect. She had been looked down upon for a long time. Later, she had climbed her way up to a high position, but she was still secretly despised.

Xuan De's words made her tremble with rage, but in terms of sect status, martial arts, and magical abilities, Xuan De was superior to her. Although the title of Saintess was prominent and highly respected among ordinary members, it held no real power within the sect's upper echelons.

If a conflict were to break out, both sides would suffer, but the damage to her would be far greater than to Xuan De. It would not only fail to help the situation but would also push the already suffering Hu Qi'er deeper into misery.

Thinking of this, Luo Saichun forced herself to calm down. "Fine. What do you want?"

"Saintess Luo, I believe you should at least know a little about hierarchy and respect before we can talk," Xuan De said with a cruel smile. "Otherwise, I have nothing to discuss with you."

Luo Saichun had to swallow her anger. "Fine. Please, Law Master, instruct me on what you intend to do."

"That's more like it." Xuan De didn't want to humiliate her too much either; after all, Luo Saichun was one of the sect's high-ranking members.

"Saintess Luo," he said slowly, "the matter of Hu Qi'er can be big or small. It all depends on you, her master."

"Speak your mind. But if it concerns her honor and innocence, don't expect me to help a tyrant do evil!" Luo Saichun gritted her teeth. "I would rather she die a clean death."

"Hmph, what do you take me for?" Xuan De sneered. "A few fleshly vessels, I don't even care for them." He continued, "You just need to remember to be careful with your words from now on."

Luo Saichun understood. This old man was probably up to some shady business again. She was a very intelligent woman and immediately guessed it must involve the Yizhou sub-altar and the Ma family's wealth—Xuan De was likely planning to embezzle. He was using Hu Qi'er to blackmail her into silence.

"Fine, I promise you," she gritted her teeth and nodded. "But Hu Qi'er must be released immediately!"

In the following days, Xuan De did indeed release Hu Qi'er and Ma Weisan, ordering them to confess their mistakes before the incense hall and then "await orders while atoning for their crimes."

Xuan De was pleased with his own calculations and had a plan for restoring order in Yizhou. He then presented his solution.

First, a decree from the main altar would be sent to all incense halls, whether they had rebelled or were still wavering. It would announce the arrival of representatives from the main headquarters and that a ceremony would be held on a chosen day. All local incense masters, incense attendants, and incense leaders were ordered to attend the grand ceremony to display the sect's power.

Anyone who came would be granted a "pardon for past offenses." As for those who refused, a few would be executed by "the law" to serve as a warning. With Ma Weisan's local influence and the strength of the emissaries from the main headquarters, Xuan De believed it would not be difficult to compel the majority of the local sub-altar's key members to attend. As for the rebellious incense halls, even if they stubbornly refused to come, they would surely be thrown into a state of panic.
