After the jet ski was lowered into the water, it caused a stir among the guests. Qian Duoduo, of course, couldn't ride the jet ski alone. There were many people here with experience driving jet skis. Lin Shenhe immediately announced that he had caught a cold and was not suitable for going into the water.

Xue Ziliang, eager to take Sarina out to sea, volunteered to drive the jet ski. He first took the two little girls out for a spin, performing a few tricks that drew screams from the children. After showing off enough, he brought the boat back. Then, he naturally wanted to take Sarina out to sea, but Sarina firmly refused, saying she didn't want to get her clothes wet. She only had a few decent outfits, and if they got wet, she would have to wear the shapeless uniform. Disappointed, Xue Ziliang had to hand over the jet ski to others.

Panpan really wanted to play but didn't dare to go alone, so she set her sights on Bei Wei. Bei Wei was really unwilling to be squeezed together with this enthusiastic foreign girl, and this jet ski with its suspicious gasoline source could become a stain on his record. He declined, and despite the clamor of the crowd, even their taunts of "not being a man," he insisted on not sitting with Panpan. In the end, it was Xue Ziliang who once again sat behind Panpan.

Xue Ziliang was certainly no gentleman. There were no other handholds on the jet ski, so to avoid falling into the water, he could only hold Panpan's waist tightly. And Panpan seemed to be deliberately teasing this banana warrior, constantly accelerating and decelerating, changing direction, causing Xue Vinnie to lurch forward uncontrollably. Holding a beautiful woman in his arms had already made the tough guy's heart race, and the physical contact made him have an undesirable reaction. But she was already spoken for, and several people were watching with ill intentions and jeering. On a normal day, Xue Ziliang would certainly have been a "gentleman baring his balls," but at this moment, Sarina was on the deck, watching with a cocktail. Although foreign girls were not very concerned about such matters between men and women, he still wanted to give her the impression of being devoted. He immediately asked to go back. Panpan did not give up, just stopping the jet ski at a distance and swapping places with Xue Ziliang.

After swapping places, Xue Ziliang enjoyed another round. With the heat from behind and the constant impact of the rolling waves, his inevitable physiological reaction became more severe. To avoid embarrassing himself in front of Sarina, Xue Ziliang had to pretend to slip while climbing onto the yacht, fall into the water to cool off, and then climb back onto the deck.

The deck erupted with screams and laughter. Zheng Shangjie quickly handed him a glass of fruit juice-laced soda to cover up the awkward situation. At this time, Minister Shi announced his departure. He still had a class to teach to the native medical staff, and no matter how much everyone tried to persuade him to stay, he had to go back to work.

Ai Beibei was a little worried about whether it was appropriate to be so ostentatiously riding a jet ski around. It was a holiday, and many elders would be active in the vicinity. If they were seen, envy, jealousy, and hatred would erupt in the form of public opinion, and no matter how they explained that the gasoline was siphoned from the fuel tank, it would be useless. So she had everyone put the jet ski away and had the yacht head towards the jetty to drop off Shi Niaoren.

The sea was still a bit chilly this season. After eating and drinking, everyone felt the sea breeze was a bit strong, so they decided to anchor the boat in the bay to eat, drink, and swim.

The sailboat anchored 2 kilometers from the shore, and everyone began the next activity. Those who had brought swimsuits changed and prepared to go into the water. The seawater at Lingao Cape was very clear. This bay had been renovated to serve as a bathing beach, with a breakwater built and shark nets installed at the entrances to the sea.

The few ladies did not go into the sea. After changing into their swimsuits, they went to soak in the hot tub on the bow. Mendoza wore her bikiniâ€”it was the only clothing she had when she was tricked onto the boat. Her other clothes were either issued by the group or made with the help of the two Qian wives.

Sarina wore an extra swimsuit of Zheng Shangjie's, which could only be said to be barely wearable. The exposed spring scenery was hard to resist. The men, afraid of an uncontrollable embarrassment, either went for a swim in the bay or decided to first tour the North American gang's private arsenal and then play with some guns.

The few men went down to the cabin, first taking a quick look around, and then came to the bilge. This had been simply partitioned and was now a reloading workshop. The vibrating pot for cleaning shell casings, the automatic powder dispenser, and the tools for resizing casings and seating bullets were all fixed to vises. The de-priming tools and a precision scale were also set aside.

These items had been lent out for a while not long ago for the mechanical group to replicate. After all, professional equipment was much more professional than the homemade tools brought by the illegal gunsmith Li Yiwo. After the replication was finished, the Ministry of Science and Technology purchased a set for STC storage, and the rest was returned to them, along with a set of locally made replicas.

The few North American guests already had two basic sets of reloading tools. Before the transmigration, they had upgraded their equipment, equipping themselves with reloading dies for almost all common calibers, and a large number of various bullets, primers, and powder. In total, they could reload tens of thousands of rounds of various ammunition, mostly in calibers other than the group's standard issue.

These few people already had many guns of various calibers. In preparation for the transmigration, they had also adjusted their collections, getting rid of a batch of flashy but impractical pieces and adding more powerful, durable guns with large magazine capacities. Besides buying from various normal channels, Zhou Weisen had also bought many good things from the collections of his gun friends.

After looking at the reloading workshop, the few of them began to select the guns they wanted to try from the gun cabinet, which had been converted from a storage room, and various boxes. Bei Wei opened a wooden box filled with Smith & Wesson .44 caliber guns. Besides three S&W large revolvers, there was also a Marlin lever-action and a Ruger semi-automatic carbine. This caliber of ammunition was once called the most powerful handgun round. Those large revolvers were officially recognized bear-hunting weapons. The size of the casing and the weight of the bullet were clearly not on the same level as a typical 9mm.

Xue Ziliang opened a gun cabinet and whistled. It was full of various .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles, including a SCAR, a SIG556, and various American-made civilian ARs. Besides the standard iron sights, many were equipped with red dot sights for close combat, and there were also two ACOGs.

He picked up a short-barreled AR and asked, "Do you have a Class 3 license? No? That's a federal felony, ten years for each offense."

"Then we'd all have to serve several life sentences," Zhou Weisen said with a smile.

According to US gun laws, assault rifles with a barrel length of less than 16 inches were classified as restricted weapons. Arms manufacturers had developed a class of short-barreled assault weapons without a stock, called assault pistols (AR PISTOL), to circumvent this restriction. These two short-barreled assault rifles had normal folding stocks and clearly could not be considered ordinary assault pistols. Qian Shuixie smiled, opened another cabinet, and said, "Sir, we have some more things here, but they were all made after D-Day."

The box contained a GALIL, an FN FAL, and an AK, all high-quality civilian or military surplus weapons. Besides magazines, they were also equipped with drum magazines or belt-fed systems.

After inspecting them, Xue Ziliang looked at the few North American gun enthusiasts. "You've converted them all to full-auto?"

"Yeah, ten years for each. How many years should we serve?"

"That's for the judge to decide," Xue Ziliang said, shouldering the gun several times. It felt very comfortable. He had many complaints about the SKS rifle. "The Special Reconnaissance Team should be equipped with these to look the part."

"There's more," Zhou Weisen took out a few tubes from a box. "Equipped with a knock-off silencer. It works okay. It can reduce the noise of an AR-type weapon to the level of a .22LR."

Bei Wei was dazzled. He had probably fired the most bullets among the elders, but he had had very limited contact with different types of light weapons, basically only the standard issue weapons of the army. He had only had limited contact with foreign military weapons. Most he had only seen in pictures in the internal materials compiled by the military region's intelligence department. Now he felt he couldn't take it all in. His eyes swept over a cabinet on the side and he was surprised. "You have machine guns too?!"

In a cabinet in the corner of the cabin stood two M1919A6 machine guns, their sturdy tripods also folded and standing together.

"According to American law, this is considered a semi-automatic rifle, .308 caliber. There are two more underneath that haven't been converted to full-auto yet," Qian Shuiting replied. "This thing with the tripod only costs two thousand dollars, cheaper than a good AR."

"What kind of rifle is this? It looks like a bolt-action," Bei Wei had discovered a new continent. On a gun rack were several rifles and ammunition boxes he had never seen before, all locked up.

"This is a K31 rifle."

Bei Wei had never seen a K31 rifle before. At first glance, it felt very unfamiliar. In fact, he had had almost no contact with any bolt-action rifle. He took one and handled it. This gun was clearly a well-made killing machine.

Xue Ziliang said, "This is good stuff. A Swiss-made straight-pull bolt-action rifle with a detachable magazine. The accuracy of a standard issue rifle for a common soldier can often reach 1 MOA."

They then talked about how when they first arrived and were attacked by pirates, most of their arms were in sealed boxes in the bilge. Besides the Mosin-Nagant that Qian Shuixie carried with him all day, they could only take out a few bolt-action K31s in a hurry.

"Yeah, we put cheap scopes on them to use as sniper rifles. Everyone knew Qian Shuixie usually liked to use his knock-off Mosin sniper rifle, so they thought these were all Mosin-Nagants."

"Speaking of Mosin-Nagants, we also brought some. The biggest feature of this thing is that it's cheap. Both the gun and the ammunition are cheap. If it weren't for the limited tonnage of the *Feiyun*, if we had brought three thousand of them to form a regiment, we would have swept the world by now," Qian Shuixie said with some regret. He handed a Mosin to Bei Wei.

This was the first time Bei Wei had held this famous rifle in his hands. In the past, he had only seen this weapon, which frequently appeared in modern Chinese history, once in the warehouse of the People's Armed Forces Department, among a pile of various rifles chained to a gun cabinet.
