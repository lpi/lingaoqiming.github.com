"That's the Xuanzhu," Ran Yao said, his voice low, gesturing through the bamboo curtain at a flower boat moored by the embankment.

Lin Shenhe raised his binoculars, the focus wheel turning smoothly under his fingers. The sky was dimming, the light soft and even. It was perfect.

They occupied a private room on the third and highest floor of a restaurant overlooking White Goose Pool, secured the day before by the escort agency. From this vantage point, Ran Yao and Bei Wei had conducted a full day of observation, mapping out the entire scene.

The kidnappers had chosen their lair well. The Hezi Embankment was the outermost pier, and the Xuanzhu was tied at its very end. A single push of an oar would send them into the broad expanse of the Pearl River. It was a location that offered easy access, discretion, and a swift escape.

Their reconnaissance had also identified two additional lookouts: one on a small congee boat at the adjacent pier, the other a medicine seller on the shore. On the flower boat itself, they had confirmed two guardsâ€”one stationed on the high stern, the other, the bouncer, patrolling the deck.

Lin Shenhe panned his binoculars across the scene, calculating the distance. From his perch to the end of the embankment was roughly one hundred meters. The Xuanzhu sat apart from the other flower boats, a deliberate isolation that, while intended for security, now gave him an unobstructed line of sight.

*Is [Director Wen][y002] truly on that boat?* he mused. *Is he being entertained, or is he being tormented?* The thought was a disquieting one.

He mentally cataloged his targets. They were all lean, dark men, like nearly everyone he'd seen in this era. The assault team had memorized their faces from photographs. Even the women on the boat were considered potential combatants. Bei Wei had been clear: any hostile action was to be met with decisive force.

*What quarrel do I have with them?* The thought was an unwelcome intrusion. They were strangers, just as [Director Wen][y002] was a stranger. He shook his head, pushing the thought away. In this new world, their small group's survival was paramount. Anyone who threatened it had to be neutralized.

He confirmed the position of each target, then dragged a table to the window, placing a modified pillow on it. A prone position offered the best stability.

"Fire when you hear the firecrackers," Ran Yao reminded him, then slipped out of the room. Lin checked his watch: 17:20.

He removed his helmet and cloak, the layers of cloth a potential interference. Settling onto the table, he aimed the rifle, his body a stable platform. Ran Yao had designated the first target: the medicine seller at the entrance to the embankment.

The man's head filled the scope. Lin steadied his breathing, his focus absolute. A first-shot hit at one hundred meters with an unfamiliar rifle demanded nothing less. "Lin Shenhe, ready," he whispered into his walkie-talkie.

Bei Wei's team, hidden in a small rowboat, waited on the water. [Xiao Zishan][y001] was with the support team and the getaway carts a short distance away. As the "ready" confirmations crackled over the radio, a profound silence seemed to settle over the world.

The sudden eruption of firecrackers shattered the quiet. Lin Shenhe's finger tightened on the trigger. The first shot kicked up a puff of dust just beside the target. Without conscious thought, he cycled the action and fired again. The medicine seller crumpled to the ground.

Through his scope, he saw Ran Yao charging toward the flower boat, a phantom in a black cloak, his modern camouflage and helmet a surreal slash of color against the classical backdrop of the riverfront. The image would be seared into his memory for years to come.

Ran Yao knew Lin's next target was the congee seller. The man on the boat, untouched by the first volley, grinned and produced three small knives. On pure instinct, Ran Yao raised his shotgun. The muzzle flash was a blinding roar. The knife-thrower was thrown backward into the water, his red-ribboned blades clattering on the deck.

Screams tore through the air as the few people on the embankment scattered, diving for cover or throwing themselves to the ground.

Lin Shenhe had already shifted his aim. The archer on the stern was his next priority. He had seen the man reach for a bow. Two quick shots, and the threat was eliminated.

The bouncer on the deck saw the two black-clad figures bearing down on him and shouted an alarm, drawing an iron ruler as he backed toward the cabin. Just as Ran Yao took aim, a shot rang out from the restaurant window, and the man fell back into the cabin.

Ran Yao stormed aboard, finding several women huddled on the floor, speechless with terror. He ignored them, turning his attention to the central cabin. The curtain moved. He and his teammate fired in unison, the cabin filling with the acrid smell of gunpowder. A large man, clutching a dagger, stumbled out with a cry.

"Brother Wang!" one of the prostitutes shrieked.

It was the ringleader, Boss Wang. Ran Yao felt a surge of relief. The main culprit was accounted for. He was about to press the search when Lin Shenhe's voice crackled over the radio: "Rescue [Director Wen][y002]! A small boat is getting away!"

From his high vantage point, Lin could see the skiff pulling away, but the rower was obscured by the flower boat itself.

Bei Wei, however, had a clear view from the water. He saw the movement and fired two shots at the boat's stern, eliciting a cry of pain.

"Row, quickly!" he yelled at the men from the escort agency.

As the two boats converged, Bei Wei leaped across the gap. A man burst from the skiff's cabin, slashing at him with a knife. On the rocking boat, Bei Wei was at a disadvantage in a blade fight. But he wasn't holding a blade. His finger tightened on the trigger of the five-shotgun. The blast was overwhelming at such close range, and the man's attack ended abruptly as he collapsed to the deck.

Bei Wei plunged into the tiny cabin. On a small bed lay [Director Wen][y002].

"Target neutralized!" Bei Wei shouted into his walkie-talkie. "[Director Wen][y002] is secure." He checked his vitals. He was breathing steadily, deep in an unnatural sleep. "He's safe."

"All teams, withdraw!" Ran Yao's voice commanded. "Check the cabin for our gear. Take what you can, dump the rest."

"What about you?"

"Recovering our items. I'll be right behind you. Meet at the rendezvous!"

Bei Wei directed his team to carry [Director Wen][y002] to their boat. He quickly searched the cabin, finding nothing but some cosmetics. On deck, he collected the spent shotgun shells and searched the fallen opponents, stowing any small items in a pouch at his waist before returning to his own boat.

From the first firecracker to the moment [Director Wen][y0oz2] was loaded onto the mule cart, the entire operation took just over four minutes. The meticulously planned assault had left the bandits no chance to react. As the cart pulled away, the string of firecrackers was still crackling, a string of celebratory pops for their first victory.
