Wu De polished off his seafood rice, filled his thermos, and headed out for guard duty. Today's assignment was Section 3 of the road construction site. He had heard that the Executive Committee leaders would be making an appearance, a "new measure" to implement the spirit of "everyone participates in labor to avoid cadre specialization." The number of guards had been doubled.

He found them easily enough. Ding Ding, the ever-present photographer, was perched on a bulldozer, directing everyone to pose while his foreign girlfriend snapped pictures. [Ma Qianzhu][y005] and a few other committee members, their smiles stiff, held folding entrenching tools and pretended to dig.

*Damn,* Wu De thought, *this scene is so familiar.*

After the reporters had gone, the committee members continued to dig, though with less enthusiasm. They didn't immediately hop in a car and leave, nor did they shake hands with any model workers. It seemed Little Ding's propaganda skills were still a bit rusty.

"Hey, who are you digging a pit for?" Wu De called out.

"To bury an idler like you," Old Ma retorted, not looking up. "I'm building a road."

"Building a road? Looks like you're digging a pit to me."

"Digging a pit? I have a strong sense of public morality, unlike some people." [Ma Qianzhu][y005] swung his shovel and shouted at Ye Mengyan, who was working nearby. "What are you doing? We're taking earth, not digging a well! You're going to hurt someone!"

"Haha... By the way," Wu De said, pointing at the shovel in Old Ma's hand, "that thing is for fooling kids who've never seen a farm. I have a two-pronged mountain hoe. Put a handle on it, and you'll have a real tool."

"Why don't you go get it, then? No foresight..." [Ma Qianzhu][y005] grumbled, raising his shovel in a mock threat.

Wu De returned to his shed and gathered his own tools: hoes, shovels, picks, bamboo knives, and axes. He fitted handles to a few of them, driving in wooden wedges to secure them, and brought a hoe back to [Ma Qianzhu][y005].

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] spat on his hands, swung the hoe in a wide arc, and brought it down. The hoe head flew off, and he tumbled backward into the pit, still clutching the handle.

"Hahaha... a fake migrant worker! Let's see your temporary residence permit," Wu De teased.

"Stop talking and pull me up," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] growled.

"Alright, alright, no more jokes." Seeing that Committee Member Ma was genuinely angry, Wu De jumped into the pit, fixed the hoe, and showed him how to use the ancient tool.

"What did you eat yesterday?" he asked, shoveling the earth [Ma Qianzhu][y005] had loosened. He was on guard duty, but a little work in front of the leader couldn't hurt.

"Don't ask. Dry rations and kelp soup. What about you? I haven't seen you at the canteen."

"Seafood paella," Wu De said. "Live off the land, live off the sea. I've been catching fish and crabs, gathering shellfish. You want to join me? Bring your own rice."

"I wish. I'm swamped with work here. Not everyone is as carefree as you. By the way, the Executive Committee has a new task for you."

"A new task?" Wu De's heart sank. Had they heard about his kitchen exploits and decided to make him a cook?

The five captives, huddled in their holding pen, were convinced they were doomed. They were spies, and spies were executed. Even if the pirates were willing to accept a ransom, they were poor tenant farmers. They had no eighty-year-old mothers, no eight-year-old sons. They were all single men, lured by the promise of reward money. They had nothing to offer. They wept and wailed.

They were herded out of the pen and into the sunlight. The little leader who had interrogated them strutted over, clad in a suit of chain mail that gleamed in the sun. A few of the taller leaders stood beside him. The five men fell to their knees.

"Get up! Form a line!" the guard barked, whipping them with a thin stick.

Wu De looked at the five men. They were all dark and thin, classic examples of the malnourished working class of this era. The guard, Yuan Qiushi, was only eighteen, but he was a head taller and a circle wider than any of them. Modern children, he thought, were well-developed.

Since they were to be kept, a system of management had to be established. Human nature hadn't changed much in a few thousand years. The first step was to instill fear, to crush any thought of resistance. A drill sergeant's roar, a prison boss's show of forceâ€”the effect was the same.

He put on a stern expression and examined the men. Xiong Buyou, in his self-made chain mail, brandished a long sword borrowed from [Wen Zong][y002]. The five men trembled, one of them soiling himself.

Another pirate approached, dressed all in white. He had a scholarly face, but his long white robe gave him the air of the White Impermanence, a harbinger of death. His eyes darted over them, and they held their breath.

"Take off your clothes!" Wu De shouted. The captives, not understanding his Mandarin, stared at him, bewildered.

Xiong Buyou started to translate, but Wu De shook his head and nodded at Little Yuan. The young guard's stick fell, and the men cried out, clutching their heads.

Wu De waved his hand, and they were herded back into a line.

"Take off your clothes!"

This time, he gestured, pointing at their tattered garments. The smarter ones understood. They hesitated, wondering what these well-dressed pirates could possibly want with their rags. Little Yuan's stick came down again, and they stripped, shivering in the cool air.

"Dr. He, you can examine them now."

Since they would be working alongside the transmigrators, their hygiene was a matter of public health.

He Ma began his examination. As he had expected, they were infested with parasites and skin infections. It was no surprise, given their poor living conditions.

Under Wu De's command and Yuan Qiushi's ever-present stick, the men were made to bend over and spread their buttocks. *Are they going to rape us?* they thought in terror. *We're not as fair and tender as the young servants of the masters. These pirates have a strange taste, to have a group anal rape in broad daylight...*

He Ma, wearing a mask and latex gloves, found what he was looking for: the obvious eggs of intestinal parasites. Despite his mental preparation, he felt a wave of nausea.

All the captives had sores on their bodies and the bites of fleas and bedbugs. But they had no major illnesses. He examined their hair and found it teeming with head lice and nits. To his surprise, two of them had ticks firmly attached to their scalps, a rarity in the world they had left behind. Their teeth were covered in tartar, and they had the blue lines of malnutrition, but no cavities. They probably didn't get enough sugar for that. He Ma had been worried about leprosy or syphilis, but they seemed to be, in their own way, quite healthy.

"Let them bathe," He Ma said. "Nothing serious. They're very healthy."

"In the river?" Wu De asked. "What about schistosomiasis?"

"No, I've checked the medical records for Lingao. No mention of it. And we haven't found any snails in the water source."

"Get in the river and bathe!" Wu De's command caused a fresh wave of panic. The captives thought they were being driven into the river to be drowned. They refused to move, even under Little Yuan's stick. Xiong Buyou had to brandish his sword to force them into the water. The river was shallow, and the men flailed and sputtered, forced to submerge themselves repeatedly.

He Ma boiled their clothes in a large pot he had found in an abandoned house. It would have been better to burn them, but the transmigrators had no spare clothing for the local laborers. The textile industry was still just a plan on paper.

The men were pulled from the river and herded to a rock. Another figure in white approached, this one a woman, her face covered, a sharp knife in her hand. The captives, terrified, covered their groins. One of them fell at Wu De's feet, kowtowing and begging, saying he was the only son for three generations and would do anything, but he would not be made a eunuch.

The nurse, though not a barber, was skilled at shaving patients for surgery. Her scissors and razor flew, and in a few moments, the five men were bald.

Though they had not been taught that their bodies were a gift from their parents, they were still shocked and frightened by the sudden loss of their hair. One of them burst into tears, his sobs echoing in the quiet air. Even He Ma felt a pang of pity.
