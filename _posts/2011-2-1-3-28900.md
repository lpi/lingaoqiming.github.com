Lin Baiguang was very flexible with the activity funds for these two people. He wanted to see their attitude towards using the funds. Would they squander a large sum of money once they got their hands on it, or would they know how to use the money properly?

How to find a foothold, how to collect intelligence, and how to use activity funds were all taught in the training class. Whether they could apply what they had learned would be seen in this practical exercise.

After assigning the tasks, Lin Baiguang personally conducted a preliminary on-site investigation of the environment inside and outside the prefectural city and near the Haikou Thousand-Household Garrison city. He also observed the Baisha Naval Base from a distance and observed the defense system of Haikou.

The entire defense of Haikou was of a considerable standard by the standards of this time. Because Lin Baiguang was on the path of an official career, he had also dabbled in historical works, but most of them were works like the *Zizhi Tongjian*, and he was not interested in the details of history. After D-Day, out of work necessity, he also began to dabble in this area and had a slight knowledge of Ming Dynasty military affairs.

The Baisha Naval Base was not just one place, Baisha Port. It also had camps in the two bays of Dongying and Mangliao, forming a mutually supporting horn formation around Shenying Port. It formed a comprehensive defense system with the Haikou Rear Thousand-Household City on land and several fortresses to the west and south of the prefectural city, guarding Qiongzhou Prefecture.

The entire area around Shenying Port and the Haikou Rear Thousand-Household City was dotted with beacon towers, forts, and fortresses. Patrol boats shuttled back and forth in the port, and the shore was also protected by cheval de frise, with soldiers patrolling and on guard. The defense was very cautious.

Haikou was the center of the land and sea forces of the entire Hainan Island, and also an important hub on the coastal defense front. It was not surprising that it had such a scale.

However, Lin Baiguang believed that it would not be difficult for the Transmigration Group to break through this defense system with its existing forces. If they were to attack five years later, it would be even easier.

The brick and stone forts were equipped with old-style Portuguese breech-loading cannons everywhere—there were even older firearms such as tiger-crouching cannons, bowl-mouthed cannons, and broken-down bamboo-joint cannons. There were not many new-style Western firearms imitated. Even by the military standards of this time, they were already outdated.

It seemed that the Ming government's military reforms in Guangdong had not yet benefited the coastal defense of Hainan. But even if the forts here were built by the best Western military engineers of the 17th century and all the cannons were replaced with Hongyi cannons, they would still be no match for the military power of the Transmigration Group.

After a day of touring, Lin Baiguang had a good idea of the situation. He thought to himself, in fact, taking over the entire Hainan is no longer a problem for the current Transmigration Group. The difficult part is that there is no one to rule and no garrison troops after the occupation—even if they win, they cannot consolidate their occupation.

After returning to the temple, he wrote his first report to Lin'gao. In the report, he believed that the Qiongzhou Prefecture intelligence station could serve as a "practical training base" for training intelligence personnel. The social environment here was relatively simple, and the Ming ruling institutions they faced were also relatively weak. If something happened, it would be easy to rescue them.

Another thing was to use this place as a springboard for intelligence work in Guangdong. The current Guangdong work was carried out by the Guangzhou Station. Lin Baiguang believed that the Guangzhou Station had too heavy an economic burden, and Guo Yi and others were very famous in Guangzhou. It would be very risky to carry out large-scale secret work again. If something went wrong, it would be a devastating blow to the economy of the Transmigration Group. Therefore, he suggested that the intelligence work outside the Pearl River Delta region be separated from the Guangzhou Station and implemented by the Qiongzhou Station, with the Guangzhou Station only providing support.

As for Lin Baiguang's cover identity here, after careful consideration, he decided to open a grain store in Qiongshan County. The Transmigration Group had invested in the grain business in Leizhou, and they could transfer experienced shopkeepers and clerks from there. The business relationship was also ready-made. It was most suitable as a cover.

Rice was a daily necessity that everyone needed. Lin'gao now had many new commodities for sale, almost every one of which could open up a large market here, but Lin Baiguang did not intend to create any commercial miracles here. He only needed a cover identity that would allow him to travel freely to various places in Guangdong for activities. So he did not intend to deal in any commodities related to "Lin'gao."

As for the scale, it did not need to be too large. A capital of one thousand *dan* of unhusked rice would be enough. He would just do normal business. In the future, when the Transmigration Group controlled the entire Hainan Island, the grain store, as an important facility affecting the circulation of grain, could continue to play a role and would not be wasted.

Gao Di and Chen Tong went out for several days in a row, leaving early and returning late. Lin Baiguang stayed in his room alone, planning future intelligence activities, and did not ask them about their progress. On this day, Gao Di came back to report first. He had found several houses.

Lin Baiguang listened as he described the location, structure, and characteristics of the houses one by one, including the transaction conditions.

Gao Di had his eye on three properties, all outside the city, all small courtyards with one or two entrances. All three could be bought or rented. Two were moderately priced, and one was on the West Gate Main Street. Because it had a storefront facing the street, the price was much higher.

"This house has a three-bay facade, a large front yard that can be used as a warehouse. It's a suitable place if we use a business as a cover. There's also a small courtyard in the back, very quiet, and the back door opens to a network of alleys," Gao Di said. "The price is higher than your budget, but for these conditions, the price is not high."

The price was two hundred and eighty taels, including the "customary fees" for the middlemen and guarantors. For the condition of the house, this price was indeed not outrageous.

Lin Baiguang saw that he was travel-worn and his voice was a little hoarse. He knew that he must have spent a lot of effort running around outside these few days. But his results were not bad. And the house he found also met his needs. It seemed that Gao Di was not only able to execute tasks well, but also able to proactively think about how to complete tasks better. This was very commendable.

Chen Tong reported that Hai Shuzu was a descendant of Hai Rui and was considered a local gentry in Qiongshan County because he was under the protection of his ancestor's fame. However, the Hai family's financial situation was very average. In order to protect the reputation of their ancestor, the Hai family had always been law-abiding and never engaged in crooked ways. They lived on a little ancestral property, and it was quite difficult to support a large family. Hai Shuzu had been trying to get rich through business. Recently, he had raised funds from his clan, relatives, and friends to build a large ship to go to the Western Ocean for trade, but it was said that he encountered pirates on the way, and the ship and goods were all robbed. Only the manager and some sailors returned. The creditors came to his door one after another to make a fuss, and he was at his wit's end.

Lin Baiguang knew most of Hai Shuzu's story—his ship and goods were now in Lin'gao, under the control of the Maritime Court. At that time, he had told his manager to go back and ask him to come and get the ship himself, but he hadn't come to get it after several months. It seemed that Hai Shuzu was not very brave. Hearing that creditors were coming to his door to make a fuss, Lin Baiguang smiled: as long as there was external pressure, things would be easy to handle.

As for Hai Shuzu's family matters, Chen Tong had also inquired about some. In general, this person was very ordinary, a well-behaved descendant of a prominent family, but he had a greater desire for wealth than ordinary people—this was probably a common feature of many people in the late Ming Dynasty.

"He has a servant who is from Meizhou, Guangdong," Chen Tong said. "He is a fellow townsman of mine. I have already recognized him as a fellow townsman, so it will be much easier to enter and leave the Hai family in the future..."

"Very good," Lin Baiguang nodded in approval.

As for the expenses, Gao Di spent more than ten taels of silver. According to him, this money was used to build relationships with the "middlemen," and also for him to purchase some silk clothes and hire a sedan chair.

"...If I didn't have some style, things wouldn't have gone so smoothly," he explained his expenses.

"The activity funds were given to you, and how you spend it is your business, as long as it's reasonable," Lin Baiguang said. "But your expenses are too vague. Look at Chen Tong's—"

Chen Tong only spent four taels and three qian of silver, but he produced a detailed expense report, listing everything from treating people to tea and meals to giving someone a pair of shoes. It was much clearer than Gao Di's expense list, which only had "entertainment expenses" for many items.

"Although the activity funds are completely at your disposal, they are still public funds," Lin Baiguang educated them. "The most important thing is the word 'public.' Public funds are not for 'private' use. We are in intelligence work, and we handle a lot of money and have a lot of expenses. The more this is the case, the more clearly the money must be spent, even down to a single coin. Do you understand?"

"Yes."

Lin Baiguang paused and looked at the two teenagers. "Doing your job well is important, but learning to protect yourself in your work is even more important. If you don't pay attention to details in normal times, you won't be able to explain things clearly when something happens. At that time, it will be too late for you to cry foul! And no one will believe you!"

"Yes, we have all noted it down," the two of them nodded.

"Good. Gao Di, you go and buy the house. The one on West Gate Main Street," Lin Baiguang said, taking out eighty taels of silver from the small iron box he carried with him. "This is the deposit. The rest will be paid when the transfer is completed."

"Should we spend a few taels of silver to have the Household Office of Qiongshan County register the case and get an official seal when the transfer is made?" Gao Di suggested.

This was a very safe method, although it seemed superfluous to Lin Baiguang—in another three or four years, the Qiongshan County yamen would be gone, and it would be meaningless to have it register the case. But Gao Di's idea was very meticulous and worth encouraging.

"Good, let's do it that way."

"Alright."

The Qiongzhou intelligence station began to be prepared in full swing. Lin Baiguang did not intend to be the shopkeeper himself. He knew nothing about the grain business. He would have the Intelligence Committee transfer someone from the Leizhou sugar industry. The owner of the Dachang Rice Store, Zhu Fusheng, was very happy to recommend a clerk from his store to be the shopkeeper and head clerk, and said that he was willing to establish business relations with this "Wanfeng Grain Store."

The shopkeeper and head clerk from Dachang would not participate in intelligence work. The intelligence work would be handled by trainees transferred from the training class in Lin'gao, who would serve as clerks and servants. The internal and external lines were separated for easy management and confidentiality.
