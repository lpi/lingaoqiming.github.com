Fu Sinan, upon hearing this, immediately got off the bed and kowtowed to Liu San. Liu San quickly pulled him up.

"Don't kowtow, we don't do that here." He then said, "But since you are to be my apprentice, you will have to leave your home. Are you willing?"

Fu Sinan immediately expressed his willingness. Liu San recalled a guidance document compiled by Wu De, "On Handling Relations with the Natives," which stated that for matters involving personal relationships, such as taking on an apprentice, it was best to have a written agreement to avoid unnecessary disputes in the future.

After a few more days of recuperation, Liu San saw that his illness had fully recovered. He asked the liaison to call Fu Sinan's parents to discuss taking him on as an apprentice. For such a capable doctor to be willing to take their son as an apprentice was, of course, the best thing that could happen to this impoverished family. Although they lost a semi-able-bodied worker, they had one less mouth to feed. Both parties signed an agreement, stipulating that Fu Sinan voluntarily became the apprentice of Liu San of Bairen Village for a period of seven years. During this period, life and death were a matter of fate.

With the written agreement, Fu Sinan was now Liu San's apprentice in the legal sense of the Ming Dynasty. Liu San could treat him however he wanted, except for beating him to death.

After taking on an apprentice, Liu San thought about "purifying" him and also teaching him to read and write, so that he wouldn't be unable to even read basic medical books. He no longer had the heart to stay in Daolu Village. After giving some instructions to Dong Weiwei, he took his apprentice back to Bairen.

Fu Sinan rushed to carry Liu San's basket. Liu San smiled and said, "I'd better carry it myself."

"When there is work to be done, the disciple should do it," Fu Sinan said respectfully.

"Oh, aren't you illiterate? You speak so elegantly," although he said this, Liu San still carried the basket himself.

"The village schoolteacher said it," Fu Sinan said seriously. "In the past, when apprentices passed by the school, the schoolteacher would ask the students to do work and always say this."

"It seems you quite like to study," Liu San was satisfied. If he didn't like to study, his plan to cultivate him would be in vain. It seemed that he not only liked to study but also had a good memory.

"Yes, Master," Fu Sinan said.

Liu San brought Fu Sinan to Bairen. Everything here amazed and confused the boy, who was new to this place. After all, he was a child who had never even been to the county town. He had heard from his fellow villagers that there was a most prosperous East Gate Market outside the county town now, which was not only prosperous but also had many novelties that people had never seen in their lives. When he arrived at the East Gate Market, his eyes couldn't take it all in.

"Stop looking, you silly boy," Liu San patted his head. "You'll have plenty of time to look later."

He then led the boy to a group of buildings surrounded by a wire fence outside Bairen City—this was also a quarantine camp, established to accommodate the increasing number of personnel recruited from the local population. The Ministry of Health had also set up a quarantine camp outside Bairen City.

The person in charge here was Bai Yu from the Ministry of Education. When this one-meter-eighty-tall man appeared before them, swaying, Fu Sinan gasped. The legends of the tall and sturdy Australians were not exaggerated.

"Call him Teacher Bai!" Liu San instructed.

Fu Sinan was about to kowtow again, but Bai Yu stopped him. "We don't kneel to people!"

Being lifted by this big man, the thin and small Fu Sinan had no ability to resist and was immediately lifted up.

"Teacher Bai," he said obediently.

"Bai Yu, this child is in your hands."

"Where did this child come from?" Bai Yu sized him up. "He looks a bit weak."

"From the Thirteen Villages area. He was sick and has just recovered."

"There have been a lot of children sent from this place recently," Bai Yu flipped through the registration book. "This child is not in the transfer plan."

"He's my apprentice. Just sign him up for a literacy class, I'll teach him the rest myself."

"You've taken on an apprentice too?" Bai Yu smiled. "Nanhai took on a female disciple, raising a loli from a young age. Why did you choose a male apprentice, to raise a shota?"

"Don't joke," Liu San said. "An apprentice is also a helper. This child is in your hands."

"Alright, I'll teach him well," Bai Yu promised. He said to Fu Sinan, "Come on, let's get you cleaned up first."

Fu Sinan enjoyed the full purification process here. When he came out, he was a bald-headed boy in a standard blue student uniform. He seemed quite confused by his new image.

"Alright," Liu San looked with satisfaction at this person who smelled of plant-based soap essence. "You will live here for a few dozen days. You must listen to the teachers here and study hard. Otherwise, he will whip your bottom until you can't sit down. I'll come to pick you up in a few days."

Fu Sinan said he was already prepared to be beaten—which apprentice wasn't beaten by their master, mistress, and senior brothers?

Bai Yu pulled over a notebook. "What's his name, how old is he?"

"Fu Sinan. Eleven years old."

"The name needs to be changed," Bai Yu frowned. "They all have this kind of name, who can tell them apart!"

"Let's call him Fu Wuben," Liu San said.

So Fu Sinan's name was changed to Fu Wuben. He received a sturdy cloth bag filled to the brim with two wide straps and a small bamboo tag tied with a string, which he hung around his neck—it had his name and serial number carved on it. Thus, the original Lin'gao native Fu Sinan officially entered the system of the transmigrator group and became Fu Wuben.

After finishing the procedures, Liu San went to the Bairen General Hospital to report on his trip to the countryside.

He excitedly handed the medical record of the tetanus treatment with traditional Chinese medicine to Shi Niaoren. "This is great! We don't have to worry about the problem of running out of tetanus antitoxin anymore!"

Shi Niaoren, however, was not as excited as he was. He sullenly flipped through all the materials and said one sentence:

"The clinical trials are not enough."

Although Liu San was from a pharmacology background, he didn't think this was wrong. After all, since the availability of tetanus antitoxin in the country, there had been very few cases of tetanus patients being treated purely with traditional Chinese medicine.

"But Yuzhen San is also a proven formula for treating tetanus."

"First, it's hard to say now that what you cured was tetanus," Shi Niaoren said unceremoniously. "There's no bacterial culture, no pathology report, not even a temperature record. We can't confirm that he had tetanus. This violates the rigor of modern medicine."

"Second, so-called proven formulas, many of which have been proven by modern medicine and pharmacology to be completely ineffective, or even harmful—there are also proven formulas for rabies, and there seem to be several. But what's the reality?" Shi Niaoren said, "Once rabies develops, there is no cure, whether it's traditional Chinese medicine or modern medicine! Without the antitoxin, it's a dead end."

"Then what do we do when the antitoxin runs out?" Liu San became agitated when he heard his beloved traditional Chinese pharmacology being criticized as worthless. "Even if we save it, the antitoxin will expire one day!"

"We need to conduct large-scale clinical trials. But conducting such trials now is a bit risky."

The so-called risk was that, not to mention the transmigrators themselves, even if the native laborers and soldiers they recruited and trained died because of such unsuccessful attempts, it would be a great loss.

"Can't we use animal experiments?"

"Let's put it this way," Shi Niaoren said painfully. "The people here have thought of everything, but no one thought to bring a pair of white mice."

"Aren't there rabbits on the farm?" With Liu San's limited knowledge of zoology, he knew that the reproduction rate of rabbits was comparable to that of their relatives, the mice.

"According to Nanhai, the rabbits have been unwilling to have sex recently. It's too hot here. There are only a few rabbits now, and a group of people are eagerly waiting to eat them. Do you expect to use them for experiments?"

"Since we can't do animal experiments, we'll have to do human experiments!" someone said at the door. The two of them looked up and saw that it was the only psychologist, Jiang Qiuyan. This person had gone out to sea with the island survey team and had not appeared at the Bairen General Hospital for some time.

"It's you, the survey team is back?!" Shi Niaoren was somewhat surprised.

"We're back, safe and sound!" Jiang Qiuyan looked tanned, but his body was clean. He was carrying a cattail bag.

"When did you get back? Wasn't there any news in the Times?"

"We docked early in the morning. I've already taken a shower, changed my clothes, and had a meal. The others are still busy at the pier. This is one of the benefits of being a doctor." He continued, "Actually, why don't we just do clinical trials directly? Minister Shi, if you're not willing to try it on the native laborers, you can just do it as part of the medical outreach to the countryside."

This meant using the non-system P-min as clinical trial subjects. In fact, this was also Shi Niaoren's true intention. But he had been in America for a long time and sometimes spoke more tactfully.

"Hmm, hmm," Shi Niaoren was noncommittal. "Liu San, organize this treatment plan first."

This generally meant approval. Liu San's anger also subsided. He asked Jiang Qiuyan about the results of the deserted island survey.

"The results are great!" Jiang Qiuyan said as he poured out a few coconuts from the cattail bag. "Come, let's drink coconut water. We got several thousand of them, plenty to drink!"

"Good, good." Shi Niaoren immediately ordered everyone to be called over and also got some ice from the refrigerator. A group of doctors immediately began to drink iced coconut juice.

"Delicious! So refreshing!" He Ma had just finished a clinical lesson with the intern female doctors and was sweating all over. A glass of cool drink went down, and he felt so comfortable that he was about to fly. Ai Beibei, however, refused to drink and carefully wrapped up a coconut, preparing to take it home for her child.

"Sister-in-law, just drink up. This is off-plan," Jiang Qiuyan said with a smile.

"There's an on-plan one?" Shi Niaoren asked.

"The on-plan one is one for each person, regardless of gender, age, or type of work," Jiang Qiuyan said. "In addition, heavy manual laborers and military officers have extra rations. The native workers can also get some, but not one for each person. By the way, the coconuts have to be handed over to the cafeteria after drinking the water."

"Are they planning to make curry? Wu Nanhai recently transferred the Indian from the labor reform team to his farm—he doesn't even mind the smell."

PS: The following content is over 3000 words and is not charged.

There is a debate about whether traditional Chinese medicine can treat tetanus. Some say it can and cite many cases, while others say it cannot. For the sake of argument, let's assume it can.
