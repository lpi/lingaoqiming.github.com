"These past few days, I've been watching. Most people are good, working diligently. But some people!" Chang Shide pointed to seven or eight individuals lying on straw mats, covered with straw curtains, their buttocks and thighs clearly swollen, moaning weakly.

"After a few full meals, they became complacent. Making them village cadres was a sign of trust. If they had done well, they would have been given more responsibility in the future. But they didn't appreciate it. They thought a steady meal wasn't good enough and had to dip their hands into the pot of gold. The government has already dealt with them, so we won't pursue the matter further. However, their positions as village cadres are gone. The money they embezzled will be added to their debt. It might take them seventy or eighty years of work to pay it off."

"As for those who knew they were wrong and voluntarily returned the stolen goods, we will not punish them further. They will be dismissed from their posts on the spot, and their term of labor will be extended by one to five years. We are lenient: whoever committed the crime will bear the responsibility. Their families will not be implicated." Chang Shide had already made arrangements with the few who had voluntarily returned the stolen goods and their families. As soon as he finished speaking, these people immediately started crying and shouting:

"The masters are benevolent!"

"Wuwuwu, I am worse than a pig or a dog—"

"From now on, I will work for the masters with all my heart, even if it means jumping into a pit of fire!"

The atmosphere infected the surrounding crowd, and the meeting became somewhat lively. Chang Shide felt that the effect was quite good. It seemed the manual "How to Propagandize and Agitate" was quite effective.

"You sugar masters—" Chang Shide's finger pointed to them. In the "killing the chicken to scare the monkey" operation a few days ago, Wen Tong, for the purpose of protecting technical personnel, did not arrest any sugar workers, but everyone was forced to watch. After returning from the yamen, everyone quickly returned the embezzled sugar. Unexpectedly, Master Chang, with a mysterious smile, refused to accept it, only asking each person to write a confession. It didn't matter if they couldn't write; there were pre-written forms where they just had to fill in the numbers and press their thumbprint. These people had been worried for several days. When they were ordered to attend the general meeting today, they were all uneasy. Now that they were being called out, they couldn't hold it together any longer. They all fell to their knees, their pleas for mercy echoing endlessly.

Then, Chang Shide revealed his true intentions. He wanted them all to join the Leizhou Sugar Company and no longer be temporary workers. Their treatment would be the same as the immigrants, with food and wages. As for the portion they had secretly skimmed, it would be considered an advance on their salary.

Chang Shide portrayed himself as being incredibly lenient, but no one below was a fool. They knew that if they dared to say "no," he had their confessions and connections with the county yamen. They would be immediately taken to the yamen and beaten half to death, ending up in a cangue at the yamen gate to feed the flies like the other unlucky ones. Regardless of whether they were willing or not, they all said, "We are willing to join the sugar factory."

"Work hard, and you won't be treated unfairly," Chang Shide said, looking at the dejected sugar masters, thinking that this was a pretty good deal.

Next, he reappointed the vacant village cadre positions. Wen Tong had wanted to keep some of the less problematic cadres in their original posts—after all, there were very few suitable candidates. But Chang Shide felt that this would be too lenient. He insisted on a "zero tolerance" policy to let the workers know his attitude. It didn't matter if the newly appointed people were less capable; they were no worse than the previous ones.

"Serve our Leizhou Sugar Company well, and you will definitely not be at a loss!" Chang Shide then announced: from this day forward, the profits would be divided according to the rules of Guo Yi's various businesses in Guangzhou. The dividends would be divided into thirteen major shares: ten for the shareholders, and three for the bonuses and welfare of all the employees of the sugar company. Everyone, from the sugar masters to the laborers in the sugarcane fields, would get a share.

The income adjustment was based on the wage system implemented by the Guangzhou station in its subordinate enterprises. Chang Shide also set up a grading system, dividing everyone into two categories: agricultural workers and sugar workers, each with three to four levels. Salaries were paid according to individual abilities. Village chiefs, militia captains, and the like were also considered agricultural workers and were graded according to their abilities, with an additional allowance for their positions.

To further increase labor productivity, in addition to sharing the profits, Chang Shide also launched a labor competition among the plantations. It was evaluated once a month, and the plantation that harvested the most sugarcane and produced the most sugar with the least loss would receive an extra reward.

Wen Tong and the others, keenly aware of the importance of grassroots cadres, launched a village cadre rotation training program. The newly appointed village cadres from all the villages were transferred to the South China Sugar Factory for training. In addition to learning some basic literacy, they were also taught about sugarcane cultivation, field management, and sugar production.

After this combination of stick and carrot, the sugar company entered a stable phase, and morale stabilized. Sugar production climbed steadily. Boats and handcarts carrying raw sugar, molasses, and bagasse to the South China Factory flowed in an endless stream. This previously unknown business began to be a topic of conversation among the sugar merchants on Haian Street.

Chang Shide became somewhat complacent. In addition to teaching the rotation trainees every day, he also started a teacher training class, preparing to open a primary school for the children of the factory workers after the sugar harvest season. He was too lazy to teach so many children himself, so he got the idea of using the female slaves. He had Wen Xiu act as a teaching assistant and started the teacher training. Classes were held during the day, and evening classes continued at night. Wen Xiu and A'Zhu were excluded.

"Teacher, I was wrong, please forgive your student—" the Mandarin was still a bit stilted.

"Let me punish you properly, you bad child."

Wen Tong often heard this incongruous yet ecstatic Mandarin when he walked past Chang Shide's room at night.

"You big pervert," Wen Tong had always been scornful of this kind of S&M cosplay. Fortunately, the man still had some brotherly affection and didn't drag A'Zhu to any night classes—he was very much in favor of her attending the teacher training class. It was a pity that he was so busy with the sugar factory every day that by the time he returned to the courtyard, he just wanted to sleep. He didn't even have the energy to take A'Zhu. Old Chang's constitution was truly robust. Busy during the day, busy at night—Wen Tong couldn't help but feel a wave of sorrow: the difference between people, why is it so great?

Wen Tong's entire focus recently had been on the technical reform of the sugar factory. Of the two technical reform directions he had originally envisioned, one was to produce white sugar, which he had already achieved. Although the process was backward and the output was low, it was very suitable for their current industrial level. The next step was to focus on expanding the scale and improving efficiency.

The other was to increase the yield of sugarcane juice. Modern sugar factories used at least a three-roller steel press, with a juice extraction rate of over 70%. Larger factories even had twelve-roller equipment, and the bagasse came out almost completely dry. Wen Tong decided to first eliminate the wooden rollers at the South China Factory. Initially, he considered using stone, but the efficiency of stone rollers was not much higher than wood, and the consumption of ox power was equally huge.

Using a multi-roller steel press was still the best choice. Wen Tong remembered that the Zhanjiang area had only started to gradually replace the primitive ox-drawn stone rollers with semi-mechanized two-roller or three-roller small presses in the mid-1960s. At that time, they mostly used two-roller small presses from Chaozhou, with a juice extraction rate of over 60%. Later, they switched to three-roller small presses from Shunde, and the juice extraction rate increased to 72%-73%. This figure, compared to the average juice extraction rate of 45% for stone rollers, meant that the sugar output could be increased by 60% without changing the sugarcane yield!

This number was too tempting for Wen Tong. And this kind of equipment was technically quite simple; the transmigrators' industrial capacity could completely produce it.

But using a three-roller steel press meant they had to consider the power source. This was not something that could be pulled by water buffaloes. In reality, the three-roller presses used by the semi-mechanized small factories in Zhanjiang were all driven by 20-horsepower diesel engines. Now that diesel was scarce, Wen Tong naturally thought of water power. He even went to inspect the only sugar mill with a water-powered roller, but he was rather disappointed after the visit. The water-powered roller was just a simple water wheel, with no canals or dams, basically utilizing the natural drop of the river, and its efficiency was very low.

The South China Factory had a usable river, but the river was gentle and the flow was not large enough. Although Wen Tong was a layman in hydraulics, he knew that to install a water turbine on this river that could drive a three-roller steel press, it would be impossible without building a dam to store water. Once a dam was built, it would involve the water use of the upstream and downstream, which would definitely not be an easy matter. It might even drag him into a protracted lawsuit. So he vetoed this idea.

It would be better to use a steam engine to drive it. Wen Tong thought that a water turbine, which would cost a lot to build, could only be used to press sugarcane. If he could get a steam engine, he could introduce many efficiency-improving devices, and the machine's utilization efficiency would be much higher than that of a water turbine. With a steam engine, there would be a boiler, and the steam produced by the boiler would also be useful for sugar production. At least when heating the sugarcane juice, it could be heated very evenly, reducing the possibility of scorching.

There were many types of machinery that could be used in sugar production. If they were serious, they could achieve fully mechanized production. Of course, this was a future trend. Wen Tong considered the process of the South China Sugar Factory and selected several simple and easy-to-operate processing machines.

After thinking it through, he sent a carrier pigeon to Zhang Xin in Guangzhou, explaining his ideas and attaching a list of the machinery he requested. He also asked Lingao to provide necessary infrastructure materials such as cement, steel bars, and bricks—to upgrade to semi-mechanized production, the scale would have to be expanded accordingly.

Wen Tong's report was transferred to Lingao via the Guangzhou station. After a brief discussion, the Executive Committee agreed to allocate him all the equipment he needed.

Two weeks later, a large ship arrived at the port of Haian Street. The arrival of this ship caused quite a stir. The ship's design was too special. It was large, about the size of a 400-liao ship, but its draft was very shallow, almost flat-bottomed. The deck was wide, and apart from the sterncastle and two masts, there were no protrusions on the deck.

The wide deck was piled with boxes of all sizes, as well as some very large cargo wrapped in wooden frames and straw mats. The cargo was tightly secured with a large net. This kind of cargo ship with all the goods piled on the deck was a real eye-opener for everyone and attracted a crowd of onlookers. Who was the shipwright who came up with this idea? With all the goods piled on the deck, wouldn't they get wet in a storm?

Seeing this large flat-decked ship, Chang Shide thought it was a bit too anachronistic. It was simply out of place. As he was thinking, the large ship slowly approached the pier. The sailors set up a gangplank, and a familiar figure walked over.

Looking closely, it was actually Bei Wei, the captain of the Special Reconnaissance Team, a rare sight. In the months after D-Day, he could often be seen leading his team everywhere, but later he became more and more mysterious. He was no longer seen in places where ordinary people gathered. The last time Chang Shide had seen him was during the political consultative conference, where he was leading his men to secure the high ground.

Such a person, who had nothing to do with trade or industry, why did he suddenly appear on a ship to Leizhou? Was there a secret mission? Did the Executive Committee think Leizhou was a big piece of fat meat and wanted to occupy it first? But they hadn't even taken over the whole of Hainan Island—

As his thoughts ran wild, Bei Wei had already approached. He was wearing Ming Dynasty clothes, a short outfit like a common laborer. He was followed by a few unfamiliar, able-bodied young men, probably members of the Special Reconnaissance Team. Just as he was about to speak, Bei Wei gave him a look, signaling him not to speak. He then led his men and blended into the team of laborers preparing to unload the machinery.

Next to appear were the real leaders of this transport mission. One was Mei Lin from the Lingao Construction Company, obviously here to take charge of the civil engineering work of the sugar factory. The other two he didn't know, probably from the machinery department, here to assist with the installation of the machinery. All three of them were wearing straight robes, with wigs and headscarves, looking out of place and uncomfortable.

"Welcome, welcome," Chang Shide hurried forward to greet them. Now that he was "stationed abroad," he had to be enthusiastic towards the cadres from the "capital." "Old Mei, you're on a business trip this time? And these two are..."

Mei Lin quickly introduced them, "They are both from the machinery factory. This is Xiao Gui, here to install the steam engine, and this is Chen Tianxiong—"

"My name is Chen Tianxiong. The Executive Committee has transferred me to Leizhou this time to be specifically responsible for the operation and debugging of the sugar factory's machinery. I'll also train a few workers along the way." The speaker was nearly forty, with a calm demeanor and a body that still looked very strong, no less than a young man's.

"This is great! I was worried about what to do with the maintenance and upkeep after the machinery is installed!" He glanced around. "This is not the place to talk. Let's go to the tea shed over there to rest first."

Because there was a lot of cargo to unload, Chang Shide had already arranged to book a tea shed as a place to supervise the unloading and rest. It was guarded on all sides by the Qiwei escorts.

"I didn't expect you to be so fast," Chang Shide said, making small talk and having Wen Xiu bring tea. "Come, have some water. Have some water." He sat down. After Wen Xiu had left, he asked, "Is all the equipment here?"
