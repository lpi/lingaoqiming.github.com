"Captain, fire on the beacon tower!" Mei Wan's voice was sharp with alarm.

Bei Wei looked up. A column of thick smoke was rising from the tower, a stark black line against the pale dawn sky. The signal had been lit.

He had anticipated this. A silent takedown of the watchtower had been proposed, but Xi Yazhou had vetoed it. Time was a luxury they did not have. They had to land, establish a beachhead, and fortify their position before the Ming authorities could react. The Qiongzhou Strait was a busy shipping lane. Their anachronistic fleet would be spotted soon enough. The beacon fire would only accelerate the inevitable by an hour or two.

"Ignore it," Bei Wei commanded. "Continue charting the channel." The priority was to get the ships into the harbor.

Mei Wan, however, was still unnerved. "Will they send reinforcements?" he whispered.

"They won't." Bei Wei's voice was confident, though he was not entirely certain himself. Yu E'shui had assured them that the garrison in Lingao was non-existent, the beacon tower merely an early warning system. Still, he would have preferred to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed.

The small boat moved through the rising tide, dropping buoys to mark the channel. It drifted toward the pier at the base of the beacon tower, where a cluster of low, tiled-roof buildings huddled under a flagpole. This was the Bopu Inspection Office. The place was deserted, though a lantern still burned on the flagpole, its light a faint glimmer in the growing dawn.

"Fix bayonets!" Bei Wei commanded. He switched off the safety on his rifle and leaped from the boat onto the pier. The assault was a textbook execution, but the office was empty. The straw mats on the beds were still warm, a pot of water still simmering on the stove. The occupants had fled only moments before.

The inspection office, Bei Wei knew, was a place of little value. The pirates who frequented these waters would have no reason to plunder it. But the transmigrators were not pirates. They were conquerors. And this, their first conquest, was to be a symbol of their new power. They swarmed through the buildings, their minds filled with visions of a new command post, a new capital.

Bei Wei sent a team to the top of the tower to extinguish the fire and set up a watch. Another team took up positions on the roof of the office, their rifles covering the surrounding area. He reported to the flagship: the Bopu Inspection Office was secure. No casualties.

A wave of relief washed over the *Fengcheng*. The gateway to Lingao was open.

"Let's begin!" [Ma Qianzhu][y005] commanded. The order was relayed to the fleet. Anchors were weighed. The *Fengcheng* and the barge sailed side-by-side, flanked by the four fishing boats. The North American yacht unfurled its sails, a brilliant white against the morning sky. The fleet moved toward the harbor, a trail of white wake in its path.

Behind them, the sun burst forth, painting the sky in fiery hues. The South China Sea glittered with a golden light. It was the dawn of a new world. The transmigrators on deck stood in silence, their hearts filled with an almost unbearable excitement. *I am witnessing history,* they thought, *and I am creating it.*

Someone began to sing "Ode to the Motherland." The song, at first a single, hesitant voice, swelled into a powerful chorus, a hymn to a future they were about to build.

"Sound the horn!" the Executive Committee ordered as they entered the harbor. The ship's horn blared, a sound from another time, announcing the arrival of a new era.

For now, they would remain on the ships, a floating city awaiting its foundation. The engineers and laborers were ferried ashore in small boats, their task to build a port, a base of operations for their advance inland.

Bopu Port was not an ideal location. It was exposed to the northwest winds, and the annual typhoons were a constant threat. But it was the closest they could get to their chosen base camp.

The engineers, led by Yan Quezhi, had decided on a floating pier, a simple, expedient solution. It would be constructed from rows of sealed 200-liter iron drums, welded together and topped with corrugated steel plates. It was a crude, makeshift affair, but it would serve its purpose.

The assembly was a chaotic, frustrating process. The rise and fall of the waves made it nearly impossible to align the connecting bolts. Men fell into the water, their curses lost in the clang of metal on metal. But by late morning, a 150-meter-long, 8-meter-wide jetty stretched from the shore to the *Fengcheng*.

The members of the Executive Committee watched from the ship, their hearts swelling with pride. "[Ma Qianzhu][y005]" declared, "I propose that this jetty be named 'Project Number One,' and that a monument be erected to commemorate this day!"

"A monument is fine," [Wen Desi][y002] replied, ever the pragmatist. "But we must replace this with a permanent structure before the next typhoon season."

Their conversation was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a foreign woman, snapping photos with a digital camera. It was Panpan, the American girlfriend of the reporter, Ding Ding. He followed close behind, a voice recorder in his hand, and immediately began to interview [Ma Qianzhu][y005]. The restless reporter had already gathered a team and was preparing to launch the transmigrators' first newspaper: the *Lingao Times*.

"No feelings," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said, his gruff demeanor a poor disguise for the emotion churning within him.

"And you, [Director Wen][y002]?" Ding Ding asked, turning his attention to his next subject.

"A historic day," [Wen Desi][y002] replied, his voice filled with a quiet awe.
