Cao Guangjiu took the visiting card and trembled in shock. He repeatedly said, "Quick! Open the central gate, say I will personally welcome him!"

"The master who came said there was no need for such ceremony. I took the liberty of welcoming him to the flower hall..."

"Good, good," Cao Guangjiu waved his hand and urged, "You go first, say I dare not accept the card, and that I will go out to see him now." He then stomped his foot and scolded the maid, "Are you all dead? Get me changed!"

An hour later, he saw off the clerk who had come to visit. The master of the card had too great a reputation to come and see him himself, but just a clerk with a visiting card was enough to give him face. Cao Guangjiu shut himself in his study for a long time. He could not quite figure out the other party's intentions.

He certainly knew that the other party could not come forward himself and wanted to use him as a pawn. As long as he could get enough benefits, being a pawn was not a problem. The problem was, he didn't know what the other party wanted to do. This had to be weighed carefully, and it was also the reason why he had not dared to agree completely.

From the other party's words, he already knew that the master of the card wanted to deal with the newly emerged Master Zhao. Although this master's background was great, the Catholic gentry behind Master Zhao were not to be trifled with. A "poxue dang" like him, caught in the middle, might get his head broken.

But the benefits behind this were truly tantalizing, and he, a "poxue dang," could not help but swallow this bait.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but touch the pocket the other party had someone bring him. It was heavy. Cao Guangjiu gritted his teeth. Men die for wealth as birds die for food. Master Zhao was just an outsider. Although he had some reputation, he was not as deeply rooted as the master of the card. It was better to lean against a big tree for shade. The opportunity could not be missed.

At this moment, Zhao Yigong was in the estate arranging the "*shaoye*" work.

The smooth implementation of the spring silkworm plan and the official start of the silk reeling factory had given him full confidence. Especially this time, the local gentry and silk firm owners who had benefited greatly from the cocoon and silk operation had all expressed their "admiration" for him on various occasions. He had become a "capable person" who was good at maneuvering. Naturally, there were also many who were envious and jealous.

This year's *shaoye* work was not on a large scale. He only needed to satisfy the sericulture needs of the three "core villages" and a dozen or so "peripheral villages" that he planned to cooperate with, as well as the sericulture farm set up by the Cihui Hall. These villages' sericulturists also had some of their own mulberry groves and could be self-sufficient to some extent. Even if the scale of sericulture were to be further expanded next year, the increase would be limited.

Therefore, in the beginning, he did not spend too many resources on controlling the supply of mulberry leaves. He had no intention of directly controlling the mulberry groves themselves. The taxes on this were very heavy. Secondly, the cost of buying *shaoye* was not large, and it was convenient to use. Moreover, if he were to raise summer and autumn silkworms, the price of *shaoye* would be pitifully low. Originally, mulberry leaves were only valuable in the spring season. For the rest of the year, besides the branches that could be used for weaving baskets and as firewood, and the mulberries, there was little profit. So when the people he sent went to the various mulberry groves to request *shaoye* for the summer and autumn seasons, the owners of the mulberry groves all thought they were crazy.

The conditions offered by Zhao Yigong were very generous: a contract price of one tael of silver per mu. From now until the leaves fell in autumn, all the mulberry leaves produced in the mulberry grove would belong to Zhao Yigong. Zhao's people could come and pick the mulberry leaves at any time. The picking of the mulberry leaves did not require the owner's help and would be done entirely by Zhao's servants. Anyway, for the current Zhao Yigong, manpower was the least valuable input. A large number of free laborers, it would be a waste not to use them.

For the mulberry grove owners, although the income of one tael per mu was small, it was at least extra income.

It was a small supplement for them. Therefore, the work of purchasing the "shaoye" for the summer and autumn seasons went very smoothly. Zhao Yigong did not spend much silver to purchase enough mulberry leaves for the two seasons.

He had originally wanted to buy the *shaoye* quota for next spring in one go, not only to meet his own needs but also to make a huge profit by selling it later. However, he found that the capital to be invested was quite large. He was currently operating too many projects at the same time: bookstores, printing and publishing, sericulture, raw silk, maritime trade... and this huge refugee camp. Each of them required a large amount of capital to operate. The cash flow was mainly maintained by the money from the China Merchants' Bureau. Such a juggling act was not unique to the old timeline, and it was not impossible that someone would see through his little tricks.

Now, it could only be considered a small situation. Although he still had many ideas, Zhao Yigong could only be satisfied for the time being. The bigger steps would have to be taken next year. At present, he lacked sufficient strength, and the influence of the Fanhaijin was not enough. In this society where the上位者 takes all, he had to be careful. There were still many things he had to do now.

"Jiying!"

He called out, and Jiying immediately appeared at the door of the study, waiting for his orders.

"Prepare a boat for me, to Shanghai!"

To facilitate his travels in Jiangnan, he had long since specially purchased a Wuxi fast boat. With one order, the boatmen would row in shifts day and night, and in a few days, they could reach the important political and commercial centers of Jiangnan such as Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing. Shanghai, in particular, was the most important commercial channel for the Fanhaijin in the entire Jiangnan region. Shanhai Wulu had set up institutions here. Zhao Yigong's upcoming trade activities with Japan also used Shanghai as the operation center.

The goods to be shipped to Japan were currently being gradually transported to Shanghai for assembly. In addition to the traditional export goods to Japan such as raw silk, silk, white sugar, Chinese medicinal materials, and porcelain, which were purchased by the Hangzhou station from suppliers in Jiangnan, Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, there were also a large number of daily necessities and hardware produced in Lingao.

Although Japan in the 17th century had made great progress in agriculture and commerce, its handicraft industry was very backward. It could not be said that traditional Japanese handicrafts were not highly skilled, but they were very specialized. The exquisiteness of niche consumer goods far exceeded the general level, but both the quality and production capacity of mass consumer goods were seriously insufficient. In history, they had to rely on a large number of imported Chinese-made daily necessities to ensure supply. The scarcity of hardware, in particular, far exceeded the imagination of ordinary people. Even the most common hardware like iron nails was often unavailable. The so-called lack of nails for the construction of the Great Buddha and temples, and thus the need to carry out the "sword hunt," was not a ridiculous excuse in the eyes of the people at that time.

And in the current industrial system of the Fanhaijin, the industrial products that could be exported and dumped in large quantities, besides paper, were hardware. In addition to being exported in large quantities to the Guangdong market, they were also exported to Jiangnan. This time, the export to Japan would naturally not be missed.

However, he had rushed to Shanghai not for the matter of exporting to Japan, but because Shen Tingyang had invited him to discuss something. The letter did not specify the specific matter, only saying that "the matter is urgent."

What matter was so urgent that he had to be called to discuss it immediately, and the location was chosen in Shanghai! Shanghai was the future headquarters of the China Merchants' Bureau, the starting point for trade with Japan and the sea transport of tribute grain. To discuss it here was obviously related to these two matters.

Zhao Yigong pondered this matter all the way. As soon as he arrived in Shanghai and settled in the mansion, he did not care about his travel fatigue and immediately instructed someone to go to the Shen family's mansion to deliver a letter, arranging a meeting with Shen Tingyang.

That evening, the two met in Zhao Yigong's Shanghai mansion.

Zhao Yigong was originally very worried that Shen Tingyang would cause trouble with the matter of contributing his ships as shares, but unexpectedly, the other party was full of smiles. As soon as they met, he cupped his hands in congratulations.

"The court finally has some sensible people!" Shen Tingyang was very excited.

"What?!" Zhao Yigong originally knew that it had nothing to do with the matter of exporting to Japan, and his heart was relieved by half. He knew that the other party's most concerned matter was to abolish the canal transport and switch to sea transport. Seeing this, could it be that the Ming court had really changed its ways? Had they experimented with sea transport of tribute grain earlier than in history? He tentatively said, "Could it be that the court has already agreed to abolish the canal transport and switch to sea transport?"

"Hehehe, you're joking!" Shen Tingyang laughed. "If the court acted with such decisiveness, how could it be in its current state!"

Zhao Yigong smiled awkwardly and felt that it was better for him to say less on this issue. He, Shen Tingyang, was a local tycoon of Jiangnan. It didn't matter what he said. It was better for him, an outsider, to be more discreet.

Shen Tingyang also seemed to feel that it was inappropriate for him to comment on the court's politics in this way, and he immediately returned to the original topic:

"A major matter like abolishing the canal transport and switching to sea transport cannot be accomplished overnight. But there is a matter at hand now. If it is done well, it will be the cause of the future abolition of the canal transport."

He told Zhao Yigong that after the suppression of the Dengzhou rebellion, the entire system of transporting grain and provisions from Dengzhou to Liaodong had been completely destroyed. The grain, silver, and military equipment originally gathered in Dengzhou were also lost. The documents requesting grain and provisions from Guanning and Dongjiang were flying in like snowflakes.

"...You probably also know the habits of these soldiers," Shen Tingyang was probably in a very good mood, so he was very talkative. "Since the end of the Wanli reign, the world has been in turmoil, and troops have been needed everywhere. These generals have all become arrogant and domineering. Without grain and provisions, they won't even move, let alone fight. For so many years, the court has invested millions of taels of silver and grain every year, just to barely maintain the situation."

After the Dengzhou rebellion, the supply line to Dongjiang and Guanning was immediately cut off. Land transport was time-consuming and consumed even more manpower and material resources. Therefore, both the Ministry of War and the Grand Secretariat were eager to find new supply routes.

"...So this time, the court has issued a decree to transport tribute grain directly from Jiangnan to Liaodong!" Shen Tingyang seemed very happy.

"Is this matter to be handled by you, Brother Wumei?"

"Exactly!" Shen Tingyang was so excited that he almost danced. His excitement was hard to express. "I have already asked someone to submit a memorial and have also submitted the *Book of Sea Transport* and the *Map of Sea Transport*."

Zhao Yigong vaguely remembered that this matter should have happened after Shen Tingyang became a secretary of the Grand Secretariat. The current Shen Tingyang was still just an imperial college student, and it would be several years before he became a secretary. Obviously, something had changed.
