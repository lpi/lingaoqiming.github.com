With the conclusion of the "First Institutional Framework Meeting," the transmigration plan entered a new phase. The professional groups were tasked with preparing plans, proposals, and procurement lists for their respective fields. The number of new arrivals steadily increased.

Every newcomer, after registration, underwent a 30-day, full-time basic military training program, which included drill, earthwork, obstacle courses, combat, and basic survival skills.

After training, they were assigned to various professional groups for planning and preparation work, or sent for further skills training. [Zhan Wuya][y004]'s small machinery factory had become a de facto technical school, piled high with scrapped parts. Some were even sent to vocational schools for short-term training.

Former IT elites learned to lay bricks and tiles; former office clerks learned to operate sewing machines; and many who had never set foot in a workshop now found themselves clumsily learning a trade at a machine tool or workbench.

The technically skilled transmigrators, in addition to their daily paperwork and meetings, also took on the role of instructors.

[Wu Nanhai][y009]'s task was particularly daunting. He was responsible for turning a group of city dwellers, most of whom had never seen a farm, into agricultural experts.

One thing was non-negotiable: everyone at the base, regardless of their work, participated in a daily long-distance run. As [Chief Wen][y002] had said, "If you can't beat them, you at least have to be able to outrun the natives."

The Sports Group also organized nightly military sports games, a way to hone their bodies and reaction skills.

Not everyone who came stayed. Some hesitated, some backed out. The allure of their old lives was too strong. To gamble on an unknown future in another world required a special kind of courage. Others, who had come seeking an escape from social constraints, chafed under the strict schedule and rules, and left after a few days.

But the ones who stayed were dedicated. Fueled by the feverish excitement of their unprecedented adventure, they worked tirelessly, drafting plans and proposals. The corridors echoed with the sounds of shouting, arguing, and the clatter of keyboards. The General Affairs Group distributed a steady supply of tea and coffee. Cigarettes were a luxury they could not afford.

The sheer scale of the organizational and coordination work was a challenge. If this were a normal company, the initial chaos would have resulted in heavy financial losses. [Xiao Zishan][y001], as he handed over one red envelope after another to the finance department, felt a pang of regret. The money would be worthless in the new world, but still...

The Executive Committee had not anticipated the complexity of the undertaking. The modern industrial system, with its thousands of interconnected parts, was a marvel. [Xiao Zishan][y001], who handled the procurement lists, was constantly amazed.

The IT group, at least, had set up an OA system, allowing the Executive Committee to track personnel, work progress, material reserves, and various plans. [Wen Desi][y002]'s desk was finally clear of a mountain of paperwork.

The only thing that remained unchanged was the sports equipment. The so-called "sports equipment" was, of course, a euphemism for weapons. Knives were relatively easy to obtain. Through the internet, they had acquired a motley collection: a Ming Dynasty-style infantry longsword, a few three-edged bayonets, Japanese sword-style bayonets, and an assortment of European and American combat knives. But guns were another matter. Many were experts on paper, but no one could get their hands on a real firearm.

But the world, it seems, has a way of providing.

One day, a mysterious visitor came to [Chief Wen][y002]'s office.

He was a man in his late thirties, ordinary-looking, dressed simply but elegantly. When Xi Yazhou was summoned, the man was talking with [Wen Desi][y002], and the other Executive Committee members were looking on with excitement.

*An arms dealer?* Xi Yazhou's guard went up. The committee had been discussing how to acquire weapons. Had they been so reckless as to contact someone in this line of work?

"Let me introduce you," [Wen Desi][y002] said, noticing Xi Yazhou's expression. "This is Shi Niaoren. A doctor."

"Dr. Shi, hello. I am Xi Yazhou."

"A pleasure!" Shi Niaoren said, shaking his hand. "We will be comrades-in-arms soon." He laughed.

"Dr. Shi came back from the United States specifically to participate in our operation," [Wen Desi][y002] explained. "He is the helmsman of the North American Branch."

"I wouldn't dare say that," Shi Niaoren said. "There are four of us from North America who have decided to join. Little Rui even sold his house to buy guns for everyone!"

"Buy guns!" The words sent a jolt through Xi Yazhou. He had given up hope of acquiring real firearms. Now, someone was offering to buy them modern weapons. This was a game-changer.

"Yes, buy guns." Shi Niaoren was an infectious disease doctor. He had learned about the operation online and had come back to the country to address their lack of weapons.

"Tell us about it. What kind of guns are we buying?"

"The Type 56 carbine, of course. It's cheap, and there are plenty of them." The price of SKS series semi-automatic rifles in the United States had risen, but they were still relatively inexpensive. The Yugoslavian models were less than $300, the Norinco ones $400. Gun stores were full of them.

"Can we buy AKs? Machine guns?" [Wang Luobin][y003] asked, his voice filled with excitement.

"Semi-automatic AKs, yes. But automatic weapons are out of the question," Shi Niaoren said with a hint of regret.

"No way? Are some states more lenient? There are many people in the United States who legally own automatic weapons."

"To buy automatic weapons, you need a Class 3 license and have to pay an annual tax. That's not the problem. The problem is that the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986 prohibits the sale of any automatic weapon manufactured after that date. So, the automatic weapons on the market are not only ridiculously expensive, but also old and in poor condition."

"Is that so..." Everyone was a little disappointed. They had imagined themselves armed with machine guns.

"It's okay," Xi Yazhou said. "Semi-automatic weapons are still very powerful."

"We just want to ask the Executive Committee for instructions on what kind of gun is better to buy," Shi Niaoren said. "I don't play with guns. Little Rui is more familiar, but he's not a professional. You are the experts here."

"Then let's go with the Type 56 carbine," [Wang Luobin][y003] said with some disappointment. "Most of the people here have fired it during military training and have also disassembled it. It's a familiar weapon."

"No," Xi Yazhou said, his voice firm. "The Type 56 carbine is not a good choice."
