The journey was uneventful. The *Dongshanju* left Kaohsiung for Shanghai, sold some of its cargo there, and purchased a large amount of cotton cloth and grain. Then it headed to Longkou, sold its goods there, and then turned back, stopping at several other ports along the way. By the time it finally arrived at Bopu Port in Lingao, it was already the end of January 1634.

Although Lin Ming had been thinking about Lingao for the past few years and had been constantly gathering information about it, this was his first time here. Standing on the deck, watching the port get closer and closer—the stone piers extending into the sea, as wide as streets; the tall cranes; the "automatic vehicles" running on tracks, spewing smoke and fire and pulling carriages... and finally, the short-hairs' "great iron ships"—he had originally thought these things would not surprise him too much. He had heard so many people talk about them over the years, miracles that could only be attributed to "the power of ghosts and gods." He had also secretly spied on the construction site of the Grand World in Guangzhou and had seen similar things. However, when the port under the rule of the short-haired bandits truly appeared before his eyes, his breath caught in his throat. The scene before him was a world completely beyond his comprehension.

Chimneys of all sizes spewed black smoke into the sky. White steam hissed out with the low thud of iron striking iron, lingering over the docks like a faint cloud. Cranes, pipes, and tracks crisscrossed in all directions. Whistles and steam whistles shrieked sharply, one after another.

"It's like arriving at the Lion-Camel Kingdom, a chaotic dance of demons!" Lin Ming couldn't help but have this thought.

The harbor was full of ships. The *Dongshanju* was flying the Lingao sailing flag and was not a first-time visitor. The boatswain was familiar with the procedures and quickly contacted a tugboat, which towed the *Dongshanju* to its berth.

As soon as the ship was moored, a small boat, belching black smoke, sailed towards the *Dongshanju*. The several people on board were all wearing the short-haired bandits' official uniforms. Lin Ming knew this was called a "uniform," and all those who "worked for the public" under the short-haired bandits wore it. Their arrival was a routine matter, but it was also his first test.

If he couldn't even pass this test, infiltrating Lingao to find his sister-in-law and gather intelligence would be empty talk. He might as well turn back home.

Liu Deshan and Chen Huamin, along with the main managers of the ship, were already waiting on the deck. Lin Ming pretended to be busy working by the mast, secretly watching the movements on the deck.

The short-haired bandits from the small boat boarded the ship. As the rumors said, they all had their hair shaved like monks. Perhaps they felt that being bald was not elegant, so all the "public servants" wore a hat. Some were made of rattan, like an inverted soup bowl, while others were simple cloth hats with a long brim extending in front of the forehead. To Lin Ming, it looked indescribably strange.

Their clothes were also tight-fitting, with a belt around the waist. It was clear that the "official uniforms" were all made of cloth and were of a single color. Not only was there no silk, but there were no rank badges, not even the most basic patterns. They were worse off than the yamen runners who stood guard at the yamen gate; at least their hats were decorated with a bird feather. As for decorations, the small colored cloth patches on their collars and the row of numbers sewn on their chests could barely be called that. Lin Ming knew those were Arabic numerals, and below the numbers were two Chinese characters: "Port Affairs."

As for the belt, although it was leather, it didn't look like any valuable fur, just ordinary cowhide. They exuded an air of poverty, but the black curved handle protruding from the triangular leather holster on their belts was very impressive.

Lin Ming knew that inside it was the short-haired bandits' "revolving self-generating hand cannon," a most formidable military weapon.

For such a powerful firearm to be worn on the waists of a few minor "public servants," the short-haired bandits were truly extravagant. Lin Ming thought about how since he had started working at the chiliarchy, the military equipment issued by the court was unusable. The steel of the swords and sabers he received was poor, and on some, the hilt and blade were not even firmly attached and would come apart with a slight knock. They were not as good as the decades-old items stored in the chiliarchy's warehouse. In a place like Foshan, it was not a big deal: it was a peaceful world, and even if there were some mountain bandits and pirates, the Embroidered Uniform Guard was rarely needed. Occasional official trips did not require the use of swords and guns. But his brothers in the north all complained that they had to buy their own weapons when they went on official business, otherwise they would be in trouble when it came to a life-or-death struggle.

While he was sighing, a few words of conversation between the shipowner and the short-haired bandits drifted to his ears:

"...Are there any immigrants on board?"

"No, they are all my own crew." This was Chen Huamin's voice.

Suddenly, Manager Liu's voice interjected: "Yes, there is one. Didn't that young man who boarded in Tayouan say he wanted to find a way out in Lingao?"

Lin Ming knew they were talking about him and couldn't help but curse inwardly. He had originally planned to disembark quietly and then blend into the crowd and stay behind, but he didn't expect Manager Liu to expose him directly.

He cursed "old fool" in his heart, but dared not move. He continued to pretend to be busy, his ears pricked up to listen carefully.

"Since there is an immigrant, have him come and register. We will arrange for him to disembark for quarantine in the next few days."

"Yes, I'll call him right away," Manager Liu said, then shouted, "Young man! Young..."

Lin Ming naturally couldn't pretend to be deaf. He had to put on a bewildered look and hurry over:

"Manager Liu, did you call me?"

"Young man, didn't you want to come to Lingao to find a way out? Quickly register with these gentlemen. Once you're registered, you're an immigrant. The Australians provide food and lodging," Manager Liu said with a smile.

"This..." Lin Ming cursed inwardly. He already knew the short-haired bandits' routine. If he really registered, the next step would be to enter some "re-education camp," have his head shaved, take a bath, have his buttocks spread open to check his anus, and he would have to "serve time" in there for more than a month. He would have no freedom of movement for at least two or three months. How could that be? Besides, if he shaved his head, how could he go back to Foshan? That would be ironclad proof of joining the short-hairs!

He quickly put on a smile and said, "Gentlemen, please understand! My body, hair, and skin are from my parents. I dare not shave my head. I just want to make a living in Lingao..."

One of the short-haired bandits interrupted him: "I understand what you mean! Don't worry, our Senate doesn't force people to shave their heads. It's just that if you don't shave your head, you can't join the army or get a job. I see you speak in a scholarly manner. You must be a scholar..."

Manager Liu interjected: "Your Excellency has a keen eye. This young man is well-read, can write and do arithmetic, and is also a good chess player."

The Port Affairs officer nodded. "You are a scholar, a man of culture. In a few months here, you could become a cadre. Why would you want to do hard labor or be a peddler for the sake of a few strands of hair? It's not worth it!"

Lin Ming put on a full act, wiping his eyes and saying, "Your Excellency is kind, and I understand that every word you say is golden advice. But I dare not violate the teachings of the sages. My parents passed away early. Please, Your Excellency, grant this humble one's filial piety..." As he spoke, he began to sob.

He spoke with such sincerity that he moved the other party. The Port Affairs officer waved his hand and said, "You are a grown man, what are you crying for? Since your filial piety is commendable and you are unwilling to shave your head, then don't shave it. It's all voluntary here anyway. I just think it's a pity."

Lin Ming quickly bowed his head and said, "Thank you, Your Excellency, for granting this humble one's filial piety!"

"But even if you are unwilling to shave your head, you still have to register and get a permit. Otherwise, you cannot make a living in Lingao." The Port Affairs officer said, opening his clipboard and taking out a quill pen. "First, register your name."

"Lin Min."

"Age..."

The Port Affairs officer asked about his name, age, place of origin, and where he came from, registered them one by one, had him press his fingerprint, and finally tore off a piece of paper and handed it to him:

"After the quarantine period is over, go to the Customs House within three days—" he said, pointing to the tall clock tower by the harbor, "—to the Immigration Registration Office to register and get your permit. Remember to go on time!"

"Yes, yes, I understand."

Lin Ming nodded and bowed as he took the paper. It was printed with "Temporary ID Card Application Form," and below were pre-printed formats: a string of Arabic numerals, his name already filled in, and information such as which ship he had arrived on. From the large official seal on the counterfoil, it was clear that it was a two-part form, and the top part must have been kept by the short-haired bandits' so-called "Port Affairs."

After dealing with the immigration matters, the Port Affairs officer checked the weapons and gunpowder on the ship one by one to see if they had been sealed, and spot-checked the cargo according to the manifest. Although Lingao had customs, the tariffs were very low, and many goods were duty-free, so the inspection for smuggling was not strict. After the inspection, there was the routine disinfection with medicine, but the ports the *Dongshanju* had passed through had no recent reports of epidemics, so the quarantine process was relatively simple.

Seeing the Port Affairs officer disembark, Manager Liu walked over, shaking his head. "What a pity, what a pity. They really valued you..."

"I really couldn't bear to..."

"I know, I know," Manager Liu nodded. "Everyone has their own aspirations. We can't disembark yet, so I'll have to trouble you to accompany this old man on the ship for a few more days. Your wages will be settled then."

Only then did Lin Ming know that he could not disembark yet. He had to spend several days in "quarantine," during which no one could leave the ship. They had to report the health of the personnel to the patrol boat every day. If someone fell ill, they had to report it immediately, and a doctor would be sent from the shore.

"These Australians are really kind, they even provide medical care..."

Manager Liu chuckled. "Young man, what do you know? They are afraid of spreading plagues! That's why no one is allowed to disembark. If someone really gets sick, we all have to go to the 're-education camp.' Then it doesn't matter what filial piety you have, everyone has to have their head shaved, take a bath every day, and eat thin gruel for a few months. They might even tow the ship and cargo out to sea and burn it all!"

Lin Ming was startled. "Is it really that serious?"

"Of course. So many people come and go in Lingao now, but there are very few plagues. It's all thanks to this system. Although it's a bit impersonal, it's very useful!"
