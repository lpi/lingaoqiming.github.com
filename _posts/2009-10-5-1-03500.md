In the vacuum of their long and tedious preparations, the rescue operation became a legend, a story told and retold in the evenings until it took on the burnished glow of myth. Bei Wei, Ran Yao, and Lin Shenhe were transformed overnight into heroes of the burgeoning colony, their names spoken with a new reverence. Strangers greeted them like brothers, their every move watched with an admiration that was both gratifying and unnerving.

The subject of this daring rescue, [Wen Desi][y002], was subjected to a thorough medical examination and pronounced, to the surprise of some, healthier than any of his rescuers. His losses were trivial, though his anti-stab vest and stun gun sparked the colonists' imagination. The vest became the "celestial silk armor," a relic of impossible technology, while some even suggested the Executive Committee could sell them for a king's ransom.

The mood in the Executive Committee, however, was far from celebratory. They knew the vest was useless against a bullet and the stun gun a dead piece of plastic without its charger. Their concern was not for lost gadgets, but for a single piece of paper recovered from the body of the bandit leader. Amidst the mundane collection of silver, copper, and flint, they had found a letter. Its contents were innocuous—a simple inquiry about the sale of goods—but the signature chilled them: "Respectfully, Zhou Rui of Min'an."

The name would have meant nothing had it not been for Yu E'shui, a young history graduate student who had joined their expedition. He recognized the name instantly. Zhou Rui, he explained to the somber committee, was likely an "adopted son" of Zheng Cai, a cousin—or perhaps a nephew—of the most powerful pirate lord on the China coast: Zheng Zhilong.

The "adopted son" system, Yu explained, was a cornerstone of Chinese maritime enterprise. Powerful families would raise these men, bound by debt and obligation, to serve as their lifelong factors and captains, braving the treacherous seas while the true sons enjoyed the profits in safety. And the Zheng clan was the most powerful of them all. Zheng Cai himself was a major figure in the organization, a man who would later command his own faction and contend with the great Koxinga for control of the seas.

The implication was stark and unavoidable. Before they had even sold their first crate of goods, they had made an enemy of the largest and most dangerous maritime power in the late Ming Empire.

It was Yu E'shui who offered a dose of cold, pragmatic comfort. "You are worrying about the inevitable," he told the grim-faced committee. "The seas of Guangdong and Fujian are a hornet's nest of pirates and smugglers. The Zheng, the Dutch, the Portuguese... it is a paradise of jungle law. To survive here, we must eventually face them all. It matters little whether it is sooner or later. These men respect only one thing: strength. This battle was not a disaster; it was a message. It has shown them that we are not to be trifled with. It may even buy us a measure of peace."

His logic was sound, yet the Committee took no chances. The Guangzhou outpost was placed on high alert. The residence was fortified with iron bars and security doors, and a small arsenal of fire extinguishers was stockpiled against the threat of arson.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] paid a visit to Gao Ju, their local contact, and gave him a carefully edited account of the events. The merchant was stunned. He had never imagined the Australians possessed such capabilities, that they could resolve such a perilous situation so cleanly, and in a city where they were strangers. He had held back, waiting for them to beg for his help, hoping to indebt them to him. Now, he was filled with a profound and bitter regret. When [Xiao Zishan][y001] asked for his help in securing a new, more defensible residence, Gao Ju agreed with an alacrity that bordered on desperation, even offering to pay for the house himself as a gift to soothe [Master Wen][y002]'s frayed nerves. [Xiao Zishan][y001], with a practiced show of reluctance, graciously accepted.

It was then that Gao Ju produced a list.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] scanned the items: ten thousand cigarettes, two hundred lighters, an assortment of mirrors, and other novelties. "What is this?"

"A small tribute," Gao Ju sighed, his face a mask of pain, "for a certain personage in the capital. It is urgent. Can you deliver it within ten days?"

"Of course," [Xiao Zishan][y001] agreed readily. The order was large, worth nearly twenty thousand taels of silver, but the goods were common enough. The real question was the recipient. An opportunity was presenting itself. "We can certainly provide some novelties of our own," he offered casually. "What are the great official's particular tastes? It is always best to cater to a man's passions."

"My worthy brother is too kind," Gao Ju said with a bitter smile. "These items are what they have specifically requested."

*So damn corrupt,* [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought. Not just accepting bribes, but soliciting them with a shopping list. "But why so many?"

"It is not so many, when you consider the two in the palace, the twenty-four offices, the grand secretaries of the cabinet..." Gao Ju trailed off. "Ah, I forget you are not a subject of the Great Ming. It is... complicated."

The scale of the bribe was staggering. Gao Ju's connections ran deeper than he had imagined. He decided to probe. "Could this official," he asked in a low voice, "be the Nine Thousand Year Old?"

Gao Ju started, his eyes darting around the room. "Be careful with your words! It is not the Director of the Eastern Depot, but another." He leaned closer. "How do you know of the Nine Thousand Year Old?"

"One hears things," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, affecting an air of mystery.

Gao Ju took the bait. "The business I am in," he sighed, "has survived only through the patronage of a certain Eunuch Yang in the palace." He explained the relationship in brief, omitting the details of profit-sharing, but the implication was clear. "But now, his position is precarious. He is not favored by the Director of the Eastern Depot."

"So this tribute is to win back favor?"

"Favor? I dare not hope for such a thing. We are merely burning incense in all directions, praying for peace." Gao Ju wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. "Eunuch Yang and I are in the same boat. I must do what I can to aid him."

"I understand, brother."

"There is one more matter," Gao Ju said, his hands clasped in a gesture of supplication.

"Of course." [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s internal alarms began to sound.

"I find myself in a difficult position. My funds... may be tight."

*Damn it.*

"...I was hoping you might persuade your fellow shopkeepers to switch to a monthly settlement of our accounts. If you could arrange this, I would be eternally grateful."

So that was the play. Credit. And a bribe to secure it. It was not an unreasonable request in this era, where payment could take years, if it came at all. But their own venture was a desperate race for capital. Extending credit was a risk the Committee was unlikely to accept.

He saw it then, the entire conversation laid bare. Every word, every gesture from Gao Ju had been a carefully calculated move, steering him inexorably to this point. The old fox.

"Is this a great difficulty for you, my brother?" Gao Ju asked, his eyes sharp.

"It will require... careful consideration," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, playing along. "But to extend such credit, we would need to understand the reason for this... difficulty."

After a moment's hesitation, Gao Ju confessed everything. A certain Yang Tianliang had come to Guangzhou to discuss the construction of a living shrine to the Nine Thousand Year Old, Wei Zhongxian.

"The shrine itself would be a small matter," Gao Ju said, his face twitching with the thought of the expense. "Five thousand taels would suffice. But Eunuch Yang wishes it to be 'grand and magnificent.' He wishes to mobilize the merchants and citizens of Guangzhou. The cost... it will be no less than eighty thousand taels."

[Xiao Zishan][y001]'s knowledge of Wei Zhongxian's living shrines came from a high school textbook. He didn't know or care if one had ever been built in Guangzhou. But he knew intelligence when he saw it. This was a matter for the Executive Committee, and for their resident historian. There might be a way to exploit this situation, a way to turn the troubles of a corrupt merchant to their own advantage.
