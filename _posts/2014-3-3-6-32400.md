Lin Ming laughed it off. Since Wang Xinglong was insistent on going, he couldn't spoil the mood. The two walked together, heading towards the Wenlan River. Lin Ming guessed that the place Wang Xinglong was taking him to was that "Heyuan Street."

Halfway there, a heavy rain suddenly began to fall. The two found a teahouse by the road, ordered a pot of tea, and sat leisurely to wait out the rain, taking the opportunity to have dinner. The teahouse also sold various snacks. Wang Xinglong ordered a bowl of Lingao rice noodles, asking for some extra beef. Seeing that Lin Ming wasn't eating, he asked:

"Aren't you hungry, Brother Lin?"

"Since we're going to a brothel, there will be plenty to eat, and it will surely be much more refined than this."

In the Ming Dynasty, brothels were not just places for prostitution but also social venues, and their food and drink were considered to be at the forefront of "fashion."

"Brother Lin, how could we afford the food at a brothel?" Wang Xinglong shook his head. "A cup of tea there costs more than a glass of wine outside."

Back in Guangdong, he never paid when he went to brothels. In Foshan, it went without saying; they were eager to have him. Even in other places, some wealthy merchant would always foot the bill.

"You're right, my dear brother. I was muddled for a moment."

"From the looks of you, Brother Lin, you must have been quite well-off back on the mainland," Wang Xinglong chuckled.

"You flatter me, you flatter me," Lin Ming forced a smile. "The past is not worth looking back on."

"Why be embarrassed, Brother Lin? Here in Lingao, how many people came here to make a living only after they were desperate and had nowhere else to turn..." As Wang Xinglong was speaking, the steaming hot rice noodles were brought over. The slightly yellow noodles floated in an oily broth, topped with slices of beef, pickled vegetables, peanuts, shrimp, and other ingredients. It looked full and appetizing.

"You should have a bowl too, Brother Lin. This is a local specialty." Wang Xinglong picked up the vinegar pot from the table and poured a generous amount in. Then he opened a porcelain jar and scooped out several spoonfuls of a glistening, crimson sauce into his bowl, stirring it in.

The air immediately filled with a fragrant, sour, and pungent aroma. Lin Ming's mind stirred slightly, remembering the spicy boiled pork slices he had eaten during his trip to Macau, which had a similar stimulating fragrance.

"This is chili sauce, a new thing brought by the Australians. It whets the appetite and goes well with food."

Lin Ming also ordered a bowl of rice noodles. After they finished eating, the rain had stopped. The streets, which had been flowing with water, were now surprisingly drained and clean. Although the road surface was damp, there was not a single puddle, which secretly amazed Lin Ming. Even in a prosperous city like Foshan, where the streets were paved with flagstones, the rainwater never drained completely after a storm. The low-lying alleys and small streets would be filled with puddles and become muddy.

By the time they were back on the street, the lanterns were already lit. The two walked at a leisurely pace. As the host, Wang Xinglong constantly pointed out the shops and scenery along the way, providing explanations. He also explained some of the facilities that Lin Ming didn't understand. Many things were indeed beyond Lin Ming's expectations: the meticulous planning of the town by the short-hairs and their abundant financial resources secretly astonished him. He discovered that the short-hairs were more willing to spend money on the small, unseen, and unnoticed details.

Looking at Wang Xinglong's proud expression, Lin Ming suddenly felt like a country bumpkin being shown around the city for the first time by his city relative.

Due to the rain, there were not many pedestrians on the street. However, Lin Ming noticed that the atmosphere on the street was clearly tense. There were short-hair police officers standing guard at major intersections. Besides the police, there were also soldiers armed with rifles, occasionally checking pedestrians, as if a major crime had occurred.

"Has there been a major case?" Lin Ming asked in a low voice.

"Why, don't you read the newspaper?" Wang Xinglong asked with some surprise, then he smiled. "Oh, right, Brother Lin just arrived."

"Read the newspaper? The official gazette?"

"This isn't the Great Ming, where would you find an official gazette," Wang Xinglong said carelessly. "It's the *Lingao Times*. It reports on local news and information. Our shop subscribes to it, but Shopkeeper Qian probably took it. It's already been reported: some of the flying thieves from last night are still at large, and they're conducting a city-wide manhunt."

"I see." Lin Ming thought to himself that he must read this newspaper. It would be much more convenient to gather information this way, without having to ask around. He was very concerned about the matter of the flying thieves and couldn't wait to get back to read the paper, so he asked, "Did the gazette... the newspaper say where that gang of flying thieves came from?"

"It didn't say, but there were a lot of details: it said there were thirty of them in total, all highly skilled martial artists from the jianghu, some of them even notorious old thieves with established names," Wang Xinglong, seizing the opportunity to show off, said with great enthusiasm. "They sneaked into Lingao in several groups. But they didn't expect to fall into the police's sights as soon as they arrived."

Wang Xinglong, eager to show off, embellished the story with great relish. Lin Ming listened carefully to the whole story. It didn't sound like they had any official background, which made him secretly sigh with relief. His greatest fear was having colleagues come to Lingao. He had met almost all the mid-to-low-level personnel of the Jinyiwei in Guangdong, and it would be disastrous if there was an acquaintance among them.

The two chatted as they walked, reaching Heyuan Street without any hindrance.

The street was still hung with pink lanterns, the rosy light casting an indescribable charm on the flagstone path. Wang Xinglong, familiar with the place, led him inside. Lin Ming saw that the street was not wide, only enough for two "Australian carts" to pass side by side.

One side of the street was the sandy and gravelly bank of the Wenlan River. The earthen embankment was planted with peach, willow, and apricot trees. Lingao was warm in winter, and green buds were already sprouting, the branches full of flower buds. The other side was lined with two-story buildings, packed tightly together, much like the streets of Dongmen Market. However, there were no clerks greeting customers at the doorways, making it seem rather quiet.

The doorways were hung with curtains, and the signboards were all of a uniform style, probably made in the same place. Besides the identical pink lanterns, there was also a yellow wooden plaque that read: "Business License for the Customs Industry." Below that were categories like Class A, Class B, Class C, followed by Arabic numerals. There were no pimps or prostitutes at the doors soliciting customers. Instead, there were half-height signboards with various terms he didn't understand: "Poison Dragon Drill," "Ice and Fire Five Heavens," "Heavenly Maiden Scatters Flowers"... he had no idea what they meant. Next to them were other boards displaying rows of small portraits of the prostitutes, a dense and spectacular sight.

"Hey, Quan Dao, what do you think of the girls in this house? Is their service anything special?"

"No way, not even close. I'll take you to see what's truly heavenly. That woman's meat buns are... come on, come on, it's just ahead." A man in short-hair-style clothing pulled another man, walking quickly forward.

"Meat buns? Woman? Service?" Lin Ming caught only a few words. He was secretly suspicious. This brothel district was too strange. Was this an Australian custom? As for the word "special," he had no idea what it meant.

There were many people on the street, in groups of three or five, talking and laughing loudly. Some went straight to their destination, while others hesitated, looking from one establishment to another. Occasionally, there were a few drunkards, staggering about, some even vomiting on the stone benches by the roadside. Besides the pleasure-seekers, there were also many rickshaws waiting for customers, and food vendors had set up stalls nearby.

He could see that although there were many people doing business here, the order was very good, and the ground was very clean. Lin Ming took another look and understood. It turned out there were police on duty here as well. In a tall, two-story sentry box, several police officers were on watch. Next to it was a set of stocks, with a few unlucky souls locked in chains.

As Lin Ming was engrossed in the sight, Wang Xinglong patted him on the back. "What do you think? You've never seen a red-light district like this before, have you?"

"It's an eye-opener, a real eye-opener," Lin Ming nodded repeatedly. He saw a facility that looked like a road sign, with the words "Call Station" written on it. A few heavily made-up women sat below. He could tell they were of average looks and not very young. They were prostitutes, but they didn't solicit customers, just sat there silently. Each wore a yellow paper card on her chest. He asked in a low voice, "Are these also..."

"Yes, these are individual businesses," Wang Xinglong's speech was peppered with new terms. "The brothels are company entities."

"What?"

"To put it simply, the brothels are established shops with names, and these are the small vendors."

"I see." Lin Ming found it incredible. "Is it really that simple? Can a business of selling favors work without a madam or a pimp?"

"Unlicensed prostitution is not allowed here. You have to be registered and licensed, otherwise it's 'illegal prostitution,' and if you get caught, you'll be sent to sift sand. As for what you mentioned, it's completely unnecessary. Business here is very peaceful, and the flesh trade is no exception," Wang Xinglong said with a smile. "However, the taxes are not light."

Lin Ming cursed silently: The short-hairs are truly shameless. The government actually collects whores' flesh money. He felt a bit of contempt. But this was a huge source of income! He had a deep understanding of city life and was familiar with the inner workings of various businesses. He knew that although the flesh trade was a lowly and despised profession, it was extremely profitable. With the short-hairs' perverted shrewdness, they naturally wouldn't let go of this fat piece of meat.

"Here, you can spend as much or as little as you like. The rich can naturally go to the brothels; the poor can take one of the street-side girls to a hotel for a quick release," Wang Xinglong continued. "The Australians also give the courtesans monthly health checks and treat them if they're sick. It's truly a benevolent act..."

Lin Ming cursed inwardly: "What kind of benevolent act is this? It's just a way to make money!" He was beginning to understand the short-hairs' way of thinking. The Ming government's approach to cities and commerce was extensive and hands-off; as long as there were no major incidents, they wouldn't interfere. Many things that could be very profitable were never undertaken by anyone. But the short-hairs were meticulous about everything, managing every detail, no matter how small.

No wonder that from the tiny area of Dongmen Market, in just five years, they had been able to sweep across Fujian and Guangdong and shake the seas. Besides possessing countless strange and ingenious technologies, it was this all-pervasive method of managing their territory. Where else in the world could compare?

While he was lost in thought, Wang Xinglong had already stopped. "Let's choose this one for today."
