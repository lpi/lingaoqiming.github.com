The online discussions were a whirlwind of activity, covering everything from the logistics of the transmigration to the political and social structure of their new world.

Parliamentary democracy? Separation of powers? Constitutional monarchy? Totalitarianism? Nationalism? Socialism?

Everyone wanted to be the architect of a new society.

The debates were fierce. To rewrite history, to overthrow the Ming and topple the Qing—that was the dream. But what kind of world would they build? Democracy versus dictatorship, peace versus militarism, parliament versus centralism... the arguments raged, descending into debates over clothing styles, compulsory education, the language of military drills, and even the system of nobility. It was a chaotic storm of ideas, insults, and ideologies.

The Executive Committee remained aloof, observing the chaos without comment. Let them argue, they reasoned. Better to have it out now than on the beaches of Hainan. Besides, the anonymity of the internet had a way of revealing people's true colors, a useful tool for identifying potential core personnel.

The Executive Committee itself had been formed through a rather informal process. There had been no elections, no general meetings. To a modern observer, it might have seemed undemocratic. But the reality was that the group was in constant flux. An active participant one day might be gone the next, replaced by a new face. It had taken [Xiao Zishan][y001] nearly half a year to compile a reasonably accurate list of members. In such a volatile environment, the three men who had been orchestrating the preparations from the beginning—[Wen Desi][y002], [Xiao Zishan][y001], and [Wang Luobin][y003]—had naturally become the core of the Executive Committee.

They were in no hurry to expand their ranks. Despite their different backgrounds, they shared a tacit understanding. When some of the more eager members demanded to be brought into the fold, the committee's response was a unanimous "not yet." They knew that the more capital they controlled, the more power they would wield in the new world.

Seniority, [Xiao Zishan][y001] believed, was a valuable asset. It conferred a certain weight, a certain prestige. To bring in new members too early would be to grant them a status they hadn't earned, which could be detrimental to their future plans.

[Wen Desi][y002]'s reasoning was more practical. The world was full of braggarts and fools, men who were more adept at ruining things than building them. Time, he knew, was the best filter. It would wear away their fleeting enthusiasm, leaving only the truly dedicated.

But they couldn't wait forever. The preparations required a wide range of skills, more than the three of them possessed. They needed fresh blood. After a brief meeting, they decided to make one more trip to the past, to secure the funds they needed to begin the next phase of their operation.

"My master has given instructions," a manager said, bowing respectfully. "When you esteemed gentlemen arrive, please change your clothes first. The master will be out shortly."

He led them into a small, exquisite courtyard, lush with flowers and trees. On a table sat a set of clothes, towels, shoes, and hats.

They didn't know it, but Master Gao had gifted the powder boxes and other strange objects to a dozen of his high-ranking contacts, causing a sensation throughout Guangzhou. Glass mirrors were a rarity, something most people had only heard of. And the boxes themselves were a marvel. His shop was mobbed with buyers. A powder box that had cost him ten taels was now selling for fifty, and they were still flying off the shelves.

In his twenty years of dealing in foreign goods, Master Gao had never been so popular. His colleagues, all seasoned maritime traders, were desperate to know the source of his new wares. They knew that neither the Franks, the Red Hairs, nor the English had such goods, and it wasn't their shipping season.

A new overseas merchant had come to Guangzhou, and Master Gao had him all to himself. The number of suspicious characters loitering around his residence and shop had increased, and he had grown cautious. He had even postponed the matter of buying a house for [Wen Desi][y002].

But now, he could no longer afford to be cautious. The pursuit of profit was a merchant's greatest instinct. His main concern was that the Australians were too conspicuous. He couldn't risk his new source of wealth being discovered.

[Wen Desi][y002] and [Wang Luobin][y003] exchanged a look. They understood Master Gao's motives. Anonymity suited their purposes as well. They agreed to change.

But dressing in Ming Dynasty clothes was no easy task. They were not Hanfu enthusiasts. After a long struggle, they managed to put on the clothes, albeit clumsily. The manager returned with tea and, seeing their disheveled state, summoned a pair of maids to assist them.

The wealthy families of Guangdong often kept maids, and these were clearly chosen to impress. They were fifteen or sixteen, with bright eyes and delicate features. They curtsied gracefully and began to undo the men's clumsy work. [Chief Wen][y002], a man who considered himself worldly, was flustered by the soft touch of the young girls' hands. *This,* he thought, *is a man's paradise.*

He glanced over at [Xiao Zishan][y001], who was also looking rather entranced. "Tempted?" he whispered.

"This is the life a man should live," [Xiao Zishan][y001] replied, thinking of his domineering ex-girlfriend. Feudal society, he mused, had its bright side.

"You bet!" [Wang Luobin][y003] chimed in. "Modern society is a collapse of rites and music." He then launched into a tirade about his wife, a physical education graduate, his resentment palpable.

The two maids stood by, trying to stifle their giggles as [Wang Luobin][y003] gestured wildly, his newly straightened scarf now askew on his forehead.

"[Engineer Wang][y003]," [Xiao Zishan][y001] teased, "what do you think of this little maid? Should we ask Master Gao to let you take her back?"

[Wang Luobin][y003] shook his head vigorously. "She's a junior high school student! I couldn't!"

"So you could if she were in high school?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] pressed. "Just raise her for a few years, and she'll be ripe..."

"Planning a loli-raising simulation?" [Wen Desi][y002] added. "I'm interested." He eyed the girls. They were a bit thin, but with some proper nutrition...

As the three "gray wolves" were eyeing the "little white rabbits," the curtain was lifted, and Master Gao entered, a dignified air about him. He saw the scene and smiled. Sea merchants were a lusty bunch. When they came ashore, they were like starved ghosts. The Red Hairs and the Franks would take any woman they could get their hands on.

He said nothing, however, simply cupped his hands in a salute. "Esteemed guests, have you been well?"
