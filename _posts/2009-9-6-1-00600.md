That evening, the three men who had completed their first journey through time and space held their first work summary meeting. Meeting minutes were taken according to formal meeting procedures. In [Wen Desi][y002]'s words: "We are making history."

At the meeting, various issues encountered during the transmigration were summarized and concluded. The conclusion was: they had been too contemptuous of the wisdom of the ancients, had not done enough homework, knew too little about the Ming Dynasty, and had relied too much on assumptions.

Overall, their luck was good, and they had quite smoothly found a reasonably suitable agent.

As for the next trade plan, although the prices were unexpectedly low, a careful calculation showed that the profit was not as low as they had imagined.

One tael of silver in the Ming Dynasty was equivalent to about 37.3 grams. Although the purchase price of silver in their own time fluctuated, it was only about 3 yuan per gram (with a selling price of 3.6-3.8 yuan and a purchase price of 2-2.6 yuan, they took a slightly higher price). One tael of silver could be exchanged for 112 RMB. In reality, considering the cost of "fire loss"—much of the silver circulating in the Ming Dynasty was of low purity and needed to be re-melted—the return would be even lower.

If a powder box could be sold for ten taels, it meant they could get about 1000 yuan. [Xiao Zishan][y001] had brought over 200 powder boxes. This item alone could bring in two thousand taels of silver, equivalent to two hundred thousand yuan. Even if they had to purchase these powder boxes, the current wholesale price was only a few yuan each, making the cost almost negligible.

"Actually, we can do another round of arbitrage," [Xiao Zishan][y001] scribbled with his pen for a while. "I remember the gold-to-silver price ratio in the late Ming was about one to ten. With these two thousand taels of silver, we can ask for it to be converted into gold. We could get two hundred taels, totaling 7460 grams. Calculated at 150 yuan per gram, that's over a million yuan. That's more profitable than selling the goods."

"But generally speaking, the stock of gold in society is limited, so we won't be able to exchange much," [Wang Luobin][y003] felt it was a bit of a pity.

"Actually, we can ask for another thing as payment, something more valuable than gold," [Wen Desi][y002] said.

"What is it?"

"Porcelain." [Wen Desi][y002] pointed to a Christie's auction announcement in a newspaper. "Ming Dynasty porcelain, I don't need to say more..."

When the pale-faced servant ran to the study, Master Gao knew that the three Australians had come again. This time it was late at night, and just like last time, they had appeared out of thin air in the warehouse yard.

If they hadn't come during the day last time, and left in broad daylight, Master Gao would have really suspected them of being some kind of ghosts or demons.

"Master Gao, these are the goods."

Under the eaves of the study, there were four or five cardboard boxes that the servants had moved from the warehouse yard. It was the first time he had seen paper used as cargo boxes, and his heart couldn't help but beat wildly. Although he had secretly sprinkled chicken blood on those samples a few days ago, and when he looked at them the next day, the things were still fine and hadn't turned into clay puppets, he was only then relieved.

"Manager Yan, count and make a list," Master Gao ordered his men.

"Yes, master."

The manager led the servants to open the cardboard boxes. Each item was wrapped in that exquisite paper box, neatly stacked. Master Gao nodded. These Australian merchants were really extravagant—just the packaging probably cost a lot of money.

The three men sat on chairs, watching the Gao family's servants count. Under the dim candlelight, Master Gao's Nanjing satin robe shimmered slightly. [Xiao Zishan][y001] inexplicably thought of burial clothes, and goosebumps rose on his skin.

Fortunately, they had prepared a special gift. After the counting was finished and both sides had confirmed the numbers, [Wen Desi][y002] opened a box and took out a kerosene lamp. It had taken them a lot of time to buy this from a craft store for 120 yuan, the most expensive of all their items. [Wen Desi][y002] took out a can of kerosene from the box, poured it in, and lit a flame with a nearby candle. Before long, the lamp flame grew brighter, and the originally dim study was instantly illuminated.

Master Gao and his servants were all dumbfounded. Of all the things the Australian sea merchants had brought these days, none had left such a deep impression on them as this.

"This is a kerosene lamp, a small token."

"What a marvelous object!" Master Gao also walked a few steps closer. A ball of white flame, dazzlingly bright, with a fully transparent glass lampshade outside. He turned his head and asked, "Is this object produced in your esteemed country? What is its value?"

[Xiao Zishan][y001] couldn't help but sigh at humanity's desire for light. The things they thought would surprise the ancients hadn't caused much of a stir. Instead, it was this kerosene lamp, already obsolete in modern society, that had shaken them—simply because it was much brighter than candles and oil lamps. If Master Gao could see an electric light?! [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s confidence in their future transmigration plan was instantly filled.

"It is indeed produced in our country," [Wen Desi][y002] smiled like a treacherous merchant. "Two hundred taels will suffice."

"Marvelous object, marvelous object!" Master Gao circled the lamp in fascination, looking at it again and again. He then mimicked [Wen Desi][y002]'s action of turning the knob to adjust the flame, seeing the light brighten and dim as he wished. He was secretly amazed. He knew that although this thing had a strange shape and an expensive glass cover, it was essentially the same as the oil lamps used by poor families. However, its light was more than ten times brighter, it had no oily smell or smoke, and the brightness could be adjusted. Were the skilled craftsmen of Australia all reincarnations of Lu Ban?

Suddenly remembering something, he asked again, "The oil this lamp uses—um, kerosene, is it also produced in Australia?"

[Xiao Zishan][y001] nodded. This Master Gao was truly a smart man, able to see the key point at a glance.

"Indeed."

"The price of the oil?"

"Ten taels a bottle." A bottle was actually just one liter. For now, they didn't plan to engage in large-scale kerosene trade, so it was fine to sell it at a higher price, leaving some room for the future. (8.5 yuan/liter was the quoted price for lamp kerosene in Shanghai).

"The lamp is a good lamp, but the oil..." Master Gao showed a look of regret.

"A bottle of oil can burn for more than ten shichen (20 hours). A month would only cost ten or twenty taels of silver, which is not too expensive."

"If the oil were cheaper, I could sell a lot of this item..." Master Gao was unwilling to give up.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] just laughed and didn't take the bait. Master Gao knew that this group of Australian sea merchants was not going to budge. However, having received this lamp for free, along with the twelve bottles of kerosene that came with it, was a huge benefit. He thought, maybe it would work with vegetable oil, he would try it tomorrow.

At that moment, [Xiao Zishan][y001] demonstrated how to assemble, disassemble, maintain, and fill the lamp. Gao Ju ordered a young servant to watch and learn, and then do it a few times himself. Seeing that there were no mistakes, he then calculated the price according to the list.

The payment for the goods, according to the price they had agreed upon, came to a total of more than three thousand taels of silver. [Xiao Zishan][y001] requested that one thousand and five taels of it be converted into gold. Master Gao shook his head repeatedly, saying that there was no place to exchange for gold at night, and he himself only had fifty or sixty taels of gold on hand. In the end, sixty taels of gold were used to replace six hundred taels of silver.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] then proposed to buy porcelain, which did not surprise Master Gao. Overseas merchants all liked to buy porcelain. It was not difficult either; his warehouse was full of it. He ordered someone to bring over a few baskets of export porcelain.

Opening the straw rope wrapping, he took out a few pieces to inspect. Based on the few books on porcelain that [Xiao Zishan][y001] had crammed, he recognized that this was the so-called "Kraak porcelain," a representative type of export porcelain from the late Ming Dynasty.

How much could this porcelain sell for now? An ordinary plate would not be less than a few thousand RMB. On December 10, 2005, 214 pieces of Kraak porcelain salvaged from the South China Sea by the Swede Sten Sjostrand from the "Ming Wanli" and "Qing Desaru" shipwrecks were auctioned at China Guardian's special auction. Although the glaze of the porcelain was severely corroded and even peeled off due to long-term immersion in water, it still achieved a sales rate of 92% and a total turnover of 2.727 million yuan. One of the Ming Wanli blue-and-white lotus-petal-shaped openwork flower-and-bird plates was sold for 55,000 yuan.

At this moment, there were several large baskets full of brand-new Kraak porcelain right before their eyes!

Buying these porcelains cost less than twenty taels of silver. [Xiao Zishan][y001] and the others all thought it was a bargain, while Master Gao secretly laughed at these sea merchants for not knowing the market. Both sides felt they had gotten a great deal.

Before leaving, [Wen Desi][y002] left two hundred taels of silver and asked Master Gao to purchase a house nearby for them to use as a base. According to the plan, the exit of the wormhole in this time and space would be temporarily located there. Master Gao agreed to everything.

After the Australian sea merchants left, Master Gao thought for a long time alone in his study, even sending away the concubine who had come to invite him to rest. Buying a house was naturally not a big deal for him, but the unknown identity of these people still made him a little worried. After pacing a few circles, he called his manager and ordered that the matter of the Australian sea merchants not be leaked. He also asked him to make a list of all the servants, pages, and maids who knew about this matter. If the news leaked, there would be a strict investigation and severe punishment.

[Note: The knowledge about Kraak porcelain comes from Mr. Ma Weidu's book.]
