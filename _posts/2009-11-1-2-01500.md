"No need for that. We're all brothers here, right, Brother Li?"

"Don't get so familiar with me," Li Jun said, taking out a piece of chewing gum as a substitute for brushing his teeth and avoiding Little Wei's greedy hand. "You're in your early twenties, two years older than I was when I was a soldier in the mobile squadron. You were supposed to be on duty but you were sleeping. In the army, you would have been beaten by the squad leader long ago. How can you have the nerve to say that?"

"The situation is different. We're not the army..."

"Bullshit. The Executive Committee is using us as an army. Didn't you tell Xi Yazhou and Bei Wei that you love being a soldier and fighting? Sleeping on duty, hehe..."

"Shh, don't talk, there's a situation!" Bei Wei waved his hand, and the two of them quickly crawled over and squatted by the edge of the pit.

The morning mist gradually dissipated. Pedestrians began to appear on the post road outside the city, coming into the city in twos and threes, carrying loads on poles, driving pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks, and supporting the old and young.

"What are they going into the city for? Is it market day today?" Wei Aiwen found it strange to see the endless stream of people on the post road.

"They are refugees, seeking shelter in the city."

"Refugees? Are the Japanese coming?"

For a moment, Bei Wei had difficulty understanding Little Wei's train of thought. "The Japanese? Where would the Japanese come from?"

"Weren't there always Japanese pirates in the Ming Dynasty..."

"These people are fleeing from us," Li Yunxing said, looking at the crowd of ragged, indistinct figures on the post road. A chill went down his spine. *Can we really communicate with the people of the Ming Dynasty in 1628?*

"We haven't done anything wrong," Little Wei said, his understanding still that of a modern person.

"Maybe the rumors in the city are already saying that we are green-faced, tusked, non-human creatures that eat children and molest old women..."

As they were talking, they suddenly saw the common people on the road dodging to the sides. A group of people came up the post road, surrounding three two-wheeled handcarts. The one in the lead wore an iron helmet and armor, with a long saber at his waist. He was a military officer.

"They look like Ming soldiers," Bei Wei said as he silently counted the number of people passing by. One, five, ten...

Not counting the leader, there were thirty men in total, and two handcarts. Because they were mixed in with the crowd, he couldn't see clearly what was on them, but from the number of people pushing the carts and their posture, the things on the carts were very heavy.

"They are Ming soldiers, all carrying weapons." Through the binoculars, the group looked neat and tidy, but except for three or four men, no one wore armor. The ones in better condition had helmets. Each man carried a long spear.

The handcarts also became clear. The first one had an iron cannon mounted on it, dark and heavy, but he estimated it was at the level of a three-pounder. The cart behind it was loaded with boxes and jars, probably ammunition.

"Little Wei, take pictures!"

Wei Aiwen raised his digital camera and took a series of shots with the telephoto lens, capturing the procession, the soldiers, the cannon, and even close-up photos of the leading officer and the few armored soldiers.

"Look!" Li Yunxing suddenly cried out, his voice so loud it startled everyone around him. "There's a foreigner!"

Bei Wei adjusted his direction of observation. Sure enough, at the end of the procession was a disheveled foreigner with conspicuous brown hair. His hands were tied behind his back with a rope, and he was being dragged along. He was barefoot, his calves were bleeding, and he was wearing half of a fisherman's straw cloak. A young soldier behind him kept prodding his buttocks with a spear to make him walk faster.

A merchant? A missionary? A pirate? A series of question marks flashed through Bei Wei's mind. It wasn't strange to see foreigners on the coast of Guangdong and Fujian in the Ming Dynasty, but how did this guy get captured and brought to Lingao County? Was he a foreign pirate?

"Get me the command post."

As the sun was rising, the Ming family and the trio of Chinese-American agents were gathered on the beach outside the camp, looking bewildered.

After waking up and having breakfast, [Xiao Zishan][y001], who had been spouting nonsense about them being in the Ming Dynasty, came over. The Ming family, who had had enough of his ramblings, thought he was having another fit, but unexpectedly, he very politely said that they had decided to let them go.

Before they could react, a transport boat had taken them and their luggage to the shore.

The camp on the beach, the ships in the harbor, the vehicles and machinery running back and forth on the sand, the soldiers carrying guns... all of it seemed so unreal. These bandits were truly audacious. If it weren't for the bay, the family would have thought they had ended up in the legendary Golden Triangle.

"You see, all the luggage is here, untouched. You can check it," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a beaming smile to the still-dazed family.

Ming Lang was about to bend down to open the zipper of his luggage but was stopped by his mother. She smiled at [Xiao Zishan][y001] and said, "We trust you, we trust you."

"Where is this place? You can't just drop us off without telling us where we are," the pretty policewoman spoke up.

The old woman quickly interrupted her daughter-in-law. "No need, no need. Little comrade, just tell us which direction to walk to get to a main road. This place looks too desolate. We need a direction to walk, don't we?"

"Ma'am, didn't I tell you yesterday? This is Bopu Port in Lingao County. This river is the Wenlan River. There are no highways. If you walk upstream along the river, it's not far to Lingao county town—but it's the Lingao county town of the Ming Dynasty." Even as [Xiao Zishan][y001] said this, he felt like he was going crazy himself.

The old man sneered, "My god, Bopu? You might as well say this is New York."

"You see, I'm really not lying to you." [Xiao Zishan][y001] was used to being cursed at yesterday. He pointed a finger at the beacon tower. "Isn't that the beacon tower of Lingao? And over there is Lingao Cape. Old sir, you served in the army in Hainan. You should know this place."

"Lingao Cape? Then where's the lighthouse? Where did the monument disappear to? Did you eat it?"

(The two major landmarks on Lingao Cape: the customs lighthouse built during the Guangxu era, and the monument to the liberation of Hainan.)

"Isn't this 1628? Our great People's Liberation Army hasn't come to cross the sea and liberate Hainan yet."

The old man had a look of disdain and was about to say more, but his wife pushed him, and he had to shut up.

"Bopu it is, then. Thank you. We'll be on our way now. Please go back," the old woman said, trying to smooth things over. [Xiao Zishan][y001] smiled, and only when Guo Yi and his group were also brought over did he say to them:

"This is Comrade Guo from Section X of Public Security. He happens to be accompanying two foreign guests. You can all walk together and look out for each other."

The Ming family became nervous, unable to guess what [Xiao Zishan][y001] was up to. As for Little Guo and his group, they were also a bit baffled by this family. This morning, Ran Yao had led people to take them off the ship. All along the way, he thought the guy was going to do something sinister. At first, he thought he would be shot in the back on the deck. Then, on the transport boat, he prepared to be dumped overboard. On the beach, he thought he would face a firing squad and die a heroic death. But instead, he saw a family of old and young, with large and small boxes and luggage bags.

"Little Guo, you can go with Old Mr. Ming's family. Just follow the river, and you'll reach Lingao county town," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, looking at the two groups, each eyeing the other with distrust. He couldn't help but find it amusing. That guy Yu E'shui was really vicious. But thinking about what this group might encounter on the road to Lingao, he couldn't really laugh. He hoped everyone would be safe.

Seeing that they had a lot of luggage, [Xiao Zishan][y001] called over a farm truck from the beach and gave them a ride to the riverside.

"This is as far as we can take you," he said with utmost sincerity one last time. "This is Hainan in the 17th century... so..." Then he only saw the backs of the seven people leaving at full speed.

***

Because the two groups had their own thoughts, each thinking the other was sent by the bandits, they were silent at first. Then, the Ming family began to slowly fall behind.

"Silly boy, why are you walking so fast?"

"I'm not tired..." Ming Lang didn't understand what was wrong with his mother. Although the road was not easy to walk, it was at least flat ground. As a young man, carrying a suitcase was not too tiring.

She pursed her lips towards the three people in front. "Slow down, we have a lot of luggage..."

Ming Lang suddenly understood. His mother meant to put some distance between them and the people in front. So the family slowed down and gradually fell behind.

Guo Yi's group didn't have much luggage, and they were all law enforcement officers, so they walked quickly at first. Seeing the family falling further and further behind, he felt a little happy. He touched the Type 64 pistol that had been returned to him. Although he couldn't quite understand the motives of this group of bandits, he had at least escaped from their clutches. His current location was unknown, but fortunately, there were traces of human activity along the way—it shouldn't be some remote and barren land. It shouldn't be long before he saw a settlement. Where there were people, there would be communication tools. Once he contacted his organization, things would be easier.

"Old Xue, what do you think is going on?" he asked Xue Ziliang, who was walking beside him, his mood much lighter. The burly man was carrying a huge backpack and walked with unusual ease among the rocks and wild grass.

"I don't know." The ABC shrugged. "Maybe they don't want to offend US law enforcement officers."

*Bullshit.* Guo Yi thought this American really had forgotten his roots after two generations, regardless of skin color or race, with such an arrogant look.

"Xue, that's a thoughtless thing to say."

"Then what else can we do? We don't even know where we are. By the way, what did he say we were in? Lin-something?"

"It's Lingao, a county in Hainan Province."

Apparently, Xue Ziliang had no geographical concept of Hainan and even asked if it was Chinese territory. Little Guo, who almost fainted, had to give him a little lesson in Chinese geography.

"But it might not be true, right?" Xue Ziliang said.

"Well, I believe if we were really in Lingao, the police station would have been here long ago with such a big commotion, and our mobile phones wouldn't have no signal."

"There you have it, Guo," Xue Ziliang said as he walked. "We don't even know the basic situation around us. What can we infer? Let's hurry up and get to a place with people."

The terrain slowly rose, though not obviously. They were now going uphill. The land had been developed, and traces of human activity were everywhere. Small paddy fields could be seen from time to time by the river, with irrigation channels dug from the river... Besides that, there was just endless desolate wilderness, with grass growing as tall as a person in some places. There were few tall trees on the road, only some miscellaneous woods and bushes. The river flowed by, looking very clear.

"Let's rest for a while." At this time, the rumbling sound of water could be heard in the distance. Xue Ziliang suggested, "Sarlina said she's not feeling well."

"Is that so? Did she catch a cold?" Guo Yi said, sitting down with a plop and taking out his Type 64 pistol from his pocket. He was anxious to check the condition of the gun. It was a bit surprising that the bandits would return his pistol. Whatever their motives, it saved him a lot of trouble—losing a gun was a big problem.

"No, she wouldn't." Xue Ziliang was about to say something when a rapid gong sound suddenly came from the grass. The three of them were startled, and then a dozen or so feathered arrows shot out from the grass and woods!
