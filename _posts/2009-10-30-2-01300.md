"The reward is no matter," Magistrate Wu said with a bitter smile. Thirty shi of rice was a small price to pay for thirty soldiers. "You have worked hard, Adjutant."

"It is for the safety of the city," Wu Ya replied, though his face was flushed with the effort of his negotiations. "Commander Li was... reluctant. And the gunpowder... we must pay double for what we use."

"He cannot be blamed," the Magistrate sighed. "The garrisons are a hollow shell. He has no men to spare."

As they spoke, the Master of Records and the Director of Studies arrived. The Master of Law was on patrol, and the County Instructor had been dispatched to summon the local gentry. In the Ming Dynasty, the power of the gentry was a force to be reckoned with. They were a complex and varied class, a web of officials, landlords, and scholars whose influence reached from the humblest village to the inner sanctum of the Imperial court.

The gentry of Lingao were few, and many lived in fortified villages, unwilling to leave their homes undefended. But those whose interests were tied to the county town came, their faces a mixture of arrogance, obsequiousness, and feigned profundity.

"Esteemed elders," Magistrate Wu began, his voice grave. "A large force of pirates is at Bopu. They show no sign of leaving. The harbor is filled with giant ships and fast boats. Tomorrow, they will surely sail up the river, and the situation will be critical. Adjutant Wu has secured thirty soldiers from the garrison, but they are not enough."

His words sent a ripple of unease through the room. Wu Ya knew this was a performance, a well-worn tactic to pry open the purses of the wealthy. The county's finances were in a state of collapse. The salaries of the militiamen were months in arrears. To defend the city would require money, and the gentry were the only source.

"I will live or die with this city," the Magistrate declared. "You are the pillars of this community. The duty of defense falls upon us all. I ask you to work with me, with one heart and one mind."

"We will follow Your Excellency's lead!" the crowd chorused.

"I wish to recruit two hundred more militiamen," the Magistrate announced.

A gentleman spoke up. "Your Excellency's loyalty is a blessing to us all. But the pirates have not yet made a move. To recruit more men now... might it not cause a panic?"

Another quickly added, "After last year's typhoon, the people are suffering. We should not burden them further."

A chorus of complaints followed, a litany of high taxes and bad harvests. Some suggested they should wait for the patrol boats of the Qiongya Brigade, that the government forces would surely deal with the pirates.

The Magistrate's face grew dark. Suddenly, a voice cut through the murmuring. "The city is in peril, and you are all still haggling over a few taels of silver!"

Instructor Feng entered, followed by two attendants carrying a man in a rattan chair. A wave of respect washed over the room. Even the Magistrate hurried forward to greet the newcomer.

It was Liu Dalin, the only *jinshi* from Lingao, a man who had passed the highest imperial examination but had been struck down by paralysis before he could take up an official post. Though his body was broken, his mind was sharp, and his voice carried the weight of authority.

"The militiamen must be recruited," he declared, his voice ringing with conviction. "Do you think this great pirate fleet has come all this way merely to occupy Bopu? They are only thirty li from here. They could be at our gates by noon. When the army is at our walls, will your family fortunes still be safe?"

He shifted in his chair, his eyes sweeping over the assembled gentry. "And you still count on the government troops? Have you not heard the reports? The pirates have iron ships that move without sails or oars. What can the Baisha naval base do against such a force?"

A new wave of fear washed over the room.

"Since ancient times," Liu Dalin continued, "local militias have often proven more effective than government soldiers. One fights for a salary, the other for his home. The plan now is to rely on ourselves." He turned to the Magistrate. "But recruiting men is only the first step."

He then laid out his plan: send word to the villages to raise their own militias and build earthen walls for defense; implement a scorched-earth policy, evacuating the smaller, indefensible villages; conduct a census and enforce the curfew to root out spies; send scouts to monitor the pirates' movements; and erect stockades outside the three city gates to bolster the defenses.

"I will donate thirty shi of grain," he concluded.

His words shamed the others into action. Pledges of grain and silver were made, and in a short time, three hundred shi of grain and a hundred taels of silver had been collected.

The town was transformed into a fortress. The male refugees were put to work repairing the walls, hauling stones and logs. The students of the county school, their hearts filled with a patriotic fire, were armed with rusty sabers and swords from the county armory and tasked with defending sections of the wall. The two "Tiger Squat" cannons on the city gates, relics of a bygone era, were prepared for battle.

The officials knew that the influx of refugees was a tinderbox, that a single spark could ignite a popular uprising. Soup kitchens were set up, and the Master of Law patrolled the streets, his men dispensing swift and brutal justice to any who dared to speak out of turn. The sound of the cane and the cries of the unlucky echoed through the cold autumn night.

In a narrow alley behind the county yamen, a faint light shone from a small residence. A man and a woman sat on the bluestone slab of a well platform, their faces grim. The man lowered a series of iron chests into the well, the sound of their descent a dull splash in the silent courtyard.

"Is it safe?" the woman whispered, her voice trembling. "The savings of a lifetime..."

"The well is deep," the man replied. "Even if the pirates take the city, it would take them more than a day to drain it. And without this grapple," he said, hiding the iron tool under a nearby tree, "not even a god could retrieve them."

He stood and clapped his hands. "Tomorrow, you will take the family to your parents' house. Chengxuan and I will remain in the city."

"And you?"

"I have my brothers to protect me. And Chengxuan is a student at the county school. He cannot leave. The Magistrate has had his eye on our family. If Chengxuan flees, he will use it as an excuse to strip him of his academic title." He smiled, a flash of cunning in his eyes. "I have just sent thirty taels of silver to the Magistrate. A small investment. If the city does not fall, the contract for the autumn grain tax collection will be mine. And if it does..." he chuckled, "in the chaos, there will be opportunities. How can I, Gou Dah√π, be an ordinary man who panics?"
