In addition to chartering boats, each branch also dispatched several scheduled passenger boat services daily. These passenger boats departed on time, regardless of whether they were full, to ensure timely arrival. Cargo boats traveled in convoys whenever possible, with each fleet consisting of 6 to 12 boats. Each convoy was assigned a manager responsible for purchasing supplies and handling negotiations at customs gates along the way. A waterway escort, accompanied by several dedicated security personnel, was responsible for the safety of the boats. Passenger boats passing through areas with poor security were also equipped with security personnel.

Because the passenger boats were dispatched on a regular schedule, each branch could also accept and deliver letters. This was not Zhang Xin's invention—private shipping in this era already offered such services. Commercial activities were frequent in Jiangnan, and with a large flow of people, there was a high demand for the circulation of both private and business correspondence. Zhao Yigong naturally wouldn't pass up this business opportunity. If conditions allowed, he also wanted to open passenger and cargo transport and postal routes from Beijing to Jiangnan, and from Jiangnan to Guangdong. Of course, such cross-headquarters business would have to be coordinated by the general administration in Guangzhou.

Mao Sansheng was busy organizing the Jiangnan headquarters' passenger and cargo transport company according to this model, especially in recruiting boat owners for the joint venture. Zhao Yigong knew this would not be easy—if they couldn't offer sufficient benefits to the boat owners, why would they join the joint venture and be "exploited" by Qiewei?

He knew that talk of "joining the joint venture to increase business volume" was empty rhetoric at this point. To attract boat owners, the first step was to find them a patron, making them feel secure. The Yansheng Duke's mansion had taken in a large number of "mansion households" from the common people during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Many fishermen around Weishan Lake voluntarily became attached to the Kong family, willing to serve them by providing fish and shrimp in exchange for the protection of the Yansheng Duke's mansion.

The "Australian" brand name carried no weight in Jiangnan, and Eunuch Yang had no influence there either. He had to find another local power to act as a protector.

For this purpose, he and Jin Lige went to visit the Catholic church in Hangzhou.

The Catholic church in Hangzhou was located near Tianshuiqiao. The property was purchased by Yang Tingyun in 1627, who then built a small chapel, along with a residence for priests and a monastery. The missionary Lazzaro Cattaneo resided there and presided over it. At this time, Cattaneo was in charge of all missionary activities in both Jiangsu and Zhejiang, making him the highest authority of the Catholic Church in the Jiangnan region.

From the outside, the Tianshuiqiao Catholic Church did not look like a church—it had been converted from a residence. If not for the cross on the roof of the chapel visible from outside the courtyard walls, passersby would not have noticed that this was a "Temple of the Cross."

This place was the headquarters of the entire Catholic Church in the Jiangnan region. Jin Lige couldn't contain his excitement and made the sign of the cross, even though he was still on the street.

Zhao Yigong instructed his personal servant, Jiying, to deliver their calling card. In a short while, the main gate opened, and two people came out to welcome them inside.

The architecture inside the courtyard was very different from the outside. A slightly Gothic-style building had been constructed there. In the center was a door with stone steps, and many windows opened on all four sides, decorated with strange and intricate patterns. Looking in through the open doors and windows, the ceiling was very high. Next to the church was another residence for the priests. After Zhao Yigong's party announced their arrival, Lazzaro Cattaneo soon appeared.

He was a tall and stately Italian man with a long, beautiful beard that had turned gray, and a prominent nose. However, his curly hair was combed straight up in the Chinese style, and he wore a square scarf like a Chinese scholar, dressed in a white cloth robe.

Cattaneo was known among the missionaries for his "long and beautiful beard and stately figure." He came from a noble family in Tuscany, Italy, and had an excellent demeanor. So much so that during the "Guo Jujing Incident" of 1606, which caused a stir in Guangdong, it was rumored among the officials and people that the Portuguese wanted to make him the emperor of China. Although he was now over seventy years old—a very advanced age for this era—he still looked healthy. He had studied Chinese in Macau and had been a missionary in Shaoguan, Nanchang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. Since his first arrival in Macau in 1594, this missionary had been in China for nearly forty years. He spoke the Nanjing dialect of Mandarin fluently. His status among the missionaries was very high; when Matteo Ricci first went to Beijing, he was the one who managed the church affairs in Nanjing and other places.

Seeing Zhao Yigong and Jin Lige arrive, he smiled and came down the steps to greet them.

When Father Trigault saw him, he was overcome with emotion. Among the first group of missionaries who had opened the way into China, Ricci, Sabbatino de Ursis, and Nicolas Trigault had all passed away. Of the original "pioneers," only Cattaneo was still alive, continuing to preside over the church's affairs.

"Padre!"

"Hello, my brother," Cattaneo greeted him with a smile.

Seeing Zhao Yigong, he hurried forward to bow and greet him: "Ah, Mr. Zhao, a pleasure to meet you. I have been waiting for you for a long time!" He was very skilled in these Chinese-style courtesies.

"Padre, this is Mr. Zhao. This is the letter I brought from Macau," Father Trigault said.

"Ah, of course, of course. I have already received the letter from the Father President," he said with a smile, and then graciously asked, "Mr. Zhao, please come to my humble abode for tea first."

News of Father Trigault's visit to Hangzhou had been sent from the Jesuit society in Guangzhou to Hangzhou several months ago. In the letter, the Jesuits had once again instructed Cattaneo to "do his best to help the Chinese man who comes with Father Trigault." As a foreigner, Cattaneo himself couldn't provide much help; the "help" referred to using the power of the Hangzhou church.

Zhao Yigong smiled and said, "I would like to see the church first."

"Of course, please, this way!"

Cattaneo led the way, and the group crossed the courtyard, walked up the steps, and entered the church.

Zhao Yigong had never been to a church in the old world; he had only seen them in books and movies. He found that this church, built in a Western style, was basically similar to his impression. The main hall was long and narrow, with a high ceiling adorned with simple religious paintings. On both sides were windows with carved decorations—very Chinese, covered with window paper, which made the church somewhat dim.

In the center was a shrine decorated with incense lamps and curtains, housing an oil painting of Jesus. Although Zhao Yigong didn't go to church, he had seen many such images and was not particularly impressed. This surprised Cattaneo a little, because all Chinese people who came here were greatly interested in the painting of Jesus, not only because it depicted a Westerner, but also because of the accuracy and realism of Western painting.

The "Australian's" indifferent attitude was not a feigned lack of interest. Cattaneo could see that oil painting was nothing new or strange to this Australian.

Besides the main altar, there were two side altars, each with a statue of a saint.

"This is Saint Peter," Cattaneo said, seeing Zhao Yigong's interest in the side altars. "He holds two keys, pointing to the gates of heaven. The other is a statue of Saint Paul. In the posture of a missionary, he holds a holy cross in one hand and points to a Latin phrase with the other—" The priest recited it in Latin and then translated: "We preach Christ crucified..."

Zhao Yigong then followed him to a Lady Chapel on the right. The layout of the Lady Chapel was similar to the main hall, but smaller, about the size of a large modern conference room. It also housed a painting, this one of a Madonna and Child.

He estimated that the main hall could accommodate about two hundred believers, and the Lady Chapel about twenty or thirty. The size of the Catholic community in Hangzhou was probably no more than a thousand people, pitifully small in scale. However, this community included a large number of officials, gentry, and scholars, and possessed considerable social influence.

After touring the church, Cattaneo invited Zhao Yigong and the others to his residence for tea.

The residence was very simple, with completely Chinese-style furniture and decorations. The bookshelves and desk were piled with thread-bound books. If not for the crucifix hanging on the wall, it would be hard to imagine this was the home of a European missionary.

He then invited Zhao Yigong and Father Trigault to sit down. A young servant, in his twenties, dressed in a blue robe and a small cap, with delicate features, brought tea. He was clearly a Chinese man, with a small cross hanging on his chest, indicating he had converted.

The tea was green tea—it seemed this priest had fully adapted to local customs. Zhao Yigong had already prepared a gift to his liking. Although the missionaries came to China with the spirit of martyrs, ready to abandon everything and spend their lives spreading the gospel in a foreign land, it did not mean they did not miss their former way of life.

Zhao Yigong's gift was a case of red wine, brewed by Xue Ziliang in his small winery on the estate. Of course, the grapes used were not special wine grapes like Cabernet or Pinot Noir, but ordinary table grapes. However, for Cattaneo, who had lived in inland China for decades and rarely saw other Europeans, it was still a very precious gift—a small comfort for his homesickness in his old age.

"Thank you, Mr. Zhao," Cattaneo said, very moved. Zhao Yigong took the opportunity to inquire about the church affairs in Hangzhou. Besides his own curiosity, Daoquanzi also wanted to know how much power the Catholic church in Hangzhou really had.

Cattaneo was not secretive about it. Although the Hangzhou church was not as important in status as the Beijing church, it was more stable than others. Although Yang Tingyun and Li Zhizao had passed away, their children, students, and old friends were still very enthusiastic about the church. The Yang family, in particular, had not only purchased the land to build the Tianshuiqiao church but also donated a piece of land at Dafangjing for the burial of missionaries. His daughter, whose baptismal name was Ines, had contributed a great deal to the church. Therefore, the Yang family had the greatest influence on the Catholic church in Hangzhou.
