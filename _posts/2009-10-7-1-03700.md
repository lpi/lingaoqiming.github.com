"Guangzhou," [Xiao Zishan][y001] murmured, his gaze fixed on the distant silhouette of the Zhenhai Tower against the vast blue sky. "I shall return." The vow was a quiet promise made to the ancient city. The tower, with its red sandstone walls and double-eaved roof, was a landmark of this era, a constant in a world of flux. He smiled. For him, it was not ancient at all; it was a modern marvel.

The new residence, a gift from a newly pliable Gao Ju, was a testament to Sun Chang's growing understanding of his masters' minds. The property sat on a rise of land, a sprawling, irregular plot bordered on two sides by water. The original house was a ruin, the garden a tangled wilderness of thorns and rubble. Yet, amidst the decay, there was potential. A placid pond, the ghost of a rockery, and a few ancient trees hinted at its former splendor. It was dilapidated and cheap, but it was also secluded, spacious, and ripe for transformation.

The plans, drafted by the colony's architects, were ambitious. They would create a fortress disguised as a traditional Lingnan residence. The exterior would blend seamlessly with its surroundings, but the interior would be a bastion of 21st-century technologyâ€”a modern nerve center for trade, intelligence, and communications, hidden within the shell of the past. Offices, dormitories, a surveillance room, a telegraph room, a warehouse, and a vault would all be concealed behind the facade of traditional courtyard architecture.

The project was a long-term investment. For now, with the wormhole's energy fading, all but the most essential work was on hold. The trans-temporal trade would cease, and the advance party would be withdrawn until the final, one-way journey. For now, masons hired by Sun Chang were simply repairing the outer walls and the main house. Watching them work, [Xiao Zishan][y001] felt a pang of reluctance. He did not know when he would see this place again.

After the final transmigration, they would no longer be harmless merchants selling novelties. They would be a new power, a force of rebellion. As a member of the Executive Committee, it was unlikely he would return to Guangzhou while it remained under enemy control. How long, he wondered, before their own flag flew from the Zhenhai Tower?

His reverie was broken by the arrival of [Wen Desi][y002], his face alight with a triumphant grin. For the past week, while [Xiao Zishan][y001] had overseen the construction, [Wen Desi][y002] and [Engineer Wang][y003] had been liquidating their remaining inventory.

"[Zishan][y001]! Still playing foreman?"

"[Director Wen][y002], you should be keeping a low profile."

"I have my escorts from the Qiwei agency, and my own talismans." He patted his bulging waist. "I've learned my lesson. I've added a gas mask to my kit." He had just returned from a visit to Gao Ju, where he had delivered Yu E'shui's carefully crafted prophecy.

"And Gao Ju's reaction?"

"Difficult to say," [Wen Desi][y002] mused. "He looked as though he'd just swallowed a dozen green olives. But when he learned we were extending him a full line of credit for our remaining stock, he was so moved he nearly wept."

They both laughed. The final shipment was worth two hundred thousand taels. It was a calculated risk. For the Committee, the cost of the goods was trivial, a mere thirty thousand RMB. But for Gao Ju, it was a lifeline, a gesture of immense trust that would bind him to them.

"He must have paid a handsome sum as well," [Xiao Zishan][y001] noted.

"Two thousand taels of gold. And we sold him things we never dared to before. It's the last run, after all. Might as well clear the shelves." [Wen Desi][y002]'s laughter subsided. "This is our final income before the crossing."

"Will it be enough?"

"We've run the numbers a dozen times. Even without this, our reserves are sufficient. We even have a two-million emergency fund."

"I just worry we've missed something critical. We're rebuilding an entire industrial system from scratch. One missing component could cripple us." [Xiao Zishan][y001] was, as always, the voice of caution.

"Let's not dwell on it. Let's get things settled here."

Back in the newly repaired house, Sun Chang waited with a ledger. He had become their de facto steward. To entrust such a large enterprise to a man they had known for less than three months was a leap of faith, but they had little choice.

"Sun Chang," [Wen Desi][y002] began, "we are returning to Australia. We will be back next year. You are to look after this residence. Cause no trouble. If you have problems, consult with Master Sun, or with Master Gao Ju. I have spoken with him; he will see you."

"Yes, master. And where shall we welcome you upon your return?"

"There is no need. We will send someone to contact you." [Wen Desi][y002] produced an aluminum medallion that had been sawn in half. He gave one piece to Sun Chang. "The person who comes will have the other half. Use this as a token. Follow their instructions."

"Yes, master. There is one more thing."

"What is it?"

"This residence is large. I cannot manage it alone. I ask the masters to purchase one or two more servants."

"That will not be necessary. Gao Qing's family will move here. His son, Gao Di, is training with your martial uncle. You will oversee his education as well. Do not let him grow to be as useless as his father. The household finances will be your responsibility. Gao Di will handle the bookkeeping. Your salary will be two taels of silver and half a shi of rice per month."

"Understood."

"And though I said to cause no trouble, do not simply lock yourself away."

"Master?" Sun Chang looked confused.

"Go out," [Wen Desi][y002] clarified. "Walk the city. Gather information. You will report to us when we return."

"Yes, master."

"Wait for us. We will be back."

***

The day after the transmigrators departed, as Gao Qing's family was packing to move to the new residence, Steward Yan appeared at their gate.

As Gao Qing moved to answer, his wife, Gao Xian, erupted.

"Go on then! Go and grovel! We came here first, yet that newcomer Sun Chang is now a free man and a steward, while you are still nothing but a handyman!"

Gao Qing stood silently, his head bowed.

"I must have had eight lifetimes of bad luck to be saddled with a useless man like you!" she shrieked, her voice thick with contempt. "What has the Gao family ever given us? And how have the Australian masters treated us? Yet you sell them out, and for what?"

"[Master Wen][y002] is a foreigner..." he mumbled.

"So what if he is? He treats us with kindness! I would follow him to the ends of the earth! Go on, sell them out! Be the Gao family's loyal dog!"

Their two children watched, their faces grim. They were old enough to understand the rift between their parents, and their hearts sided with their mother. The Australian masters were kind. They gave them delicious food and fascinating toys.

Gao Qing hung his head, defeated. Gao Xian swept past him to the gate, her face transformed into a mask of polite deference. "Steward Yan! What a coincidence. My husband has already gone to the new residence to prepare. I am just packing with the children. If you have business, perhaps he can call on you tomorrow?"

The steward knew she was lying, but he was powerless. He turned away, muttering under his breath, "These foreign devils and their witchcraft. A few days, and they have them all eating out of their hands."
