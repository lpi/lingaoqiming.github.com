The past few days had been a blur of activity for Guo Yi. The more he learned, the less he understood. What he had envisioned as a brief, two-day trip had stretched into an open-ended investigation. His superiors were growing impatient, their voices on the phone laced with a thinly veiled suspicion that he was either chasing phantoms or enjoying an extended vacation at the public's expense. But the case had taken root in his mind, a puzzle he couldn't resist.

People were arriving almost daily, a steady trickle of young men from every corner of the country, their dialects a Babel of modern China. They were not the usual migrant laborers who flocked to the factories of the Pearl River Delta. They carried large, heavy bags and a palpable sense of purpose.

His inquiries at local wholesale markets revealed another anomaly. Over the past three months, the sales of certain goods had skyrocketed: food, medicine, tools, pumps, motors, high-quality steel, copper, and other raw materials. It was clear that Transmigration Trading was sourcing simple items locally, while their nationwide network procured more specialized equipment.

He abandoned all attempts at deduction and decided to go directly to the source. A motorcycle taxi dropped him at the gate of the old militia base. The place was a relic of a bygone era, the buildings a testament to the spartan aesthetics of the 60s and 70s. The gate was open, two old men smoking and chatting in the gatehouse. He saw no sign of new construction, despite the company's extensive purchases of building materials.

Not wanting to alert them, he climbed a small hill overlooking the base and observed through his binoculars. On the training ground, teams in green uniforms moved through a series of strange, ritualistic drills. They held short bamboo poles, marching to the rhythm of a drum. They formed lines, columns, and squares. The front rank would kneel, their poles pointing skyward, while the ranks behind held theirs level. They mimed loading and firing, their movements precise and synchronized, yet their hands were empty. It was a pantomime of a battle from another age.

He scanned the rest of the base. In a sandpit, a group practiced unarmed combat, their instructor a man who carried the unmistakable aura of a professional soldier. On a pier, sparks flew as men welded a structure of iron barrels and angle steel. Two small rowboats sat on cradles, awaiting some unknown purpose.

He returned to the city that evening, his mind a tangle of unanswered questions. He sat in a small restaurant, nursing a beer, the frustration a bitter taste in his mouth. He was a man who prided himself on his intelligence, on his ability to see the patterns others missed. But this... this was a cypher he couldn't break.

*I should go back,* he thought. He had been here for four days, and he was no closer to an answer. The company was suspicious, yes, but they had broken no laws. Their massive purchases were their own affair. Let the tax bureau or the commerce department deal with it.

The whispers of Guo Yi's investigation had reached the Executive Committee, but they were dismissed as a minor annoyance. [Xiao Zishan][y001], however, was uneasy. They were on the cusp of their great enterprise; a last-minute complication was the last thing they needed. He found [Wen Desi][y002] in the cafeteria after breakfast.

"It's nothing," [Wen Desi][y002] said after a moment's thought. "Let him investigate. We have nothing to hide."

"Still, we should move quickly. Delays breed trouble."

"Are all the new arrivals confirmed?"

"All confirmed. Nineteen more will arrive by next Thursday. I've also confirmed with those who are not coming."

"Then the general assembly will be next Friday."

As they spoke, a travel-worn [Wang Luobin][y003] entered the room. For the past three months, he had been consumed by a single, intractable problem: the ship.

The wormhole's energy decayed with use. To transport hundreds of people and thousands of tons of material, a fleet of trucks was unfeasible. They needed a ship, the largest they could find. A modern cargo vessel was a self-contained world, a microcosm of the industrial society they were leaving behind. It would provide power, workshops, and a semblance of modern comfort in the harsh, primitive world that awaited them. Militarily, it would be a fortress, an iron behemoth impervious to the weapons of the 17th century. Its steel hull would be a city wall, its ram a weapon of unimaginable power.

But the dream of a magnificent battle-freighter collided with a harsh reality, a reality delivered by a young man named Meng De.

Meng De was a graduate of a maritime university, the only one among them with any practical knowledge of large ships. He had stumbled upon their recruitment posts on a BBS, and, after verifying the authenticity of their claims, had thrown in his lot with them, dreaming of a chance to reshape history.

At a special meeting convened to discuss the ship problem, he had been appointed as a consultant. He listened to their grand plans, then delivered the bad news.

"It's the crew," he said, his voice flat. "We don't have one."

"How many do we need?"

"For an older ship, under 5,000 tons, forty men. Up to 10,000 tons, over fifty. Even a new ship with an unmanned engine room needs more than twenty. These are all technical positions. We can't just fill them with our own people."

He listed the dizzying array of roles required to operate a modern cargo ship: captain, mates, radio officers, engineers, mechanics, electricians... The committee members looked at each other in dismay. A ship was a complex ecosystem, and they had only one man who understood it.

"What if it's just for the one-way trip?"

"Difficult," Meng De said. He proposed a daring plan: they would establish a freight forwarding office on the Leizhou Peninsula and charter a coastal bulk carrier, its destination set for a port in Hainan. A small group of transmigrators would pose as backpackers and hitch a ride. The rest would travel to the rendezvous point by fishing boat. At sea, they would seize the ship, force the crew off, and pilot it through the wormhole themselves.

"The Qiongzhou Strait is narrow. I can handle the ship," he said, a flicker of confidence in his eyes. "But the engine and deck crew... we'll need to train some of our own people. And the ship... it will be a one-way trip. After we run it aground, it will be little more than a pile of scrap."
