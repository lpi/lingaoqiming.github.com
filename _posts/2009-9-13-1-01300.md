"[Zishan][y001], I think you have quite the temperament of a landlord," [Wen Desi][y002] chuckled. "People talk about a protagonist's aura, but you have the 威 (wei - might/prestige) of a landlord."

"Maybe my ancestors were landlords. My dream has always been to have a large manor, grow vegetables, raise chickens, put up a grape trellis, place a wicker chair underneath, and slowly sip tea from a teapot..."

"What a life. But can't you do that now?" [Wen Desi][y002] said slowly. "We've made a lot of money. Your little dream is a piece of cake."

"It's a pity the wormhole will disappear one day." [Xiao Zishan][y001] stretched his limbs. "I felt a very obvious energy fluctuation this time."

"If only it were Doraemon's Anywhere Door," [Chief Wen][y002] laughed.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] laughed: "I haven't finished my sentence. And have a few cool and beautiful women fanning me and peeling lychees on the side. A mature woman, an older-sister type, and a little loli..." He thought for a moment, "Actually, that loli Gao Lujie is good material."

"That girl," [Wen Desi][y002] peeled a lychee while lying on the sofa, "is not Gao Qing's daughter at all."

"Hmm, the DNA difference is quite large." [Xiao Zishan][y001] began to register the pile of bowls and porcelain. Every time they came back from a crossing, he was responsible for registering the trade goods and the income. [Engineer Wang][y003] had gone back to his small machinery factory. Recently, his enthusiasm for work was so high that it surprised both [Chief Wen][y002] and [Xiao Zishan][y001]—not only did he work overtime all day, but he was also full of excitement when he came back.

"In terms of appearance, she has absolutely no genetic traits of her father, and only a slight resemblance to her brother. And then there's her height."

"[Chief Wen][y002], have you taken a fancy to this long-legged little loli?"

"Even if I have, I have to put it aside for now. There are too many important things to do. Let's first see what needs to be done."

"Of course, it's recruiting troops and buying horses."

After completing the third transmigration trade, they had more than twenty million in cash, and the conditions for material preparation had been met.

To recruit troops and buy horses, the first task was to choose a suitable assembly point—a dedicated place was needed to receive those who would report for duty in the future. Guangzhou was obviously not a suitable place. According to [Wen Desi][y002]'s idea, this location should be relatively remote, close to the future transmigration point, have sufficient living facilities to accommodate several hundred people for food and lodging, and also have a large open-air field, preferably a sports ground.

"What do we need a sports ground for?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] was baffled.

"To exercise, of course," [Wen Desi][y002] looked at his own arms and [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s belly. "If nothing else, when we need to run for our lives, we should at least be able to outrun the natives of the Ming Dynasty."

So they divided the tasks into three. [Xiao Zishan][y001], having been a salesman, was relatively familiar with the large and small cities along the coast of Guangdong, so the task of finding a base fell to him. [Wang Luobin][y003] continued to work at his machinery factory. [Wen Desi][y002] remained in Guangzhou to prepare for the next trade, while also presiding over the online discussions on the forum and scouting for professionals. The first invitation list had already been drawn up.

The fourth person to join the committee did not come from the internet, which was somewhat unexpected.

That evening, [Wen Desi][y002] had just finished reading the discussion board and was considering who to talk to individually next, when he suddenly saw [Wang Luobin][y003] walk in, wearing an oil-stained work uniform. He sat down on the sofa without a care, his face full of excitement.

"[Engineer Wang][y003], you go to work every day with such a radiant face. What good thing has happened?" [Wen Desi][y002] was very curious.

"[Chief Wen][y002], I want you to meet someone."

"Who?" [Wen Desi][y002] was secretly surprised. [Engineer Wang][y003] was usually not talkative and didn't socialize much. Moreover, he was not a local. Why did he suddenly want to introduce someone to him?

"My boss." Seeing that [Wen Desi][y002] didn't quite react, he added, "The boss of the place where I work, his surname is Zhan."

"Hmm?"

"I told him about the transmigration—"

"What?!" [Wen Desi][y002] almost jumped up.

"Old Wen, don't get excited, don't get excited," [Wang Luobin][y003] said. "His surname is Zhan, his name is [Zhan Wuya][y004]. He's a technician, very skilled, proficient in lathing, clamping, planing, and milling..."

"Alright, alright, get to the point. He didn't think you were a mental patient or a scammer?"

"Not at all. He wants to join."

"Join?" [Wen Desi][y002]'s mind couldn't process it for a moment, and he asked again, "He wants to go too?"

"Yes. The other day, when he and I were making a hand-cranked Gatling gun together..."

"What?!" This time [Wen Desi][y002] really jumped up. "[Engineer Wang][y003]!!"

He quickly lowered his voice—although the soundproofing in this room was very good.

"Are you crazy! Building illegal firearms will land you in jail!"

"It's nothing. We'll have to build guns in the Ming Dynasty anyway. Just practicing our skills." [Wang Luobin][y003] had a nonchalant look on his face. "What's it for us machinery guys to build a couple of guns? Some people have even built the Japanese Type 92 infantry gun."

"Let's not talk about the Japanese Type 92 for now. What's the deal with this boss of yours?"

"He particularly admires your line of thinking. He said to leave the machining part to him. He's preparing to move his entire factory over."

[Zhan Wuya][y004] was not the greasy old worker [Chief Wen][y002] had imagined, but a man in his early thirties, wearing a T-shirt, with his hair neatly combed. Only his large, rough hands revealed the nature of his profession.

Due to the nature of his work, [Chief Wen][y002] had a lot of contact with small subcontracting machine shops like this. Once they started talking, the two of them quickly delved into a deep discussion on some machining technology issues. Their common language brought them closer, and soon they were talking about everything.

"[Chief Wen][y002], let me put it this way. For us in the machinery business, there's nothing we can't build." [Zhan Wuya][y004]'s words were filled with the pride of the working class. "Take my little factory, for example. I wouldn't dare say I can build a tank, but building some mortars and machine guns is a piece of cake. When I was in technical school..."

He then talked for five minutes about how he had built a mortar as his graduation project. Then he and [Wang Luobin][y003] discussed the issue of gun manufacturing—it was later learned that the main reason [Wang Luobin][y003] had established such a solid friendship with Boss Zhan so quickly was that both were avid firearms enthusiasts. [Wen Desi][y002] quickly stopped their grandiloquent talk, lest someone overhear and think this was a budding illegal firearms gang.

He introduced the main equipment in his factory: 2 shearing machines, 1 80T bending machine, 1 63T punch press, 1 5T punch press, 2 lathes, 1 planer, 1 radial drilling machine, 3 bench drills, 1 cutting machine, 5 electric welding machines, 1 spot welding machine, 1 sawing machine, 1 overhead crane, 1 grinding machine, 2 grinding wheels, 1 set of oxygen welding equipment, 1 air compressor, and 1 set of baking paint room facilities.

"Actually, if we really have to rough it, the three great machines are all we need," [Zhan Wuya][y004] said. "When I was studying, I liked to read some military industry memoirs. The people in the military industry back then were real experts. With just a lathe and a vise, they could still build guns, cannons, and machine tools." He thought for a moment, "But materials are very crucial. Without good materials, the things you make will be compromised, and some can't even be processed. It's especially important to have suitable steel."

[Wang Luobin][y003] said, "We are going to establish a metallurgical industry, smelting iron and steel."

"I don't know anything about that. If the material problem can be solved, besides being able to manufacture various professional equipment, the biggest advantage of machine tools is that they can self-replicate. The production scale can be continuously expanded, and we don't have to worry about wear and tear. It can be considered sustainable development."

"Indeed, no matter how many reserves we bring, they will be consumed one day."

"Right. But there are still some things we need to bring enough of, like lathe tools, which are generally made of alloy steel or sintered ceramic. We won't be able to make them at the beginning. And grinding wheels for polishing, they require special materials, and the sintering also has its technology. Also, I don't know if substitutes can be used for lubricants, and there are many types..."

"We can solve these problems one by one," [Wen Desi][y002] said, invigorated. "Old Zhan, you can be in charge of the preparations for the industrial side for now."

"No problem!" [Zhan Wuya][y004]'s mood had never been so full of passion. Since leaving the factory to start his own business, he had been struggling for nearly ten years. Although he had achieved a small success, his life had become boring and dull. Every day he was tired of dealing with customers. At this moment, an unprecedented new world appeared before his eyes. His fighting spirit was high, and he decided to make a big splash in this new world.

The Industrial Group of the Transmigration Committee was established on this day. As a customary term, it was called the Industrial Front. A few days later, another member of the Industrial Front also reported for duty. This was [Ma Qianzhu][y005], who would later fiercely compete with [Zhan Wuya][y004] for the title of the father of transmigration industry in his memoirs.

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] originally frequented the same forum as [Xiao Zishan][y001] and the others, and they were somewhat familiar with each other. However, at the beginning, he did not participate in this wormhole transmigration discussion, but was engrossed in his own fantasy design of a fully mechanical computing center system—named Gear V—in another thread. At first, he thought that [Chief Wen][y002]'s wormhole was purely fictional, just like his mechanical computer. Later, when he discovered that this group of people was really preparing to go to the Ming Dynasty, he quickly had a friend sign him up. As for his motivation, it was not at all strange: only by creating a pure world without microchips, where he himself became a powerful figure, could he realize his ideal: a luxurious mechanical computing center covering an area of six thousand mu, with a power of eighty thousand horsepower, and capable of twenty thousand operations per second—this huge machine made his heart tremble with excitement just thinking about it.

In general, [Ma Qianzhu][y005]'s hobbies were basically of the steampunk category. Keywords: multi-turreted, riveted, steam-powered, and rigid. A forest of smokestacks, roaring boilers: the black smoke from burning coal, the thick steam erupting from the boilers, the huge roar of colliding steel, giant steam turbine trains running on the ground, and multi-turreted, rigid-hulled, helium-filled flying gunboats with countless compartments in the air... this was his ideal world.

After receiving the phone invitation from [Wen Desi][y002], he packed his bags without hesitation, quit his job of drawing frighteningly dense highway design drawings, and embarked on the train to Guangdong.

He was not going to Guangzhou, but to a county-level city he had never heard of. After getting off the train, he still had to transfer to a long-distance bus. This place was the departure base that [Xiao Zishan][y001] had found. Here, the transmigrators would prepare their horses and sharpen their weapons, get ready, and embark on a one-way road to conquer a parallel world.
