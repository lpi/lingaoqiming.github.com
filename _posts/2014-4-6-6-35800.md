The rest of the day was a symphony of astonishment from the assembled heroes. In Guangzhou, to avoid detection, they had eschewed inns owned by the Qihui Group. This was their first taste of an Australian-style inn, and it was a revelation.

The bathroom was so immaculate they hesitated to step inside. Their own new, fragrant wooden bathtubs were crude in comparison to the large, sparkling white tub with its delicate patterns. It was one thing to tremble as you climbed a stool to enter, another to elegantly lift a leg and step in. And while a new tub was fine, after a few uses, dirt would accumulate in the cracks, turning black and moldy, resistant to even the most vigorous scrubbing and sunning.

A twist of the bronze faucet produced a continuous stream of hot water, a godsend for the lower-ranking disciples of the Hengshan Sect. Otherwise, filling the tub would have been a monumental task: one group tending the fire, another hauling water, carefully pouring it into the tub.

A more advanced setup might have a stove underneath, "boiling a person alive," which only slightly reduced the labor.

When it was time to bathe, the superiors went first. Changing the water was out of the question. Even just using cold water, there wasn't enough time. In a large sect, bathing was a communal affair, done in shifts. Elders first, then juniors. The low-ranking disciples, unless they were "favorites," could only use the water left by their masters and seniors. The water that was finally discarded was rich enough to be used as fertilizer.

Now, everyone could indulge in a long, luxurious bath. For people who had been on the road for days, this was a profound pleasure.

After bathing, they returned to their rooms and donned the inn's bathrobes. A cool breeze wafted in, a refreshing balm. When traveling, most had to squeeze into a single room or sleep on a smelly communal bunk. Now, they all had double rooms, comfortable and free of fleas and bedbugs. The sheets and quilts were so clean they hesitated to sit on them. Their own bedding, carried all this way, looked rather shabby in comparison. When they read in the "User Manual" that the bedding was changed for each guest, even these seasoned martial artists were astounded. On the road, one made do, but even in their own sects, with ample water and fire, bedding was washed only every few months, aired out on sunny days at most.

They had heard of the "extravagance" of the 髡. They had imagined gold spittoons and pots washed with sugar water. They hadn't expected an "extravagance" that so dramatically improved their quality of life. Zhuo Yifan and the others were worldly men. They knew a continuous supply of hot water was a luxury beyond the ordinary.

Though the major sects had great reputations and connections with high officials, life in the picturesque mountains was not entirely idyllic. As the saying goes, "Water is carried, vegetables are grown, meat is hunted, and fire is from firewood."

Though most sects kept servants and had a few tenant farmers, a large amount of heavy labor still fell to the disciples. Even a beloved disciple like Zhuo Yifan had to do some copying work. In terms of comfort, except for a few particularly wealthy sects, even the sect leader's standard of living was only that of an upper-middle-class family. The disciples fared even worse—unless they came from wealthy families.

In the evening, Li Xiaoliu delivered dinner with a four-wheeled cart, laden with tin lunch boxes, two for each person, containing rice and dishes, and two large pots of soup. The "old mistress" and the "young master" each received a banquet, an exquisite affair. Zhuo Yifan, of course, did not eat alone. He invited Wan Lifeng, Sha Guangtian, and Meng Bofei to join him. At the table, they discussed their next steps and their first impressions of Lingao.

The wine was a local rum. Wan Lifeng had wanted a bottle of the world-famous "Guoshi Wushuang," but was told it was out of stock. Fortunately, the rum was strong, with a strange aroma that was a new experience.

Given their important mission, they drank sparingly, then began to discuss their plans in low voices.

Though Zhuo Yifan was the leader, he did not know the specific details of their mission. Before they left, the White Stone Daoist had only told him to contact Sima Qiudao, who would relay their instructions.

However, they all knew they had come to Lingao to assassinate or kidnap an important 髡 leader. If the mission was to steal secrets, only a few master thieves would have been sent.

"Brother Zhuo, it's obvious what we're here to do," Wan Lifeng said slowly. "It's nothing more than killing and arson. I'm just a little worried that once we make our move, this is the 髡's lair. It won't be easy for us to escape."

One had to have an escape plan. A single mistake could cost you your life. Once you were dead, you were nothing.

But Zhuo Yifan was confident. "Don't worry, Uncle Wan. For this operation, Seventh Master has already arranged an escape plan."

Since they had arrived, and everyone present was a core member, it was time to discuss some matters. An unsettled mind could easily lead to trouble.

Once they made their move, regardless of the outcome, the 髡 would launch a city-wide search. Lingao was the 髡's stronghold. Whether they fled to the sea or to the neighboring counties, they would face a massive encirclement.

Fleeing to the sea was clearly impossible. The Qiongzhou Strait was now the 髡's inner lake, and the road from East Gate Market to Bopu was heavily guarded. To break through the encirclement and seize a boat was a fantasy.

Even if they managed to cross the sea, the 髡's influence in Leizhou was also strong. It would be walking into a trap.

The only possibility was to flee to a neighboring county and then find a way to cross the sea. Though the 髡 now occupied all of Hainan, their presence was limited outside of Lingao. There were many wilderness areas, and the possibility of escape was high.

The problem was that the 髡 would anticipate this and would deploy a large number of troops at the checkpoints on the roads to the neighboring counties.

"...Our plan is to do the opposite," Zhuo Yifan said, dipping his chopsticks in wine and drawing on the table. "Not north, not east, not west, but south!"

"South?" Sha Guangtian was surprised. He had studied the map of Lingao. "That's the Li people's territory!"

The central part of Hainan Island had always been the Li area, a mysterious and unpredictable place even for the Han people on the island. Most stayed away from its dense forests and miasma.

"Exactly!" Zhuo Yifan nodded. "The 髡 will think we won't go south. Even if the southern roads are guarded, the defense won't be strong. That's our only chance."

"But we know nothing about the Li area!" Meng Bofei interjected. "We don't have a guide. Not to mention the savages, the miasma will kill us."

"Shi Weng has already made arrangements," Zhuo Yifan said, revealing this as instructed. "He has arranged for a righteous man who is familiar with the terrain to be our guide. He will lead us from the Li area to the neighboring county, and then we will cross the sea back to the mainland."

"I see!" Meng Bofei nodded. "I'm relieved to hear that."

Wan Lifeng still seemed worried. "Brother Zhuo, are these local contacts reliable? We've been risking our lives since we entered Lingao. If there's a single mistake, we'll be doomed."

Zhuo Yifan knew Wan Lifeng needed a clear answer. "Before the operation, our guide will meet with us."

"Tomorrow, the 髡's police will come to register our households. Do we need to make any preparations?" Wan Lifeng asked. "How much should we prepare for bribes?"

"None at all," Zhuo Yifan said. "Seventh Master said that the 髡 here do everything by the book. If you try to bribe them, it will only make things worse. Do as she says, and don't argue. Hide all the weapons and equipment well. Though the 髡 won't search us, we should still be prepared."

"I understand."

"Household registration is just the first step," Zhuo Yifan said patiently. "Next, we have to look at houses—and the silver sent from Delong, we have to exchange it for the 髡's banknotes. Though these are useless things, if we don't do them, the 髡 will become suspicious. Uncle Wan, you must do this seriously."

Wan Lifeng nodded and then smiled. "The houses are one thing, but this exchange, I feel sorry for the silver. Thousands of taels of silver turned into a pile of paper. We won't be able to use it when we get back to the Great Ming..."

Zhuo Yifan also smiled. "What's to be sorry about? This is a big deal. Shi Weng has already spent so much silver. A few thousand more taels is nothing."

Wan Lifeng shook his head. "I really don't understand who this Shi Weng is, to go to such great lengths to deal with the 髡. The 髡 are notoriously difficult to deal with..."
