Even Zhou Zhongjun expressed an interest in taking the acupuncturist exam. The atmosphere relaxed; the group felt that they could finally settle down in Lingao.

"We can finally get a foothold in this Nanbao," Huang Zhen sighed, taking off his hat, dusting it off, and placing it on the table. "I've been all over the country for decades, but I never expected this 髡's territory to be so difficult to navigate. It's the toughest place I've ever been!"

The others, unaware of his "adventure" that day, thought he was discouraged from days of running around. Song Shengying offered some comforting words like "a true man can bend and stretch."

Worried that Zhou Zhongjun's frequent outings and lavish spending would cause trouble, Huang Zhen once again warned everyone not to go out unless necessary, and to inform him beforehand if they had to. He shot a few glares at Zhou Zhongjun, who, feeling guilty for her minor blunder, could only listen meekly.

After settling this matter, Huang Zhen realized that the construction funds were running low. The renovation was an "all-inclusive" deal, with payments made weekly. After paying this week's installment, Huang Zhen found that the one thousand circulation coupons were almost gone. New funds had not yet arrived. This plunged the team into a new crisis.

Money makes the world go round, and that's true everywhere. Huang Zhen had seven or eight people to support and a half-finished project. Sima Qiudao had vanished like a crane into the mist, without a single word. Sima Qiudao was his contact with "Seventh Master." Without Seventh Master's covert support, he felt completely lost.

After several days of anxious waiting, Sima Qiudao finally reappeared. It turned out he had been "looking for a job" and was now working for the Native Products Company under the Ministry of Commerce. Specifically, he was a "purchasing agent," responsible for acquiring local specialties. This allowed him to travel frequently and openly within Lingao County.

Since Sima Qiudao refused to shave his head and undergo "purification," he could only be considered a "temporary worker." Now that he had found a job, he returned to Nanbao.

Sima Qiudao brought the operational funds from Seventh Master and new information: Zhuo Yifan and his group had landed in Qiongshan County and were on their way to Lingao.

Only Zhuo Yifan knew their specific mission in Lingao. However, from the initial instruction to establish a hidden presence, it was clear that the operation would be difficult and require a long time to wait for the right opportunity.

But this new group had over twenty people, which immediately presented a problem for Huang Zhen. He groaned inwardly. He already felt that seven or eight people were a bit much for his small shop. Now, another twenty-plus people were coming. How could he accommodate them? Finding housing alone would be a challenge. Nanbao was better, but finding a place in East Gate Market or Bopu would be expensive, and that's if they could even find a place to rent. The housing shortage in Lingao was severe.

Housing aside, the bigger problem was how to establish their identities. Lingao's household registration was extremely strict. How could a group of men and women, old and young, register themselves?

But Sima Qiudao said, "Don't worry, Seventh Master said they have their own way. We don't need to interfere."

"The 髡's have a tight net here..."

"It's fine," Sima Qiudao said with confidence. "Seventh Master has a plan for them. Since there are so many of them, it's better to enter openly. It won't be a problem."

"Really?" Huang Zhen was confused. But since his superiors had made the decision, it wasn't his place to question it.

On South Fifth Street in East Gate Market, a road in a suburban area full of wastelands and construction sites, a large procession of carts and horses arrived one day.

The procession was quite large. Leading the way was a two-wheeled Dongfeng carriage, followed by four four-wheeled Hongqi carriages. Then came three four-wheeled cargo carts, piled high and covered with tarps. At the rear was another two-wheeled carriage.

A procession of this size would have attracted a crowd of onlookers a year or two ago. But in the last six months, such processions had become a common sight. Their destination was usually the suburban area beyond Fifth Street in East Gate Market.

In late spring in Lingao, the weather was already getting hot. The newly planted trees along the new roads were still young and offered no shade. However, the various flowering trees were in full bloom, creating a picturesque scene of colorful clusters.

The wheels of the procession crunched over the cinder road and stopped in front of a large compound on South Fifth Street.

In a city of modern buildings, this traditionally styled structure stood out. Its new roof tiles and whitewashed walls indicated that it had been built recently.

A large, black sign with gold characters hung above the entrance: "Qiong'an Inn." This was the largest traditional-style inn in Lingao.

In recent years, the Central Plains had been in chaos. Not only were bandits rampant, but popular uprisings were a daily occurrence, and the roads were unsafe. The wealthy and powerful in the countryside built forts and organized militias for self-protection. Small and medium-sized landlords who didn't seek refuge with powerful families could barely survive in the countryside.

Even moving into the county towns was becoming increasingly unsafe. As a result, many families sold their property and moved to the peaceful and prosperous "paradises" of the Jiangnan region to "escape the turmoil."

Lingao County in distant Guangdong's Qiongzhou Prefecture had now also become a candidate for the wealthy to "escape the turmoil." Rumors of Lingao's prosperity, peace, and the happy lives of its people had spread to the mainland. The wealthy, having more opportunities to come into contact with "Australian goods," knew more about Lingao.

Although not many wealthy people knew about and had the courage to move to Lingao, for a remote place like this, the number was still considerable.

The Civil Affairs Department did not object to their immigration to Lingao—immigrants were always welcome. Moreover, these wealthy people held large amounts of capital. Their settling in Lingao would effectively stimulate consumption. Besides, the Senate also needed more gold and silver hard currency to balance its "international payments."

The "Qiong'an Inn" was born out of this situation. The owner was a member of the Lingao Advisory Council and former "manure magnate," Li Sunqian. After voluntarily handing over his ownership of the manure collection rights in Lingao County, Li Sunqian began to invest in industry under the guidance of the Ministry of Commerce.

At first, the Li family only invested in some of the Senate's state-owned enterprises. Gradually, they saw the potential of real estate and began to develop property in the East Gate Market area.

As wealthy families from the mainland flocked to Lingao, Li Sunqian seized the opportunity. He bought a large amount of land along South Fifth Street and hired the Lingao General Construction Company to design and build "luxury residences" specifically for them.

Although called "luxury residences," they were not traditional buildings in practice. They only maintained a traditional architectural style, while their internal structure was built according to modern architectural concepts. They were far superior to traditional buildings in terms of comfort and land utilization.

However, Li Sunqian was a native magnate, and he understood the housing preferences, family structures, and living habits of his own kind far better than the Senators. Therefore, his "luxury residences" were very popular with these wealthy families. The first batch sold out shortly after completion. While the second batch was still under construction, Li's grandson, Li Xiaopeng, had already learned the art of "selling off-plan," selling the "luxury residences" that were still under construction to the wealthy families from across the sea.

The money was collected, but the houses were still being built. The families, with their large households and countless pieces of luggage, needed a place to stay. Li Xiaopeng had a flash of inspiration and came up with the idea of building "transitional housing": an "inn" specifically for his clients.

Having received many guests, he knew that these wealthy families, having just crossed the sea, were often apprehensive. To put them at ease, he had to provide a living environment similar to their old homes.

Thus, the Li family invested in the construction of the "Qiong'an Inn." In essence, it was a Ming-style building with Australian facilities. While maintaining the atmosphere, it allowed guests to fully experience the comfort of the "Australian-style" way of life.

The inn was an instant success. For the wealthy families from across the sea, the "Australian-style" way of life had not yet influenced them. Even the "state guesthouse" in East Gate Market, the "Shangguan," they found to be too small, without even a courtyard, and with no distinction between main and side rooms—and no quarters for their servants.

The Qiong'an Inn had taken all of this into consideration during its construction. The accommodation was comfortable, and the service was attentive. So, despite the high cost of a night's stay, most of the "investment immigrants" chose to stay here.

The procession stopped in the square in front of the screen wall. The inn's assistants, who had been waiting at the entrance, rushed forward to help people down and unload luggage, bustling with activity.

The ground was swept clean, and several handcarts were already waiting to transport the luggage.

From the last two-wheeled carriage, a traveler jumped down lightly. He was dressed in a fine silk robe, with a gauze net cap, holding a beautifully colored bronze sword in one hand, and patting the dust off his clothes with the other. He looked up at the sky and said to himself, "The weather here is so hot! A good rain would be nice!"

An inn assistant smiled and was about to take the sword, but a pageboy who had gotten out of the carriage first had already taken it. The pageboy was young, with red lips and white teeth, a handsome boy of the type favored by wealthy families.

The assistants were all experienced and tactful. Seeing that they had failed to curry favor, they knew the sword was valuable. One of them quickly smiled and said, "It's summer all year round here in Lingao. Even the winter isn't that cold. It just doesn't rain much in the spring. In the summer, it rains nonstop, and that's when it's really unbearable. Sir, please, come inside." As he spoke, he secretly sized up the guest.

The young scholar was about twenty years old, in the prime of his life, full of energy and vitality. Although dressed as a scholar, his skin was bronze-colored. His long eyebrows reached his temples, and his eyes were like bright stars. His tightly closed lips suggested he was not one to talk idly. His slightly prominent chin gave him an air of strong character. His features were delicate but not without masculine resolve.
