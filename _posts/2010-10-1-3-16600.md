"We've finally made it through one hurdle after another," Wu Nanhai sighed, looking out at the rolling waves of rice paddies, a bountiful harvest clearly in sight. In the distance, the construction of the high-yield fields at Meitaiyang Plain was proceeding with great vigor, and the sight filled him with joy.

Although the first early-season rice planting had been a bumpy road and the harvest wasn't as good as expected, it had at least provided them with sufficient experience. Practical solutions had been found for many of the problems they encountered. He estimated that, given the current pace of construction, the 1,500 mu of new high-yield fields wouldn't be ready for sowing until at least August, which should be just in time for the late-season crop.

Of course, achieving a modern-day yield of two thousand jin per mu was impossible. He estimated the experimental fields could reach about 800 jin per mu. In Lincheng County, this was a miracle.

As for the rain-fed fields, their performance was lackluster, generally yielding only 300 to 400 jin per mu. Wu Nanhai also discovered that without adequate agricultural supplies and field management, the performance of hybrid rice was not significantly better than ordinary lodging-resistant improved varieties. The yield of hybrid rice in the rain-fed fields was only 50 to 100 jin more per mu than other varieties—not a large gap.

Nevertheless, this event, coupled with the bumper sweet potato harvest in April, had caused a sensation throughout Lincheng County. Landlords were all trying to find out what kind of seeds the Australians were using. The farm workers from the collective farm suddenly became hot commodities. As soon as they were recognized on the road, someone would pull them aside for a drink to fish for information. A few wealthy farmers and small landlords even offered to marry their daughters to them if they were willing to switch employers. It was also common for people to try to befriend farm personnel through various means, hoping to get their hands on some seeds during the harvest.

Wu Nanhai wasn't concerned. There was no point in saving seeds from hybrid rice, and the sweet potatoes would become toxic if not handled correctly. Without the support of the Agriculture Committee's technical system, such miracles wouldn't happen again. Still, for the sake of appearances, he held several large meetings to announce a strict ban on the outflow of seedlings, declaring that anyone caught would be "sent to the labor reform team."

The "labor reform team" had now become a place that made the local laborers' blood run cold. The reputation of its captain, Fu Youdi, was almost on par with Himmler's. To strengthen the laborers' awareness of the law, Wu De would periodically organize tours of the labor reform team for the natives, allowing them to fully appreciate how fortunate they were to be working honestly for the transmigrator group.

Some people who felt they had a connection with the transmigrator group, like Zhang Youfu, who had acted as a go-between for the county government and the transmigrators during the peace talks last year, would occasionally visit Wu De, hinting at their desire for some new seeds. As for Fu Bu'er, the former captive who later became the representative of Meiyang Village, he heard the "Kun bandits" had pulled off another new trick, harvesting as much as seven or eight hundred jin of rice in a single season. He couldn't sit still any longer. He rushed to Dongmen Market to find Ma Peng, hoping Ma could act as a bridge and connect him with some important figure at the farm. "A little silver won't be a problem," he said.

Ma Peng, however, told him not to worry. "The Chiefs are setting up a 'Heaven and Earth Society' recently, specifically to help everyone with farming. If you want to learn their farming methods, you just need to go to the 'Heaven and Earth Society' office in Dongmen Market and register."

"Tian Di Hui?" Fu Bu'er was puzzled. "As in, 'adding a younger brother'?"

"No, 'Heaven and Earth Society'," Ma Peng corrected. "The 'heaven' from the sky and the 'earth' from the ground."

Fu Bu'er hurried to Dongmen Market. Near the outer edge of Dongmen Street, a new two-story building had been erected. In front of it stood an out-of-place wooden memorial archway, on which were written the three large characters "Heaven and Earth Society." Flanking it was a couplet: "The earthquake shakes the high ridge, a stream of water flows beautifully for a thousand ages; The gate faces the great sea, the water of the Triad River flows for ten thousand years."

Fu Bu'er mustered his courage and walked in. The receptionist listened to his request and handed him a form to fill out. Although Fu Bu'er knew a few characters, he was semi-literate and had to ask the person inside to write for him. The registration details were nothing more than name, address, family size, and so on. Then he was asked how many mu of land he had, and how much was irrigated versus dry.

Fu Bu'er was about to answer but swallowed his words. He thought for a moment and said his family only had fifty mu of irrigated land—in reality, his family owned over four hundred mu, including three hundred mu of irrigated fields and over a hundred mu of dry fields. He said this because a thought suddenly struck him: who knew what the Kun people's intentions were in setting up this so-called "Heaven and Earth Society"? The wisdom accumulated over a thousand years of peasants being deceived by governments and nobles made Fu Bu'er immediately hedge his bets.

After registration, the clerk gave him a bamboo token with a number carved on it. He was told to come to the Heaven and Earth Society office on the first day of the next month with the token for a general meeting, which would be presided over by the society's president, Ye Yuming.

Fu Bu'er was confused. "Aren't I here to buy seeds?"

The clerk smiled. "It's not that simple. First, there's a meeting where President Ye will explain the specifics to you."

Fu Bu'er suddenly grew nervous. "Um, may I ask... does the Heaven and Earth Society require a fee?"

"A fee?" The clerk glanced at his registration form. "You only have fifty mu of irrigated land, which makes you a middle peasant. You probably won't have to pay. Only the large households with a lot of land need to pay. It's called a 'technical service fee'." The clerk looked at the papers in his hand. "It's charged per mu."

What a relief! Fu Bu'er secretly congratulated himself. As expected, there was no such thing as a free lunch in this world; there was a fee! Luckily, he had only reported fifty mu of land. Otherwise, wouldn't he have had to pay another tax for no reason? The officials in this world were all the same! However, it seemed the Kun people were quite considerate towards small households. He would most likely get a share of the seeds for free.

Fu Bu'er walked out of the Heaven and Earth Society's office, feeling quite pleased with himself. He calculated that once he got his hands on the seeds for fifty mu, he wouldn't give a single grain to his tenants. He would personally lead his long-term laborers to plant them. In the future, he would select the best for seed saving, and by next year, he could plant them in all his irrigated fields.

"The president of the Heaven and Earth Society is no longer Chen Bachi," Ye Yuming thought smugly. Calling himself Ye Bachi didn't sound very good...

He was currently standing in a meeting room on the second floor of the Heaven and Earth Society. The freshly whitewashed walls were still a bit damp, and the black paint on the wooden board at the head of the room, serving as a blackboard, had not yet dried. This place was intended for future promotional meetings with the society's clients. As for training, that would be conducted at the farm—learning by doing.

The meeting room was already filled with personnel from the Agriculture Committee, the Civil Affairs Committee, and other relevant departments, ready for the first "Agricultural Work Conference" to discuss the specific implementation methods for the Heaven and Earth Society.

Everyone agreed that using the Heaven and Earth Society as an external organization to promote agricultural technology was a good idea. Many farmers and landlords in the county were already showing demand for new agricultural methods.

Originally, Ye Yuming's plan for the society was just to provide small loans for poultry and engage in contract farming. At the same time, they would offer simple agricultural technical training to local farmers. After several days of discussion, the scope of this plan had been greatly expanded.

The new version of the Heaven and Earth Society would be divided into two departments: the Heaven Department for technology and the Earth Department for promotion.

The improved seeds and agricultural technologies would be promoted to two distinct client groups based on their status:

First were the landlords, defined as those who owned and directly managed over one hundred mu of land, either cultivating it themselves or hiring long-term and short-term laborers. These were generally called "managerial landlords."

The promotion of agricultural planting technology was primarily aimed at this group. The model was for the Heaven and Earth Society to supply seeds and train field management personnel. In the first year, the Agriculture Department would send personnel from the Heaven Department to help the landlords who purchased the seeds with their field management, while also training their own staff. Of course, all technology provided to these grain-producing households required a patent fee, which was bundled with the seeds as a service package. The fee was intended to cultivate the concept of intellectual property rights from an early stage.

Thereafter, these clients would have to pay an annual membership fee. In return, the Heaven and Earth Society would continue to provide improved seeds and basic services, such as pest and disease control for farmland, technical guidance, and the supply of pesticides and fertilizers.

"Hold on!" Ye Yuming suddenly asked. "Fertilizer is one thing—lignite and all that, plus the synthetic ammonia industry. But where do we get pesticides? Doesn't that require an organic chemistry industry?"

"Local pesticides," Wu Nanhai said. He had already accumulated considerable experience in using indigenous pesticides during the early-season planting and was quite confident. "The good results from this early rice harvest were largely thanks to local pesticides. They are certainly not as effective as modern pesticides, but they work."

"Bordeaux mixture? Copper sulfate plus limewater? How effective is it? I remember it being used on fruit trees. Can it be used on rice?" Ye Yuming recalled his high school biology lessons.

"Bordeaux mixture is a protectant. It works well if sprayed before the disease appears, and the effect lasts for two weeks. It's very effective against downy mildew but not so much against rust. As for early inorganic pesticides, there's also lime-sulfur mixture. That one is quite effective as a fungicide, especially against rust and powdery mildew. It has a lasting effect and can also prevent some insects," Wu Nanhai, now well-versed in information dug up from old books, explained. "For rice pests, there's a local formula called 'Huangkou Tu 666' that can control them. It's basically Chinese medicinal herbs mixed with simple inorganic compounds and is effective against rice aphids. There should be many more formulas like this."

He continued enthusiastically, "I plan to propose to the Executive Committee that the Agriculture Committee should set up a pesticide factory and a local fertilizer factory. These two things alone would be superweapons for agriculture in the Ming Dynasty. Besides our own use, we can also sell them on the market. People will be lining up to buy them!"

Wan Lihui said, "The profit margin on external sales won't be high. They're too bulky and heavy, and the profit per unit of weight is too low."

"No problem," Wu Nanhai explained. "In the first year, we'll use the Heaven and Earth Society to distribute fertilizer and pesticides to the countryside. Besides supplying members, we can also provide free samples to villages in the green and blue zones. By the second year, we'll be able to sell them throughout the county. Let the farmers transport it themselves. Volume and weight aren't an issue. The cost of these things is very low. The cost of local pesticides is basically just labor; the raw materials are all cheap stuff."

"However, Commissioner Wu, I don't understand why the regulations specify that we should only target 'managerial landlords.' Aren't all landlords just landlords?" Wan Lihui asked, puzzled.
