Lin Ming's shock subsided, and he continued to watch the "Australian movie." It was called a "play," but it had no real plot. The ten-minute film mostly consisted of street scenes and landscapes. Some of the scenes looked familiar to him, probably local scenery from Lingao. The film was played with music. But this effect was enough to excite the moviegoers and give them a taste of "Australian entertainment."

With this experience, Lin Ming was no longer a stranger to "Australian movies." The Wang Xinglong siblings often went to the cinema—of course, when they went together, they would never ask him to join them. As for why the siblings loved movies so much, Lin Ming's wisdom made it easy to figure out: it was dark in the cinema!

Meeting at the cinema, Lin Ming understood at once: it was an excellent location. Anyone could enter the cinema by buying a ticket, no registration was required, and there were many screenings every day, with each screening having anywhere from forty or fifty to several hundred people. The flow of people was complex. Most importantly, it was pitch black inside, making it difficult to monitor who was sitting with whom and what was being said.

He hadn't expected his sister-in-law to be so skilled in this area. She had been able to grasp and apply the minor details he had casually mentioned back then.

He deliberately continued to read the newspaper, secretly rolled the slip of paper into a ball, and swallowed it.

After a while, some people left and others arrived. After making sure his departure wouldn't attract attention, he returned the newspaper and got up to leave.

The streetlights were already lit. Lin Ming went back to the shop to change his shoes and then walked towards the cinema.

It was a workday, so there weren't many people at the cinema entrance. The cinema was a small two-story building with two screening halls. Hall 1 showed propaganda documentaries, and the price was very cheap. Ten cents per person, no assigned seats, and no time limit. Five short films were shown in rotation, each twenty minutes long. There was a show about every hour, with eight shows a day.

Hall 2 was dedicated to showing "internal reference films," which were actually popular science and technical short films. These films were generally not shown to the public and were mainly for the naturalized citizens from factories, government agencies, and schools to watch. Most of the viewings were booked in advance.

Lin Ming bought a ticket and went in. The screening hall was pitch black. Because there were no assigned seats, there were no ushers. You could sit wherever there was an empty seat. Lin Ming thought for a moment and sat in the last row where he could observe the entrance. This was the highest position, allowing him to conveniently observe the entire cinema. The key was that no one would pay attention to the last row while watching the movie.

He wasn't interested in what was being shown. He just carefully observed his surroundings for anything unusual.

A few minutes later, during the darkness when the film was being changed, a figure quietly sat down next to him.

Even without a word, he could smell the familiar, faint girlish fragrance. His heart couldn't help but stir. A thousand emotions and ten thousand sorrows welled up.

In the darkness, he remained motionless, not even turning his face. A warm, soft little hand had already reached out and placed itself on his knee. Lin Ming immediately grasped this hand tightly. A voice that was both strange and familiar came to his ear:

"Don't look at me. It's safe here. We have half an hour..."

Lin Ming squeezed her hand to show he understood. Although her little hand was still so soft, the touch was already a bit rough. She must have suffered here. Just as Lin Ming was about to speak, Li Yongxun spoke first:

"Brother Ming, are you well?"

That one sentence made half his body tingle and brought back endless memories. When she was in Foshan, she often called him that in private.

Thinking of those days, it was truly a wonderful time in Lin Ming's life: his home was full of beautiful women, his wife and concubines lived in harmony, and he had such a clever and witty sister-in-law. Comparing it to the present, his hatred for the 髡 grew even stronger. If they hadn't abducted Li Yongxun, how would things have become like this today!

"You've suffered, Sister Xun," he said in a low voice. "It's all my fault, I didn't take good care of you..."

"Don't say that, Brother Ming," Li Yongxun's voice was slightly choked. "This is all fate."

It was indeed a bit of fate. As they say, "no zuo no die." If Li Yongxun hadn't been so curious back then and insisted on tracking down the 髡, she would never have been captured by the Australians. If she knew that she had actually been seriously considered for secret execution by the State Security Bureau several times, she would probably have had a mental breakdown long ago.

Lin Ming shook his head slightly. "Let's not talk about it. Are you well in Lingao?"

Although he couldn't see his sister-in-law's face, he could hear a soft sniffle. She said, "I'm living very well here, it's just the longing in my heart..."

At this point, she sniffled again. "Don't worry, Brother Ming, I'm living very well here."

Lin Ming secretly savored the meaning of her words. He felt that his sister-in-law didn't seem to resent Lingao, but her longing for her family was very strong. There was a possibility of persuading her, so he took the opportunity to say, "I came to Lingao this time to take you away, Sister Xun."

Unexpectedly, as soon as he finished speaking, Li Yongxun had already refused. "Brother Ming, I... I can't leave..."

This was not unexpected for Lin Ming. His sister-in-law had "fallen" to Lingao. If she really wanted to escape, there should have been opportunities. The fact that she hadn't left clearly meant she had some unspeakable difficulties. To take her away, he had to resolve this knot in her heart.

But this was difficult to say. Lin Ming thought for a moment and said, "Sister Xun, it's not a long-term solution for you to stay in Lingao and work for the 髡. Not to mention your parents are still waiting for you in Nanjing—they are worried sick about your disappearance. And for you to go missing in Guangdong, your sister and I bear a great responsibility..."

As soon as he said this, Li Yongxun's hand trembled. Lin Ming secretly glanced at her. He saw her body bent over her knees, her hands covering her face, her shoulders shaking violently. It was clear that her heart was in great turmoil.

There's a chance. Lin Ming thought, no matter what her unspeakable difficulties or concerns were, family affection was always the most precious. As long as he could move her on this point, he could slowly work on it.

After a long while, Li Yongxun finally said, "Brother-in-law, just know that I am well here. And please bring a message to my parents for me, that I am well... I'm just sorry to them."

Lin Ming shook his head. "Sister Xun, are you so heartless?"

Li Yongxun did not answer, but asked in a low voice, "Brother Ming, have you found anything unusual here?"

Although this matter was unrelated to his purpose for coming, it was related to whether he could continue to hide in Lingao. He said, "The matter on the embankment..."

"That woman was not bait. I've already checked," Li Yongxun said. "She is indeed a prostitute."

Lin Ming shook his head slightly and told her in a low voice about the Jinyiwei personnel lurking in Lingao. "There are Jinyiwei people here. That prostitute was sent on a mission. The reason for the commotion was because I refused to make contact with her."

"Is that so?!" Li Yongxun was surprised.

"That's right. Someone understands our secret code—there are colleagues here!"

Even if Lin Ming didn't say it, Li Yongxun knew the situation had become complicated. Lin Ming had come to Lingao on a "private matter," with no other intentions towards the Australians, and naturally would not put himself in danger.

But with "colleagues," it was different. The Jinyiwei lurking in Lingao were either spies or plotting something. The group of people captured in the last major manhunt was very suspicious. Although she hadn't gotten any important information from the few interrogations she had participated in, it was an indisputable fact that someone had organized them to infiltrate Lingao.

Under heaven, besides the Ming government, there would be no second party who would dare to risk such great disapproval to send people to Lingao to plot something. Could this person be the "mastermind" who had not been caught?

If this person knew there was a "colleague" like Lin Ming in Lingao, he would definitely use blackmail to force him to carry out missions together. In that case, Lin Ming would be in deep danger—with the State Security Bureau's surveillance capabilities in Lingao, as long as their activities became frequent and they left enough clues, it was only a matter of time before they were caught.

Once Brother Ming was arrested, under the three wooden instruments, what confession could not be obtained? With the State Security Bureau's methods, no one who was still breathing could keep their mouth shut. He would definitely confess about her, and she would immediately be in a hopeless situation!

Li Yongxun broke out in a cold sweat. Even Lin Ming noticed her palm had turned cold. Just as he was about to comfort her, he heard her say slowly:

"Brother Ming, this person cannot be left alive..."

Lin Ming was secretly shocked. He hadn't expected that after a few years, his sister-in-law, this carefree and even a bit mischievous girl, had become so scheming and decisive.

Although her words were cruel, it was the safest thing to do right now. Otherwise, they would sooner or later be ruined together!

As for what great loss it would be to the court to kill this colleague who had risked his life to infiltrate Lingao, Lin Ming didn't care much.

However, killing a person was not an easy matter, especially under the rule of the 髡 in a place like Lingao. The less trouble, the better. Lin Ming thought for a moment and said, "Sister Xun, let's leave together. If you go back to Foshan with me, this matter will be over. He doesn't know my identity—besides, it's not certain he can even go back."

Li Yongxun shook her head and smiled bitterly. "Brother Ming, if you leave alone, you can still get away now. If you take me with you, you definitely won't be able to."

"As long as we find a way, we can always get away..." Hearing her words, Lin Ming was overjoyed and quickly said.

"No, we can't. You don't know how formidable the Australians are." As Li Yongxun said this, she subconsciously glanced around. "Brother Ming, you should go back early. But as long as you stay here for one day, don't do anything—as long as you do, the Australians will definitely find you."

Lin Ming didn't quite believe it, but seeing his sister-in-law so nervous, he thought her words were probably not an exaggeration. She was now working for the 髡, so she naturally knew the internal situation better than he did.

"If you don't go back, I won't go back either." Lin Ming had gone through so much trouble to come to Lingao and see his sister-in-law. How could he just go back like this?
