Wu De's other task was to prevent escapes. Once the laborers started working outside, it was highly likely that some would try to flee. He had to completely eliminate this possibility, as a single successful escape would give hope to others.

Therefore, before the outdoor labor began, he requested from the Executive Committee that the military group members assigned to guard the captives must be expert marksmen, preferably equipped with scopes and night vision goggles.

"Why do you need such skilled people?" He Ming found it a bit strange.

"To kill anyone who tries to escape with a single shot," Wu De explained. The more swift, decisive, and ruthless the suppression, the more effective it would be. Once the level of fear was high enough, guards would no longer be necessary.

Next, he broke up the group of those who had expressed willingness to join and scattered them among the various labor teams, instructing them to report directly to him if they heard any talk of escape.

He made no promises to these informants, nor did he offer any benefits. To gain his trust, they had to show the courage to fully commit to his side.

Perhaps it was because the battle had left such a strong impression on many, or perhaps because their former lives were not much different from their current ones, but aside from a few small landlords and rich peasants complaining that no one had come to ransom them and that their farm work was being neglected, there were no unusual reports.

Fu Buer, due to a leg injury, was not sent to work with the others but was recuperating in a tent with the other wounded. His days consisted of changing his dressings and eating. The food wasn't bad; the rice porridge was thin, but there was enough of it. Seeing the "pirate" medics in their white coats coming and going every day to tend to the wounded, Fu Buer was quite impressed. "Doctors are like parents," he thought. His fear gradually subsided.

There had been twenty to thirty wounded captives initially. Some had died after surgery, while others recovered quickly and were sent to the labor teams. Fu Buer's long-term laborer, Ma Peng, had only sprained his ankle and was sent away soon after. In the past, Fu Buer wouldn't have given Ma Peng a second glance, but now that he was gone, he felt a sense of loss. He was now surrounded by strangers.

A few days later, Ma Peng found an opportunity to visit him. He said he was now working for the pirates, whom he no longer called "pirates" but respectfully referred to as "the Chiefs." The term was new to Fu Buer. Ma Peng now spent his days felling trees and digging earth. He had white rice porridge for every meal and salted fish every two or three days. He worked for about six *shichen* (12 hours) a day. The only annoyance was being forced to bathe daily, but he had gotten used to it. All in all, life was tolerable. Hearing that the pirates provided white rice and fish surprised Fu Buer. At his own home, his long-term laborers were fed sweet potatoes year-round. Rice and salted fish were only given as a bonus during the busy farming season. Although it had nothing to do with him, he felt a pang of regret for the pirates' extravagance.

Ma Peng also spoke of many incredible things, like the self-propelled machine that could make thousands of bricks in a short time, and another roaring, smoke-belching contraption that the "Chiefs" forbade them from approaching. It was said to be the source of all power, constantly needing to be fed firewood, consuming more in a day than a whole village used for cooking. There were also stoves mounted on four-wheeled carts and magical saws that could fell a large tree in an instant...

As Ma Peng spoke excitedly, Fu Buer was not particularly surprised. He himself had seen many strange things these past few days and was mentally prepared for the pirates' novelties.

"...The Chief said that those who work well and are willing to stay can become 'staff members'."

"'Staff members'? Isn't that just being a pirate?"

"Not being a... pirate," Ma Peng whispered. "We're not qualified for that yet. It's called being a 'staff member.' I don't know how to write it, but it means three meals a day, with meat at every meal, and one day off a month..." Ma Peng's face showed a hint of envy.

"Hey! You want to join the rebels?" Fu Buer saw his laborer on the verge of falling into the abyss of rebellion. He didn't much care about Ma Peng's life or death, but he was afraid of losing a worker. He quickly reminded him that it was a dangerous path.

"I wouldn't dare. As you say, master, that's a beheading offense. But I've heard some are willing. Besides, even the county magistrate can't do anything about them now. What can we common folk do?" After working for the pirates for about ten days, Ma Peng seemed to have become more articulate. "It's all just work anyway..."

"Ma Peng, you're thinking foolishly!" Fu Buer scolded. "When the imperial army arrives, they'll all be turned to dust! If you side with the pirates, you'll be branded a rebel!"

Ma Peng opened his mouth but didn't seem to know what to say.

Fu Buer took the opportunity to ask if there was any news from his family. Ma Peng said he had been working constantly and hadn't seen anyone from the village. Moreover, the pirates' work sites were now numerous and vast, and he was often moved from one place to another, losing track of his location. Fu Buer was anxious. Even if they wanted a ransom, shouldn't they have sent someone to negotiate? Why was there no word from the pirates?

Ma Peng had to get back to work and left quickly. Fu Buer's leg had mostly healed, and he could walk. He had been afraid to go out, fearing the pirates would see him and cut him down for trying to escape. But seeing Ma Peng moving about freely, he used a stick as a crutch and ventured out of the tent. The tent was surrounded by barbed wire. The sight of it made him shudder. The memory of the bloody bodies hanging on the wire during the battle was too horrific to forget.

Outside the wire was a wooden watchtower, with a young pirate standing bored at its base, a musket with a bayonet slung over his back. Fu Buer had witnessed the power of these weapons. When fired, the shots were as dense as rain, and with each volley, a swath of men around him would fall. With such powerful firearms, not only would a militia like theirs be no match, but even the official army would have a tough time. However, Fu Buer also knew that hoping for the official army to rescue them was a dream. The Ming army couldn't be bothered with the lives of common people like them. If they did come to suppress the "bandits," they would probably be the first to be beheaded, their heads presented for rewards. He had heard countless such stories during his trips to Guangzhou—"guest armies are like bandits."

Suddenly, a strange roar filled the air, like the explosion of a firecracker, followed by a rumbling thunder. Looking towards the sound, he saw a red iron monster roaring, spewing black smoke, and chewing at the ground with incredible force. The sight was more terrifying than his worst nightmares. Fu Buer's face turned pale, and he nearly collapsed.

He watched as the iron plates creaked and the behemoth moved slowly. Then, with a roar, a giant iron shovel lifted from the ground, and dirt and rocks cascaded around it like a waterfall. The scene was breathtaking.

Fu Buer was speechless with astonishment. What could possibly stand against such power? Not the thousand-odd government troops of Qiongzhou Prefecture, not even the combined forces of several provinces. With such power, and engaging in such large-scale construction, what else could they be doing but preparing for a long-term stay?

At this thought, his mind became a chaotic mess. He couldn't tell if this was a blessing or a curse. He squatted on the ground, lost and bewildered.

Wu De took the latest issue of the "Captive Ideological Trends" report to the Executive Committee. The committee had high hopes for this group of captives, seeing them as the seeds for future political construction. Therefore, they required a weekly report on their ideological state to make corresponding policy adjustments.

The Executive Committee building—though in reality a simple prefabricated building, everyone habitually called it the "office building" for grandeur—had been completely transformed. The surrounding barbed wire had been removed and replaced with high walls. A guard post was set up in front of the wooden double doors. Two rows of single-story houses had been newly built on either side of the office building—since there were masons among the captives, building a few old-style brick-and-wood tile-roofed houses was no problem. The courtyard was paved with green bricks, and two flowerbeds had been built on either side. A Beijing 212 jeep was parked in the yard, along with a few scattered motorcycles and bicycles. At first glance, it looked very much like a county party committee compound from the 1960s or 70s.

Wu De did not enter the main building but went directly into a tile-roofed house on the east side. The white sign with black characters on the door read "Printing Room" in neat artistic script. This was where the Executive Committee edited and printed documents and various internal publications.

These internal publications had been edited since the Executive Committee moved to Bairen Beach. Although Ding Ding had been clamoring to start the "Lingao Times," the Executive Committee had consistently rejected his request on the grounds that the time was not yet right, instead putting him in charge of internal publications. These publications ranged from those for all transmigrators to those restricted to the Executive Committee. "Captive Ideological Trends" was a restricted material for the Executive Committee and the theoretical policy group, with only five copies printed per issue.

The printing room was dark. To save electricity, the lights were kept off unless necessary for work. The room was large, containing a high-speed mimeograph machine. A large table taken from the ship was covered with wax paper, steel plates, and styluses. In the corner were two computers and several Epson 24-pin printers. Boxes of white paper and stacks of printed documents were piled against the wall.

The room was empty. Wu De casually picked up a proof sheet from the table. It looked like a single-sheet tabloid. The front page had two large, crooked, tadpole-like characters written with a brush. On closer inspection, it was "Lingao Express," with a signature below: "Inscribed by Xi Yazhou."

Xi Yazhou's head seemed to have healed; he was already inscribing for publications. Wu De began to read. The newspaper reported in great detail on the victory of the "First Counter-Encirclement Campaign," exaggerating that the local government had dispatched a large army of three thousand men, but under the divine might of our heavenly army, they were all annihilated in just half a *shichen* (one hour). Although the author was listed as the paper's military commentator, the wargame-like writing style was clearly the work of Xi Yazhou, who had been unfortunately wounded on D-Day.

Next was an editorial, signed: "Special Commentator for this Newspaper." It commented: "The reactionary Ming government will inevitably be completely eliminated by our wise and great Transmigration Party."

Following that was a theoretical article introducing Marxism. Of course, this Mr. Ma had become a hermit born in the Wanli era. The author was Du Wen. However, although the article was long and cited many numbers, Wu De could not understand what it was about. He estimated that even Marx himself wouldn't know if he read it.

At the bottom of the page was another article, "The Bloody Tears and Accusations of the Lingao Peasants," which described the tragic experiences of many peasants. Wu De found it very familiar—wasn't this just excerpts from the "Summary of Captive Interrogations" that Guo Yi had sent him? It was truly a case of "all articles under heaven are plagiarized." Many details had been added with embellishments, and the imagination was simply outrageous. The author had consciously chosen not to sign their name.
