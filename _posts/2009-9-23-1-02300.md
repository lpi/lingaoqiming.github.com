Spring in the City of Five Rams was gradually coming to an end, yet the weather showed no sign of warming. Gao Qing sat in the courtyard, staring blankly at the sky. It had been almost two months since he had become a servant to the Australian masters.

After he was assigned, Master Gao had specifically instructed him to report back on the Australian masters' every move. He had also promised that if the Australian masters left and never returned, or if something went wrong, he would still take his family back and would certainly not let them become destitute on the streets.

He and his wife had also discussed several times what would happen if the Australian masters wanted to take them back to Australia. At that time, they didn't know if they could beg the masters to let their family stay.

These Australian masters were indeed kind to their servants. Knowing his family's hardship, they gave him extra monthly rice and also gave his son a monthly allowance. But they were, after all, foreign sea merchants and would have to go back one day. If they really wanted to take them back to Australia, what should they do? Logically speaking, these masters were his family's masters. Wherever the master went, the servant had to follow. It was only natural. But he did not want to be uprooted from his home again—he had already left his homeland when he fled the famine and sold himself into servitude. If he really went to that Australia, tens of thousands of li away... that Australia was undoubtedly a barbaric land. Even if they had some strange and ingenious objects, how could it compare to China? Although this city of Guangzhou was not his hometown, he had lived here for these years and was still very attached to it.

Thinking about it over and over, he was extremely troubled. He had been in Master Gao's house for many years and knew that the Frankish sea merchants would set sail with the wind in June. The Australian sea merchants would probably leave around the same time—would they want to take his family with them?

He sighed again and squinted at the gate of the backyard. Manager Yan would be coming over soon. Counting the days, the Australian masters were due to arrive in the next few days.

In these two months, the three masters would come once every half a month or so and stay for several days. Each time, he never knew when they arrived or how they got into the house. It was always when the sky was bright that he would see the gate of the courtyard where the masters lived was already open, and piles of goods were stacked in the hall and under the eaves.

This always made him feel very mysterious, and with the mystery came a bit of fear. Although Master Gao had hinted or explicitly stated, and had also promised him benefits, that he should find out the details of the Australian sea merchants, he had never dared to do so—it was not difficult to sneak into the courtyard, but what if he saw something he shouldn't see...

Gao Qing knew that the most important thing for a servant was to never know what he was not supposed to know. It didn't matter if the master was from the Great Ming or from Australia.

Gao Di, however, did not understand his father's thoughts. He came running over and asked, "Dad, Mom is asking you: when are the masters coming, so she can prepare the meals. Last time, Master Wang even said he wanted to have a good meal and taste the dishes of the Great Ming."

"It should be in these few days, the time is about right." Gao Ju counted on his fingers for a long time. "Are your account books all ready?"

"They are all ready. At the end of last month, the masters all looked at them and even praised me for keeping them complete and being meticulous." Gao Di proudly raised his neck. "Master Wang even helped me correct the wrong characters. That Master Xiao said he would teach me something called Arabic numerals in the future, which are even faster for calculation than what the accountants use."

"Good, good, as long as the masters like it," Gao Qing said vaguely. It was a good thing that the children were favored by the masters. If the masters were Chinese, it would be a good placement for his children, but—alas! They were foreigners. Even if they didn't take the whole family with them, but only one or two of his children, he would be reluctant to part with them.

"I think that [Master Wen][y002] likes sister very much. He always calls sister over to talk and has given her some things. Will he take sister as a concubine?"

These words hit Gao Qing's heart heavily. With a sullen face, he thought for a long time before saying, "It depends on her fate." But in his heart, he was not willing.

As he was brooding, he heard the gate creak. It was Manager Yan. Gao Qing hurriedly went to greet him, invited him to sit at the stone table in the courtyard, and sent his son to fetch tea and dried fruit.

"Old Gao, the Australian sea merchants are coming again in a few days. What about the matter the master instructed you to do?" Manager Yan did not stand on ceremony and got straight to the point.

"Replying to you, sir, I really can't find out anything." Gao Qing knew that this conversation was inevitable. "Those masters are very vigilant and never let anyone follow them into their rooms to serve them. And every time, they come and go without a trace."

"It's been two months, and you're still saying the same few words over and over. You really are a fucking piece of trash." Manager Yan had always been Master Gao's confidant and had never paid any attention to a low-level servant like Gao Qing who didn't even have the qualification to enter the inner courtyard. He spoke without any restraint.

"Yes, yes, I am stupid."

"How do you expect me to report back to the master?" Manager Yan rolled his eyes. "The master is very dissatisfied with you..."

"Then I must ask Manager Yan to bear with me, to put in a good word..." Gao Qing panicked a little. He fumbled at his waist for a long time and took out two qian of silver—this was what he had saved up in the past two months, intending to buy some cloth for his two children to make clothes. At this moment, Manager Yan's half-true, half-false words scared him. Although he was no longer a slave of the Gao family, he did not dare to entrust his fate to the Australian masters.

Manager Yan took it smoothly, weighed it slightly, and stuffed it into his sleeve: "On the master's side, I will help you deal with it for now. But this matter, you can hide from it on the first day, but you can't hide from it on the fifteenth. No matter what, you have to find out the details of these people!"

"Yes, yes, I understand."

"As soon as the sea merchants arrive, immediately invite them over. At any time."

"Yes, I know."

Manager Yan left after saying that. Gao Qing wiped the sweat from his forehead, his brows furrowed even tighter. To spy for Master Gao would ultimately offend his current masters. Not to mention that the Australian masters were benevolent, his doing so would be an act of ingratitude. Just the act of prying into and selling out his master's secrets was a crime of betraying one's master. It was probably a serious crime no matter where one went. Even if he didn't die, he would be skinned alive. If he ignored Master Gao's instructions, there would be no way to seek refuge with him in the future, not to mention that it would be effortless for Master Gao to deal with a slave like him.

As he was lost in thought, he saw his sworn brother from the Gao family, Gao Chang, coming over, carrying a large food box filled with smoked and cured snacks that Master Gao had sent for the Australian masters. Gao Qing forced himself to cheer up, called his wife and daughter out to receive it, and went to the kitchen to put it away.

"Did that scoundrel Manager Yan come to extort you again, brother?" Gao Chang was a strong young man of twenty-five or six. He was from the same hometown as Gao Qing and had also fled to Guangzhou because he couldn't make a living at home. He had sold himself to the Gao family with Gao Qing as his guarantor. They both worked as general servants in the outer courtyard. Since they were from the same hometown and looked out for each other, they had privately become sworn brothers.

"Alas," Gao Qing said, pouring out his troubles.

"Brother, you are too cowardly," Gao Chang said indignantly. "You are now the Australian masters' man. Why do you bother with him? The masters are benevolent and have let you save up a few coins, yet you go and stuff that dog's hole!"

"Brother, don't say any more. It's a long story." Gao Qing looked at the sky above the courtyard wall. "This family... I'm afraid we will still have to rely on Master Gao in the future." After saying that, he refused to say more.

"That's strange. The deeds of sale for your whole family have been given to the Australian masters. Why do you want to rely on Master Gao again? Could it be that the masters don't want you anymore?"

"That's not it. The masters have been nothing but good to our family. They are kind and speak gently. They are all good people."

"Then why do you want to go back to the Gao family? Brother, in the Gao family, you are just a servant of servants. How can it compare to being half a manager now? I even envy you for having such good luck."

"But they are foreign sea merchants after all!"

"So what? They are not red-haired, green-eyed Franks, who are hairy and smelly." Gao Chang was dismissive. "Although it's hard to understand what the masters are saying, and their clothes are strange, they are still Chinese people after all."

"They will have to leave one day, right? What if they want to take the whole family with them?"

Gao Chang suddenly understood. So this was what his sworn brother was worried about. He didn't care about such things: he had been an orphan since he was a child, a bachelor with no ties, and it was the same for him wherever he went. But his sworn brother had a family to support, and thinking from his perspective, it was indeed a matter of looking before and after.

"Brother's concerns are valid. But in my humble opinion, if they go, then just go. This Great Ming is good, but it is not our Great Ming. Here we are slaves, and in Australia we will also be slaves. How much worse can it get? These masters are kind-hearted. If your whole family follows them, you will certainly not suffer a loss." He smiled, "If I were you, brother, if they go, I would follow. It would be good to see the customs of this Little China overseas."

"What you say is true, brother, but I don't want to die in a foreign land." Gao Qing let out a long sigh. "Back then, during the famine in my hometown, in order to find a way to live, I abandoned my old house and ancestral graves and fled. I was lucky enough to be taken in by Master Gao and came here. In a flash, more than ten years have passed. The house, the ancestral graves, are probably all gone... I have already given up the idea of returning to my hometown..." As he spoke, tears streamed down his face, and his voice was choked with sobs. "I am already over forty. When the mountains are high and the waters are low, it is time for a person to go. If I have to be buried overseas in my old age, I will truly not be able to die in peace."

Gao Chang saw his sworn brother's sadness and quickly comforted him with a few words. But in his heart, he did not agree. When a slave of the Gao family died, only those with some status could, with the master's reward and their own savings, have a Daoist or Buddhist ceremony and buy a piece of land for burial. An ordinary slave would only be given a thin coffin and be carried to the public cemetery outside the city to be buried haphazardly. His sworn brother wanted to stay here, was it just for these things after death? He couldn't help but feel extremely desolate.

This muddle-headed young man who had been a slave his whole life, for the first time in more than twenty years, a glimmer of light flashed in his heart: This world, perhaps it shouldn't be like this...
