The southern city of Guangzhou faces the Pearl River and is a place where sea merchants and foreign ships dock. In the Song Dynasty, the southern city had already become a commercial center, protected by the east and west Yanchi (Goose Wing) cities. It was destroyed by war in the Yuan Dynasty. After entering the Ming Dynasty, commerce here flourished, but after the Tuolin army mutiny, the residents outside the city suffered, and the government built a new city on the old site of the Yanchi cities. The "Guangdong Tongzhi" states: "In the 42nd year of Jiajing, the year of Jiazi, the Censor-in-Chief Wu Guifang, due to the Tuolin army mutiny and the trampling of the residents outside the city, initiated the construction of a new city from the southwest corner tower to the Wuyang post station, circling around to the southeast corner tower, for the purpose of defense."

With the protection of the city walls, the new southern city, although facing the Pearl River and surrounded by moats on three sides, was the smallest in area among the three cities of Guangzhou Prefecture. But the foreign ship area, the wharf area, the commercial area, and the wealthy residential area were all concentrated here, making it the commercial and economic center of Guangzhou.

At this time, on the bank of the Pearl River outside the Jinghai Gate of the southern city, stood several people, wearing straw raincoats and bamboo hats, seemingly on patrol.

The sky was overcast, and a misty rain was falling. On the river, a dozen or so sailboats were faintly visible, their silhouettes dark and clustered in the thick water mist. Looking into the distance at Shicui Island and the White Goose Pond, they were hidden in the dense mist and waves, as if connected to the clouds and sky.

"Damn it, where did these Australian sea ships come from?" one of them spat and said resentfully.

"Boss Wang, we've been searching for ten days now, and we've looked at all the various sea ships along the river, but there's no strange big ship."

The man called Boss Wang did not answer, but stared for a long time in silence. In the center of the river, ripples circled, and old fish blew waves. Under the riverbank were rugged rocks, against which the turbid waves crashed. Not far from them, a foreign ship was unloading cargo. A group of porters carried goods on their shoulders from the side of the ship to the warehouse on the wharf.

"Big Brother Wang, I really don't understand. The master is doing well in the Central-Left Guard, why did he suddenly get the idea to send us to find some Australian sea merchants? I have followed the master for these years, and have traveled to the East and West Seas, but I have never heard of any damn Australia!"

That Boss Wang snorted coldly and rebuked, "What are you blabbering about? What place is this?! Don't you want your head anymore?"

Hearing this, everyone fell silent.

After a long while, Boss Wang was heard to say: "Although Australia is a place we have never heard of, the things sold in the Gao family's shop on Haopan Street didn't just fall from the sky, did they? The whole city of Guangzhou is in a frenzy right now. Who doesn't know about the strange goods from Australia? Since this kind of profitable business passes through the sea, how can we brothers not make a good fortune from it?" He grinned sinisterly. "This time, we must find out the background of this group of sea merchants."

It turned out that these people were the subordinates of the "great pirate" Zheng Zhilong, who was currently plundering Fujian and shaking the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. At this moment, he, along with Li Kuiqi, had gathered a force of more than thirty thousand men and occupied a series of important coastal islands and ports in southern Fujian, such as Zhongzuo, Gulangyu, Dadan, Lieyu, and Gaopu. They either plundered merchant ships and extorted protection money, or made sudden raids into the mainland, burning, killing, and looting, and had already become a hegemon on the seas of the southern Fujian coast.

The group walked along the wharf towards the city. Gradually, they saw more pedestrians and vendors. After passing the Dragon King Temple, they saw the Jinghai Gate tower. Entering the city, they walked along the road towards the Wuyang Gate. In front of them was a magnificent great temple, the Tianfei Temple built in the Hongwu reign. This was the transportation center of the southern city, a place where people from all five directions gathered. All sorts of people, mixed with sedan chairs and mule carts, bustled back and forth. Merchants gathered, and the market was lively. There was a clamor of voices, and endless rows of stalls, a scene of prosperous trade.

This Boss Wang was obviously very cautious. He only walked along the base of the wall, turned a corner, and went into an alley. At the base of the city wall was a small tavern, with a greasy and dirty half-drawn bamboo curtain hanging. The group slipped into the tavern. A few oil lamps hung in the tavern, and it was very dim even during the day. The customers were in a noisy uproar. The floor was wet and slippery, filled with a strange smell mixed with the aroma of food, wine, oily smoke, and sweat.

The waiter saw someone come in and hurried over to greet the customers. Boss Wang asked for a private room, and ordered some wine and dishes. The curtain was not completely lowered, but was tied up halfway, so that the brothers sitting at the door could have a full view of the whole tavern.

After waiting for a moment, another figure who looked like a street loafer walked in through the tavern door. He was a fair-faced, beardless middle-aged man. Their eyes met, and the newcomer came in and sat down without any pleasantries. The group just ate and drank on their own. Seeing that there were no plainclothes constables in the tavern, Boss Wang then asked in a low voice, "Is there any news from the brothers on Haopan Street?"

"We've been tailing them for almost half a month, but there's nothing useful. We've only seen goods being carried out of the Gao residence in one load after another and sent to the shops, but we've never seen any special goods go in, nor have we seen any strange people."

"Damn it!" This Boss Wang had no appetite for food, staring at a plate of hot and fragrant stir-fried snake with scallions. "How did so much cargo get in?" Could it be a diversion? Were the Australian goods not transported from the Gao family, but this was just a means to cover it up?

"What about the Gao family's warehouse at the wharf?"

"We've asked about that too," he shook his head. "The rules in the Gao family's shop are very strict, and we can't find out anything. The brothers asked around for many days and only found out that the manager of the warehouse has a lover who is a prostitute. It took some silver to get some news from that woman." He then stopped talking and drank his wine on his own.

Boss Wang knew that this local rat was taking the opportunity to extort money again. He cursed in his heart, but only said, "The silver is not a problem. What did you find out?"

"The manager said that the Australian goods are never received or dispatched at the warehouse. They are all dispatched from Gao Ju's private warehouse in his main residence. Each time, not much is dispatched, only a few boxes of goods. But each item is worth a lot of money." As the middle-aged man spoke, a greedy look appeared in his eyes.

"How often are the goods dispatched?"

"There's no fixed time, but it's usually around every ten days."

This showed that the goods did indeed come from the Gao residence, but how did they get in? The Gao family was not by the sea, and ships could not sail in. Did they fall from the sky?

"Have you investigated the goods transported into the Gao residence?"

"For this matter, we asked Feijiao Laosan from the porters' guild for help. He asked for a lot of money..."

"No problem," Boss Wang said, but he touched the short knife in his sleeve.

"He asked for ten taels of silver," the middle-aged man squinted at Boss Wang, testing his reaction. Boss Wang had a blank smile on his face and did not answer, but glanced at the few people around him, who were all sneering. The man suddenly remembered who the people sitting in front of him were and quickly continued, "Feijiao Laosan ordered his men to secretly inspect the goods transported into the Gao family, and indeed there was something strange!"

"Oh? Were the goods smuggled in?"

"No, no, it's that the goods transported in and out are a bit strange."

They had bribed the porters' guild and secretly inspected the bulk goods transported in and out of the Gao residence for a month. In the past, the goods transported in were mainly porcelain, ironware, and the like, and the goods transported out were roughly the same. But this month was different. In addition to these, a lot of musk, ambergris, and sandalwood were also transported inâ€”the strangest thing was that they were never transported out, as if they had vanished into thin air once they went in.

After investigating for a long time, they still hadn't figured out where they came from. Boss Wang sighed in disappointment. If even these local city foxes and den rats couldn't find out anything, it would probably be even harder for him to find out on his own.

He took out a dozen or so silver dollars and sent him away. The group all found it hard to believe. They had been sneaking around Guangzhou for a month, going through countless troubles, and had found out so far that although they knew roughly where these sea merchants were staying, they still knew nothing about where their ships were docked or how their goods were transported. For now, they could only wait for the report from the men sent to infiltrate the Gao family a few days ago.

After waiting for a long time, the two men who were supposed to infiltrate the Gao residence yesterday finally came back, one with a bruise on his face. Seeing his expression change uncertainly, Boss Wang knew that things were not good.

"The back street over there has a fence, so it's not convenient to get in. We went up on the city wall and circled around, and after hiding there for a few days, we finally discovered something strange." These two men were famous thieves on the streets before. Because they had committed murder, they were wanted by the authorities and had to seek refuge with the sea pirates. This time, to bring them to Guangzhou for this risky venture, the Zheng family had promised a large sum of money.

They had observed the people and cargo going in and out of the back gate of the Gao residence from the city wall and found that they were all coming from the backyard of another house. So they found a way to get into that yard to have a look and saw the Australian sea merchants.

"There were four of them in total, all wearing the clothes of this dynasty, but with shorn hair, like monks."

Knowing that there was something strange about this courtyard, they observed it for another two days and found that it was originally a secret residence of the Gao family, and was now being used as a guesthouse for the Australian sea merchants. All the goods were transported from this secret residence to the Gao family, and the Gao family also transported goods to the secret residence.

So the problem came back to the beginning. They still hadn't found out where this group of sea merchants' goods came from.

"I originally wanted to listen to their conversation, but what a pity!" the one with the bruise on his face said fiercely. "There's a martial artist among them. As soon as I tried to get close, he discovered me and threw a rock, fast and hard."

"I say, let's just go all the way," someone said in a low voice. "Let's just 'scoop them out of their nest.' We'll grab the Gao family's Manager Yan, or even Gao Ju himself. Won't we be able to ask everything clearly then!"

Boss Wang snorted: "Grab them? Which of the merchants on Haopan Street is easy to mess with? Not to mention their connections reaching to the heavens, just the household guards they keep are enough to give you a hard time."

"Then let's grab one of the sea merchants," that person chuckled. "Even if we don't mess with the Gao family, it shouldn't be a problem to mess with these rootless sea merchants, right? I heard from Big Brother He that there's only one martial artist among them, and they don't have the Gao family's guards. Even if he's made of iron, how many nails can he make? We'll gather a few more brothers with good skills, go in and tie one up, take him to the ship. Not to mention coming from Australia, even if he came from Mount Kunlun, he'd have to talk. Besides," he laughed greedily, "if we want to let him go, won't he have to give us some good things?"

Everyone roared in approval at this. They all looked at Boss Wang. Boss Wang thought this was not a bad idea. Kidnapping a sea merchant was not a big deal. Gao Ju would not necessarily be furious about it, and they could still leave some room for maneuver in the future.

At this thought, the few of them put their heads together and began to plot.
