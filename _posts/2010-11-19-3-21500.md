Wu Mingjin paid him no mind. Soon, a servant brought in two porcelain cups. Wang Ci could not refuse. He accepted one and felt the cool, slightly damp touch of the cup. Lifting the lid, he saw that the liquid was a faint green, with strings of fine, pearl-like bubbles rising from the bottom.

Several pieces of crushed ice floated in the cup, clinking crisply against each other.

"Come, drink this to cool down!" Wu Mingjin said, taking a sip himself with a look of great satisfaction.

Wang Ci usually adhered to the principles of health preservation and abstained from iced drinks. But he could not refuse a gift from his superior. He took a small sip.

The taste was at once sweet and sour, with a refreshing aftertaste of mint. There was a tingling sensation, as if many tiny things were bursting in his mouth. It was a peculiar feeling.

He swallowed, and a cool comfort spread through his body. He couldn't resist taking a second sip.

"You have to drink this kvass in one go. If the fizz is gone, it loses its flavor," Wu Mingjin said, a self-proclaimed connoisseur of Lingao's high-society fashion.

The weather was indeed hot, and Wang Ci quickly finished his drink. He suddenly felt a bubble of gas rising in his stomach, quickly covered his mouth with his sleeve, and let out a few burps. His body instantly felt much cooler and refreshed. It was truly a great thirst-quencher! It must be another Australian product, Wang Ci thought.

Wang Ci composed himself and reported on Xiong Buyou's visit, mentioning the Australians' plan to repair the county school and the Jasmine Pavilion.

"This subordinate believes this is a matter of great importance and requests the magistrate's instruction."

Wu Mingjin was already displeased with Wang Ci's unilateral decision to lease the school lands to the "Tiandihui." He had heard that the education official was constantly complaining about his poverty and soliciting donations, always mentioning how the county had no money or rice for him. While this was true, it was a great loss of face for the leadership. Besides, the county truly had no money.

Wu Mingjin snorted. "What can I do? Since the school lands are in their hands, it's only natural that they should repair the Confucian temple and county school." He took a cigarette from a turned wooden case. A nearby servant quickly brought a paper spill to light it for him.

Wang Ci was greatly embarrassed. His political acumen was not high, and he hadn't realized his past complaints had offended his superior. He thought the magistrate was angry at him for leasing the school lands to the Tiandihui on his own authority. He quickly stood up and said, "It was my foolishness..."

"The county has no money for this now. Since they want to repair it, let them." Wu Mingjin had adopted a completely hands-off attitude towards the髡-thieves' activities. No matter what, they would do what they wanted, and any resistance from him would be like a praying mantis trying to stop a chariot.

Wang Ci got no guidance from Wu Mingjin, but he did get a glimpse of the magistrate's recent "Australian enjoyments." He wanted to see Master Wang, the advisor, but the servant said the advisor was taking a nap and not seeing guests. Dejected, he returned to the county school.

As he entered the Lingxing Gate, he saw the gatekeeper busy by a yellow-mud stove outside the gatehouse, seemingly cooking something. He was tearing pages from a book and feeding them into the stove to start the fire. Suddenly, a half-burnt piece of paper fluttered onto Wang Ci's chest. He casually grabbed it, about to toss it away, when his eyes widened.

It was a page from the *Analects*!

He had only ordered the髡-thieves' books to be burned, not the *Analects*. While the Four Books and Five Classics were not rare, they were impossible to buy in Lingao and had to be brought from the prefectural city! To use them as firewood—

Wang Ci nearly fainted from anger. He was about to rush over and berate the man when he froze.

This copy of the *Analects* was horizontally printed!

In the Great Ming, besides these髡-thieves, no one else printed books horizontally!

So the fifty books the髡-thieves had sent were not those strange *Literacy Primers*, but "proper books" like the Four Books and Five Classics! At this thought, he mustered all his strength and roared:

"Stop!"

Wang Ci sat in the hall, a rattan box at his feet. Inside were the books that had survived the ordeal, rescued from the flames of Vulcan. The gatekeeper, in his attempt to boil water, had already burned several of them. The gatekeeper was thoroughly confused by Wang Ci's behavior—first forcing him to burn the books, then rushing over like a madman to stop him. He could only conclude that the heat had muddled Master Wang's mind.

Wang Ci paid no mind to what the gatekeeper thought and quickly began to examine the books one by one.

The box contained mostly the "Thirteen Classics," the thirteen canonical works of Confucianism, including the *Book of Documents*, the *Rites of Zhou*, the *Analects*, *Mencius*, and the *Erya*. These were the foundation of the imperial examinations in the past. Anyone who could read all thirteen was considered an intellectual in ancient times.

The box had originally contained a complete set of the Thirteen Classics, but the gatekeeper had already burned several volumes. This set, apart from opening from the right and being printed horizontally, had no simplified characters and was exquisitely printed. The lines that usually separated the rows of characters in books were completely absent, yet the characters were perfectly aligned, both vertically and horizontally. The effect of black characters on a pure white background was something Wang Ci had never seen, not even in the finest Song dynasty editions he had encountered. He had no idea how the Australians had achieved this.

The only thing Wang Ci found improper was the addition of punctuation. Of course, this greatly simplified reading, but he had no confidence in the Australians' punctuation. How could these overseas barbarians possibly grasp the sage's meaning?

He picked a volume at random and saw that the punctuation was flawless. Wang Ci was astonished. The Australians were not so crude after all!

The more he thought about it, the more confused he became. He looked at the other books in the box and found a set of commentaries on the Thirteen Classics. In reality, this was a pirated version of the Zhonghua Book Company's *Collected Commentaries on the Thirteen Classics by Qing Scholars*. Throughout history, many had written commentaries on the Thirteen Classics, and the Qing dynasty represented a new peak in this field, especially in the exegesis of the texts and the study of names and institutions, surpassing previous eras. When Zhou Dongtian chose what to pirate, he had two considerations: first, it must have high academic merit, and second, it could not be a work from a previous dynasty—that would not showcase the Crossing Group's abilities. Thus, the research of the Qing dynasty was the first to be appropriated.

He had, of course, read commentaries on the Thirteen Classics before, but this was the first time he had seen this particular work. Naturally, he assumed the commentary was written by the Australians themselves. After reading a few pages, he couldn't help but slam the table in admiration—the quality of the commentary was in no way inferior to the Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasty commentators he had read. Wang Ci was bewildered.

If the Australians were a bunch of crude and ignorant fellows, their level of classical scholarship was clearly not low. If they were very learned, why did they use simplified characters and write in such a crude style?

"What a strange group of people," Wang Ci muttered, feeling more and more confused. Could it be that the true great scholars had remained in Australia and not come out? But if such great scholars existed, how could they tolerate the chaotic behavior of these people? He had no idea who was the king of the Australians.

As he continued to browse, he was stunned again—he saw the *Great Dictionary*. This was, in fact, a proofread version of the *Kangxi Dictionary* published by the Zhonghua Book Company. Of course, the name Kangxi was absent. The *Kangxi Dictionary* was based on two Ming dynasty dictionaries, the *Zihui* and the *Zhengzitong*, with additions and "corrections of doubts and errors." However, at this time, the *Zhengzitong* had not yet been completed—it would not be officially published until the end of the Chongzhen reign. The version pirated by the transmigrators was not only the collated edition from the Daoguang period but also included modern scholarly corrections. This dictionary, a grand compilation of ancient and modern scholarship, left Wang Ci deeply shaken. After reading a few pages, he felt the Australians were truly unfathomable.

These books were not only meticulously proofread but also so beautifully printed that he couldn't put them down. Scholars have a habit of loving books. When Wang Ci came to take up his post, despite the long journey, he had his attendant carry a box of books for him. Seeing this box of books, Wang Ci's heart was filled with greed. In any case, it was a gift to him, so it was only natural to claim it as his own.

At this thought, his wariness towards Xiong Buyou lessened considerably. His mindset shifted to align with Wu Mingjin's—since he couldn't stop them anyway, he might as well let them do it. It was, after all, beneficial to Lingao.

With this thought in mind, when Xiong Buyou came again the next day, Wang Ci's attitude was much more cooperative. Wang Ci was then presented with a second gift—a stipend.

In the past, when the Crossing Group distributed stipends to the county yamen staff, they had unfortunately forgotten Wang Ci—first, because he didn't work in the yamen, and second, because most modern people had no idea that a county even had an education official. Fortunately, it was not too late to correct this oversight.

Wang Ci, as was proper, declined several times. However, as Xiong Buyou had predicted, officials of this era clearly did not view such income as a sin. Furthermore, given the education official's dire straits, he was in great need of the money.

The next day, the construction team from the Lingao Construction Company moved into the Jasmine Pavilion. This famous Song dynasty structure had been but a small thatched hut in the early Ming. It wasn't until 1455 that it was rebuilt as the "Great Tiled Pavilion" and became a proper academy.

The Jasmine Pavilion was not large in scale, but it was not simple: stone pillars, glazed tiles, and carved beams and painted rafters showed that a great deal of effort had gone into its construction.

Although it had been repaired several times over the past two hundred years, it was, after all, an old building. An inspection revealed that the wooden structure was severely decayed. The walls and roof were also damaged and leaking in many places—it was in a state of utter ruin. There were no specialists in ancient architecture among the transmigrators, but fortunately, the Lingao Construction Company had already recruited many contemporary carpenters from the immigrants, so repairing the building was not a problem.

The timber, bricks, tiles, and lime needed for the renovation of the Jasmine Pavilion were a piece of cake for the Crossing Group. With ample materials, available workers, and the on-site management of modern construction supervisors, the entire dismantling, replacement, and renovation of the Jasmine Pavilion was completed in less than five days. A week later, the main structure of the Jasmine Pavilion had been restored to its former appearance, and the painting work began.
