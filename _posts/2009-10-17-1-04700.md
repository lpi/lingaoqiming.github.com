The evening sky was a tranquil, hazy yellow, the horizon a line of molten gold. A gentle sea breeze whispered across the deck of the *Fengcheng* as it sailed steadily through the calm waters of the Qiongzhou Strait. From the ship, the coastlines of the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island were visible, two dark ribbons separating the sea from the sky.

Beside the freighter, a squat, flat-decked barge, laden with containers and vehicles, kept pace. The two ships, along with a flotilla of four fishing boats and a landing craft, were proceeding at a speed of ten knots, a strange and motley fleet on a voyage to another world.

The loading process had been a logistical nightmare, a complex dance of cranes and cargo that had taken over half a month to complete. The hired Filipino crew, their English a strange and impenetrable dialect, had watched with indifference as the ships were filled with a bizarre assortment of goods and a small army of backpackers in green training uniforms.

The transmigrators, two-thirds of them concentrated on the freighter, had little space to themselves. The cargo holds were full, the decks cluttered with containers and the foul-smelling animal crates. Most sat on the open deck, their excitement a palpable energy that transcended the discomfort. Some slept, curled in their sleeping bags, while others stood at the rails, their gazes fixed on the receding coastline of their old world, a silent, final farewell.

On the sterncastle, the members of the Executive Committee had no time for sentiment. They scanned the sea with binoculars, their faces etched with a mixture of anticipation and anxiety. At 17:00, they were scheduled to rendezvous with the legendary yacht from the North American branch.

It arrived ten minutes early, a vision of blue and white, its sails full against the evening sky. A cheer went up from the transmigrators. On the yacht's deck, Shi Niaoren waved, and from a hatch, a foreign woman with wide, bewildered eyes emerged.

"Nice figure," [Wang Luobin][y003] muttered, his binoculars fixed on the newcomer.

"A Latina," someone else observed. A dozen pairs of binoculars swiveled to focus on the woman, ignoring the men from the North American branch who were still waving from the deck.

The fishing boats and landing craft arrived twenty minutes later, their progress slowed by the large floating rafts they were towing. The strange fleet was now complete. As night fell, the lights of Bopu Port twinkled in the distance.

"GPS shows we are three nautical miles northeast of Bopu Port."

"Reduce speed! All lights on!"

"Take over the ship!"

With a series of commands, Meng De, in his capacity as shipowner, gathered the Filipino crew on the deck. The military group, their shotguns now visible, supervised as the crew, without argument, boarded a lifeboat and rowed toward the shore.

The ship's powerful searchlights blazed to life, illuminating the deck in a harsh, artificial daylight. A voice, high-pitched and tinny, crackled over the loudspeakers: "Attention! Five minutes to transmigration! All personnel, put on life jackets and get inside the cabins!"

The transmigrators scrambled for cover, the watertight doors sealing them in.

"Let's begin," [Wen Desi][y002] said, his voice tight.

At the bow, the wormhole shimmered into existence, a vast, swirling mirror of light. The ship pushed forward, its prow touching the surface of the portal.

"Hold on," [Wen Desi][y002] whispered, a silent prayer on his lips.

"All ships, attention!" Meng De roared. "Full speed through the wormhole! All hands, prepare for impact!"

In the cabins, the transmigrators braced themselves. The lights flickered, a wave of static tingling their skin. A strange, disorienting dizziness washed over them.

"We're through!" someone shouted.

The last fishing boat cleared the portal. The wormhole, which had been a flat, shimmering plane, suddenly expanded into a blinding sphere of light, and then, with a sound like a thunderclap, it vanished. Seawater rushed into the void, a massive wave erupting from the roiling chaos.

"All ships, report status!" Meng De yelled into the radio.

"Barge, normal!"

"Landing craft, normal!"

"Fishing 1, normal!"

...

"North America, normal... wait! There's a motorboat approaching at high speed!"

A collective gasp went through the committee. A motorboat? In the 17th century?

Before [Wen Desi][y002] could react, Xi Yazhou was already on the communicator, dispatching two of the fishing boats to intercept. The *Fengcheng*'s searchlights swept across the dark water, illuminating a small, eight-passenger recreational motorboat.

*Did they come through with us?* [Wen Desi][y002] thought, his heart pounding. *Or did we not transmigrate at all?* He saw the same question reflected in the grim faces of his fellow committee members.

Meng De desperately scanned the horizon. The moon was gone. The sea was a black, empty void. He fumbled with the ship's equipment.

"No GPS signal!" he shouted.

A flurry of activity as others checked their phones. "Searching for signal." The radios were filled with static.

"We succeeded!" A wave of triumphant cheers erupted from the sterncastle.

In the 17th century, a single motorboat was no threat.

Wu De's voice came over the radio: "We have control of the boat. Four captives. They seem to be tourists."

"Bring them to the flagship."

The committee decided to anchor for the night. The military group, now armed with the weapons from the North American yacht, stood guard.

When [Xiao Zishan][y001] opened the door to the cabin where the captives were being held, he was met with a full-throated roar.

"What the hell are you doing! Pirates! Hooligans!"

"Dad, don't shout," a younger male voice pleaded.

"This is the Qiongzhou Strait, not Somalia! The People's Navy is not to be trifled with!"

"Sirs," a middle-aged woman's voice, calm and measured, cut through the tirade. "We can talk this out. We are just an ordinary family on vacation."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] straightened his collar and stepped into the cabin. The four captives were a family: an elderly couple, their son, and their daughter-in-law. The old man, a retired naval officer, had borrowed a motorboat from an old military acquaintance to relive his sailing days. They had been caught in a strange, sudden storm, and when it subsided, they had found themselves in a dark, unfamiliar sea. They had approached the yacht for help, only to be captured.

"Please, rest for a while," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a polite smile. *How do I explain this?* he thought. *They'll think I've escaped from a mental asylum.*

"Will you let us go ashore at dawn?" the son asked.

"Sir, we are ordinary people," the old woman said, her voice soft but firm. "What use are we to you? My husband was in the navy. My daughter-in-law is a police officer. The ships of the navy, the coast guard, the customs... they are constantly patrolling this strait. Is it worth the risk? We are not heroes. Let us go, and we will say nothing."

"We will discuss everything tomorrow," [Xiao Zishan][y001] replied, his smile unwavering. He stood to leave. "You will see," he said, his voice low and full of a strange, unsettling confidence, "that this is a new world."
