"Look, another country bumpkin is staring blankly..."

A sentence drifted into his ear. Lin Ming originally paid no attention, until he realized that several people were looking at him and realized they were talking about him. He turned his head and saw three or four children licking lollipops, pointing at him and laughing. His face couldn't help but turn red. Although he lived in Foshan, Foshan was one of the "four great towns under heaven," comparable to a major provincial capital, and its prosperity was comparable to Guangzhou. He himself was a "man of letters" who was proficient in poetry, calligraphy, wine, and chess. Not to mention in Foshan, even in the entire Guangzhou prefecture, he was considered a well-known "fashionable figure." Now he was being regarded as a "country bumpkin" by a few children.

Seeing that Lin Ming had noticed them, the children scattered at once. Lin Ming realized he had lost his composure just now. He quickly coughed and continued to walk forward slowly.

The prosperity of the East Gate Market was not beyond his expectations. After all, there were many bustling streets like this in Foshan. However, the good order, clean streets, and the "exotic" style of the houses left a deeper impression on him.

Lin Ming looked left and right, and finally stopped in front of a shop with a sign that read "For the People Employment Agency."

He had long since found out that the so-called employment agency was the 髡贼's version of a "job referral shop." The 髡贼 were roughly all-pervasive, handling everything, even the job referral shops were run by the government.

"Needless to say, the 髡贼 must have a great number of redundant officials and clerks," Lin Ming thought to himself. "Just like the Song Dynasty."

Although Lin Ming was a hereditary military officer, he had at least read some books. He was quite concerned about the fact that the 髡贼 claimed to be descendants of the Song Dynasty. Although he felt that the 髡贼 were just latching on, he couldn't help but make comparisons.

There were not many customers in the shop. They were standing or squatting in twos and threes, some chatting, some eating, and some simply leaning against the wall and dozing. Some even had their luggage with them. Behind a row of wooden counters sat many registration clerks, all wearing the same 髡贼 uniform. Above each person's head hung a wooden plaque with words written on it: "Job Seeker Registration," "Employer Registration," "Certificate Issuance"... Lin Ming couldn't understand what they were and just kept looking around. He saw a huge black wooden board embedded in the wall, with many items written on it in white chalk. A closer look revealed that they were all job listings, and a closer look still showed that they were categorized: "Commercial Employment," "Carpenter," "Clerk," "Laborer," "Industrial Training Worker"...

Although the sentences were all in vernacular and used simplified characters, most of the vocabulary was the "new language" promoted by the 髡贼, which was very different from vernacular. Apart from "carpenter" and "laborer," which he could understand, he could only guess the meaning of the others.

He stretched his neck and carefully browsed. The jobs on the blackboard with the highest demand were "general worker," "agricultural worker," and "industrial training worker." Lin Ming roughly knew that these were all physically demanding jobs. If he took one, he probably wouldn't have much energy to look for his sister-in-law and gather intelligence on the 髡贼. He hadn't come to Lingao to farm and work for the 髡贼.

It would be best to find a leisurely job that allowed him to move around. He browsed the blackboard for a long time and finally found a suitable job: a certain shop in the East Gate Market was looking for a "clerk."

A "clerk" was nothing more than copying and writing. Lin Ming was naturally capable of this job. He quickly walked to the nearest counter and said, "Sir..."

The person sitting behind the counter was not old, but he was very pompous. Although he had shaved his head and changed his clothes, he still exuded the poor and sour air of a down-and-out scholar. He coughed and said in a drawn-out tone, "Don't call me sir, call me comrade. What's the matter?"

"Yes, comrade..." Lin Ming thought, what kind of address is this? It's not written in the *Zizhi Tongjian* or the *History of the Song Dynasty*. "I want to do that job." He couldn't read the Arabic numerals on it, so he had to point with his finger.

The other person didn't even look at his pointing finger and asked without raising his head, "Do you have an employment certificate?"

"Employment certificate?"

"If you don't have one, go to window one to apply for an employment certificate first. Next!" The fake 髡 said this crisply and then stopped talking to him. Lin Ming quickly ran to the counter with the sign "Window One" and "Employment Registration." Here was a middle-aged female 髡, who was quite pleasant:

"Take out your ID card. Can you read? Then fill out a form yourself first to register."

Under the guidance of the female fake 髡, Lin Ming registered his ID card, signed one document after another, and finally received an "employment certificate" and an employment contract. He couldn't help but smile wryly. You really need a certificate for everything here...

"Since you can read, you'd better take the Class C diploma exam. Otherwise, your literacy level will only be 'literate,' and without a literacy level certification, your employment will be greatly restricted." The female fake 髡 was quite enthusiastic and introduced him to the exam. Due to the sharp increase in the number of immigrants, the Class C diploma exam had been increased from once every three months to once a month.

Lin Ming was evasive. Although he didn't know what a Class C diploma was, he knew from the conversation that it was an exam organized by the 髡贼. Those who passed would be given a "diploma," which was not much different from a "degree." If he participated in the "fake exam," it would be a huge "stain" on his record. If someone found out, he would lose his hereditary position as a centurion.

The employment agency was just an "introduction," so whether Lin Ming would be hired as a "clerk" was up to the shopkeeper of the "Haixing Firm" that was recruiting. The employment agency just told him to go to the shop for an "interview."

"You said you can write and do arithmetic, so it should be no problem. If you get the job, have the shopkeeper stamp this, and bring it back to register. If it doesn't work out, come back here to register, and our agency will find a job for you. Understand?" the fake 髡 instructed.

"Yes, I understand. Thank you for the reminder, comrade."

The matter of the job was settled. Lin Ming then asked the counter agent to recommend a long-term rental inn, the "For the People Inn." It was said to be government-run, specifically for new free immigrants to Lingao, and was located in the narrow alley behind the employment agency. It was almost a stone's throw from the back door of the employment agency.

Following the instructions of the fake 髡 at the employment agency, Lin Ming walked half an alley and saw a three-story red brick building. The exterior was not very beautiful, like a square box. There were many windows on the walls, and they were all fitted with glass. This "luxury" was already aesthetically fatiguing for Lin Ming. In Lingao, glass was the most common thing.

The door was large and stood on three stone steps. A black plaque with white characters hung above the door, with the four large regular script characters "For the People Inn" on it.

The door was open. As Lin Ming stepped inside, a very complex smell hit him. It was a special smell composed of tobacco, liquor, sweat, and ragged clothes. This kind of smell was often found in low-class inns. However, the smell in the For the People Inn was also mixed with a strongly irritating smell—the smell of disinfectant.

The lobby was brightly lit. Behind the counter sat a female fake 髡 in a blue uniform, with a thick guest book in front of her. Behind her, a large wooden board was covered with keys. On the wall next to it was a banner notice: "No entry without an ID card!" Below this sentence was a woodblock print of a black and white picture: several fake 髡 "public servants" were holding down a shifty-eyed man with a topknot, in the attire of a Ming dynasty commoner. A white light shone on him, and in the white light was a sentence: "Strictly guard against spies."

Seeing this picture, Lin Ming couldn't help but tremble. He quickly composed himself, took out his ID card, and went to the counter to check in.

"Dormitory or single room?" the female fake 髡 asked after registering his ID card.

Lin Ming hesitated. "Can I see them first?"

"Of course. The first and second floors are dormitories, and the third floor has single rooms. The price is higher."

The first and second floors were large dormitory rooms. The rooms were long and narrow, with bunk beds. Each room had ten bunk beds and could accommodate twenty people. There were lockers against the wall, one for each person, which could be used to store luggage, clothes, and other personal belongings.

Although it was a large dormitory room, the windows were large and the ceiling was high, so the ventilation was good. Even though there were many people living there, the smell was still within a tolerable range.

It was daytime, and most people were out working, but there were also a few people on shifts sleeping. Each bunk had an independent cloth curtain, which could be drawn to create a private space.

On the wall was a large character "Quiet," and many pictures were posted. Lin Ming had no intention of looking at them. He took one look and felt that the dormitory was not suitable. It wasn't that he disliked the conditions, but he had to try to rescue someone in Lingao and couldn't have his every move under the eyes of others. It was said that the 髡贼 had many spies, and it was not guaranteed that there were no spies among these guests.

"I'll take a single room..."

"Okay, I'll take you up."

The room on the third floor was very small. A bed took up three-tenths of the floor space. A table, a chair, and a cabinet, all in the simplest style, were the only furniture. The ceiling was also very low; in fact, the third floor was actually a "mezzanine." However, the window was large and bright, and the room was very clean and tidy.

"This is it." Lin Ming looked around and found that it was easy to climb out of the window of this room and get onto the roof of the two-story building next door. If he needed to sneak in and out, it was like a passage. So he decided to rent this room. He agreed to rent it for three days first, and if the "Haixing Firm" did not provide accommodation, he would renew the lease.

"The washroom and toilet are at the end of the corridor. The shower is in the bathroom on the first floor," the female fake 髡 introduced one by one. "Hot water is only available from six to eight in the morning and evening. Cold water is available all day."

"Thank you, comrade."

"You're welcome," the female fake 髡 was quite generous. "Your attire is inconvenient for living and working here. I suggest you get a haircut and change your clothes."

"This..."

"It's alright. If you want to eat, turn left when you go out, and there's a public canteen in the second alley. If you want to eat at a stall or a small restaurant, it's easy to find them there."
