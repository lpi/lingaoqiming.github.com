"It should be true. A lot of books on sugar production say so." Wen Tong was also quite nervous. Not just him, but even his elders who had been in the sugar industry their whole lives had only worked in modern factories and had never seen this traditional method.

However, the effect that followed was truly like magic. After pouring the yellow mud water and waiting for a moment, the sugar in the funnel had indeed turned snow-white. Of course, this "snow-white" was relative; compared to the refined white sugar of his own time, its color was still slightly dull and yellowish. It didn't quite reach the "exceptionally white" level described in the books.

The sugar at the top of the funnel was the whitest, while the sugar at the bottom had a slight yellowish-brown tinge. Both could be considered white sugar, but the former fetched a higher price.

Wen Tong shook his head. He knew exactly why the sugar washed with yellow mud water wasn't perfectly white: the sugar solution hadn't been processed in a centrifuge, so there was still a lot of molasses residue. He wondered if the machinery factory could build a centrifuge for him.

The production efficiency of this process was also low. The sugar in the funnel was actually layered, with the whitest at the top and the color getting darker towards the bottom. The sugar at the very bottom was quite dark. He weighed it and found that out of ten kilograms of sugar produced in one funnel, only about sixty percent could be considered "white sugar." The rest was yellow or brown sugar. The process was cumbersome, and the yield was low. It was only in ancient times that such a process could be profitable. Once modernized sugar enterprises appeared, the traditional mills went bankrupt one after another due to their high costs.

The sugar produced this way was still in large, loose clumps. To make the fine, powdered "frosting sugar," another "recrystallization" process was needed. The white sugar was melted again and then slowly cooked over a low fire. The fine sugar powder would crystallize on the surface of the pot, layer by layer. It had to be scraped off promptly with a bamboo scraper to prevent it from being scorched and discolored. This process was similar to boiling salt. In a factory, it was done in a special evaporation-crystallization tank. Wen Tong had to experiment with it himself. Chang Shide helped with the fire, and Wen Xiu and Wen Qing assisted. To avoid disrupting the normal production of the mill, Wen Tong had a small, separate sugar mill built on the plantation to serve as a sugar laboratory. The four of them squeezed into this temporary structure, surrounded by smoke and fire. Wen Tong, watching the fire and the pot, became dizzy and nearly fell into the sugar pot, which would have been a tragedy.

It turned out that a person with high-level theory might not be adept at practical operations, especially in such a primitive and crude environment. The stove, fueled by sugarcane leaves and bagasse, was impossible to control for someone used to adjusting gas stoves with a simple knob. After one addition of fuel, the flames roared, and the sugar on the surface of the pot immediately scorched and changed color.

"This is not working. This stove has no temperature control. The heat is too difficult to adjust," Wen Tong said in frustration. The stoker in the traditional mill earned a salary second only to the sugar master, and it was clear he wasn't being paid for nothing.

To regulate the heat evenly, they couldn't use such a wood-fired stove. They needed a stable and evenly-heating fuel source. Various gases, charcoal, or coal briquettes could achieve this effect, or they could use steam for heating, as in a factory, but none of these were available in Xuwen.

Wen Tong racked his brains for a long time and finally came up with the idea of a water bath. By heating the container holding the sugar solution through water, the heating temperature would become uniform, eliminating the problem of scorching and discoloration. After several days of experimentation, he finally harvested the first batch of 5 kilograms of fine white sugar.

With white sugar, making rock candy was a piece of cake. The traditional method for making rock candy involved melting white sugar and adding chicken or duck egg whites for clarification. Wen Tong thought this was too expensive. The so-called egg whites were just protein. He decided to use soy milk as a substitute. He had a mill built on the plantation and had someone who knew how to make tofu among the immigrants make it every day. This not only met the needs of the workers on the plantation but also provided a ready supply of soy milk.

After clarification with soy milk, newly harvested bamboo was split into pieces of different sizes and placed in the sugar solution. The sugar would then crystallize around the bamboo pieces, slowly forming large chunks of rock candy. To harvest it, they just had to break the rock candy and remove the bamboo pieces. This method had existed since the Song Dynasty.

"It looks pretty good—" Although this rock candy couldn't compare to the single-crystal rock candy of later generations, its purity was quite good. It should be a hot commodity on the market.

The next step was to scale up the production of white sugar. Wen Tong ordered pots and utensils for the water bath and hired craftsmen to build a new sugar workshop by the river, specifically for making white sugar. To ensure the cleanliness of the white sugar and improve its quality, he implemented high standards during the construction of the workshop.

The white sugar workshop was built in the style of a modern factory. Although it used wooden beams and columns, the entire building was made of brick and tile, with no thatch or sugarcane leaves for the roof. The windows were large to let in light—to avoid causing too much of a stir, the windows were covered with paper instead of the planned glass. The floor was paved with square bricks and had drainage ditches covered with grates for easy washing. The fifteen cooking stoves were arranged in a single row to save space and facilitate operation. The fire and ventilation openings were located under a covered corridor outside the building, which allowed for operation on rainy days and prevented air and floor contamination inside.

All the equipment was newly made. Wen Tong also had several wells dug by the river, so they wouldn't have to use the more polluted river water directly. He also spent a large sum of money to build a warehouse, also of full brick and tile construction, specifically for storing sugar products. In addition to white and brown sugar, there was also a lot of molasses. Liao Dahua had ordered many large jars from the local pottery workshop to store it—he had no idea what Manager Wen planned to do with it.

The workers in the new sugar factory were all selected from among the immigrants. Wen Tong personally trained them in the various operating procedures and also established a complete set of production rules and regulations.

"Wen Qing!" Wen Tong said, "From now on, you will be in charge of the entire management of the South China Sugar Factory!"

In fact, both Wen Tong and Chang Shide were worried about entrusting such a task to a servant boy, but they had no choice. Apart from the two servant boys, there were very few literate people among the immigrants.

"Yes, thank you for your patronage, Master!" Wen Qing bowed deeply. "I will do my utmost!"

"I have a complete set of production rules and procedures here. You must supervise them to ensure they follow the system completely. No private modifications are allowed. If the workers have any ideas, you can report them to me, and I will naturally consider them."

"Yes, Master!"

"Even if I walk into the workshop and see a single grain of sugar on the floor, I will hold you responsible!" Wen Tong put on his master's airs.

Wen Qing looked at him uneasily. Why had this usually amiable master of the same clan suddenly become so strict?

"Yes, I understand. I will not dare to break a single rule."

"Go. Take your workers to study the regulations. I want them all to have it memorized within three days. Those who can't will not get meat on the weekend."

"Then they will memorize it even if it kills them," Wen Qing said with a smile.

"Hmph," a smile finally appeared on Wen Tong's face. Of the two servant boys, he preferred Wen Qing. Although he was not as good at anticipating the master's needs, he seemed more reliable. "You must also study hard yourself. Do you read the book I gave you every day?"

The book Wen Tong had given him was the "Training Manual for Native Industrial and Commercial Management Cadres," jointly compiled by Wu De's Civil Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Information Committee. It was based on the experience accumulated over several months, combined with ancient and modern industrial and commercial management systems. It introduced basic management models, how to calculate workload, wage calculation methods, welfare standards, and guidance on handling accidents and emergencies. This book, like the "Civil Affairs Management and Organization Manual," was part of the "Native Work Series," which was still in the "Request for Comments" stage.

"I study it hard every night. There are some things I don't understand, and I would like to ask for your guidance, Master."

"If there's anything you don't understand, you can come and ask me at any time in the evening," Wen Tong said earnestly. "You come from a servant background. Although you know a few characters, how can those workers be easily convinced by you? You must have skills to have prestige, not just rely on your master's power to suppress them."

"Yes! I thank you for your teachings, Master."

After sending Wen Qing away, Wen秀 brought a tea tray over.

"You've worked hard, Master. Please have some tea." Since learning that the two managers were not interested in "male companionship," the more honest-looking Wen Qing had recently been favored. Knowing that he had to change his ways, he had hidden the coquettishness that used to show from time to time and appeared much more demure.

"Hmm, where is Master Chang?"

"He went to Haian Street."

Haian Street was the export port for Leizhou's sugar. Although it was not a county town, it was much more prosperous than the county seat of Haikang. There were more than thirty sugar merchants on the street alone. The first time Wen Tong went there, he was truly shocked by its grandeur. After seeing enough of the dilapidated and impoverished scenes in Lingao, the impact of arriving in such a bustling commercial center of the Ming Dynasty was no less than that of a Lingao villager visiting the East Gate Market.

If the small Haian Street was so lively and prosperous, he couldn't imagine the level of prosperity in major commercial cities like Suzhou, Yangzhou, or Guangzhou.

Wen Tong was a little surprised. Although Haian Street was only ten kilometers away, they always informed each other before going on a long trip. Sneaking out like this, could he have gone to find a woman? Wen Tong immediately thought of it: Haian Street, with its bustling trade and prosperous market, had always been a good place for brothels to do business.

"He really went to find some wild food!" Wen Tong gritted his teeth. *Old Chang, you're not a true brother. If you're going for something so good, you should have told me. We could have gone to have fun together.* Now that he had gone with Liao Dahua, he didn't dare to go out casually by himself. He had to suppress his anger and go to the worker training class to teach them three hundred basic simplified characters, simple mathematics, and statistics. In the future, when the sugar factory expanded, these workers could be promoted to management positions.

While Wen Tong was gritting his teeth in frustration at being abandoned and berating a particularly clumsy worker-student, Chang Shide was strolling down Haian Street, accompanied by Liao Dahua. Their destination: the human market.

Chang Shide had originally wanted to go directly to a brothel to take care of his needs. He was prepared for the threat of venereal diseases—he had stuffed several boxes of Durex in his luggage. But after being introduced to a few so-called high-class brothels by Liao Dahua and inquiring about the prices, he was not pleased. The facilities in these brothels were good, and the women were passable even by modern standards, but there were too many pretentious procedures. There was the tea ceremony, listening to music and drinking, and even after all that, they couldn't get down to business right away. They had to come back two or three times before they could even get near the bed. It was too much trouble. Even the "high-class clubs" of his own time didn't have such complicated procedures.

Chang Shide didn't know that high-class brothels in this era also served as social venues. Officials, wealthy merchants, and powerful guests came here mainly for socializing and to satisfy their cultural needs. The higher the class of the prostitute, the more she would sit and discuss philosophy with you, rather than getting into bed and showing off her skills.

Seeing that Master Chang was not interested, Liao Dahua guessed his thoughts. These sea merchants, having been at sea for a long time, naturally couldn't wait for all this fuss. So he led him to the back alleys, where there were more practical "private establishments."

However, after observing the makeup of the women soliciting customers at the door and the smell wafting from afar, Chang Shide once again felt that if he wanted a woman in this world, it was best to raise one himself. Although Liao Dahua specially recommended several places where the women were said to be particularly understanding of a man's needs, Chang Shide still refused, saying it was better to keep a few himself.

Liao Dahua knew that none of these women caught his eye. Thinking that the Australians seemed to have a thing for cleanliness and probably found the prostitutes dirty, he heard that he wanted to keep his own and led him to the human market.

The so-called human market was just an open space. A few human traffickers sat in a nearby thatched shed, drinking tea and chatting. These were the ones selling the higher-quality goods. If someone was interested, they would lead the customer to a nearby house to see the person—mostly young women, but also boys who could be used as catamites, naturally at a high price. There were also some who were literally selling themselves with a straw stuck in their hair, for a low price.

Chang Shide walked around, looking at the goods of the traffickers and those selling themselves, but he didn't find anyone to his liking. The traffickers' goods were naturally clean and well-dressed, and their looks were passable, but the price was a bit too high. A girl of eleven or twelve cost fifty taels. Chang Shide didn't want to raise a loli, nor was he interested in lolis themselves. Besides, he didn't have that much silver—he had accumulated tens of thousands of coupons, though.

Seeing Master Chang's displeased face, Liao Dahua knew that he didn't like any of them. He couldn't figure out his thoughts, so he just continued to follow him.

After another round, he suddenly saw a new stall. A few yamen runners were standing there, and on the ground, five or six women of different ages were kneeling or sitting. The oldest was in her thirties, the youngest only twelve or thirteen. Although they were disheveled and their skin was dark, they looked to be in good nutritional condition. Strangely, no one was going over to ask. He had Liao Dahua go over and inquire.
