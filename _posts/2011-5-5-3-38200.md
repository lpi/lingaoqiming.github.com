Xuan Chun wasn't what you'd call beautiful, but her figure was full and curvaceous, which was more to the modern man's taste. Liu San couldn't help but feel his mind start to wander, and he struck up a conversation.

"How did your master's family end up here?" In the eyes of the people of this time, Hainan Island was a typically poor, remote, and miasma-ridden place. Ordinary people wouldn't come here unless they had no other choice or were exiled for a crime.

"The master's family couldn't make a living anymore, so they had no choice but to come here to seek refuge with relatives," Xuan Chun said very crisply. "My master was originally a Juren, but he was unfortunately framed by an enemy over an antique and died. The family was instantly ruined and couldn't stay in Zhangzhou. Our mistress and the mistress here are cousins, so we had to come seek refuge."

"I see." Liu San nodded. He thought to himself, *New people have entered this household. I wonder if the General Political Security Bureau has secretly investigated their background?* Runshitang was now a key cooperative partner. "Was the journey difficult?"

"Traveling is never as convenient as being at home." Xuan Chun seemed unwilling to say more about the journey. After making the bed, she said, "It's done," and hopped off the bed. "Third Master, please wait a moment." She soon returned with a copper basin full of hot water.

"Let me wipe your body and change your clothes, Third Master."

"No need, no need," Liu San refused subconsciously.

"Third Master's clothes are soaked through. It's easy to catch a cold if they stick to your body." Xuan Chun's words were crisp and carried a kind of decisiveness that was hard to refuse. "Let me wipe you down and change you into something dry. You'll sleep more comfortably."

Now that she mentioned it, the damp collar and sweaty undershirt sticking to his body did feel uncomfortable. But he hadn't planned on staying here long and hadn't brought a change of clothes.

"The Master has already prepared them for you," Xuan Chun said, holding up a set of cotton-silk underclothes. "The Young Mistress made these for you herself, Third Master."

Liu San couldn't help but be moved by such warmth. His sworn brother's family was truly treating him well! Although there was undoubtedly an element of currying favor, this level of care and consideration was something he couldn't get elsewhere.

Xuan Chun was about to unbutton his shirt, but Liu San stopped her. "I'll do it myself."

"Let me serve you. You need to change quickly so you don't catch a cold." Without another word, she began to unbutton his shirt, one by one. He could see she was very curious about the clothes, especially the white, translucent plastic buttons.

"The Third Mistress must be very virtuous and capable," Xuan Chun asked as she set the shirt aside and wrung out a towel.

The towel was new, and the slightly hot water felt incredibly comfortable and pleasant on his skin.

"How can you tell?" Liu San asked, puzzled.

"The cut of this garment is so neat, and the stitches are so dense and even. I've never seen such fine needlework."

Liu San laughed—Wuyunhua couldn't even sew a button, let alone make clothes.

"This was made in a factory, sewn by a machine!"

"I've never heard of that. Using machines to make clothes?" Xuan Chun apparently had some concept of what a machine was.

"Of course, we have them."

Xuan Chun wiped his chest and back, even under his arms. She treated him like a patient, which made Liu San quite embarrassed. Xuan Chun's movements were deft and quick, wiping his body and wringing the towel in one smooth motion. She then immediately shook out an undershirt and helped him put it on.

The shirt fit perfectly. The thin, soft, and smooth fabric felt indescribably comfortable against his skin.

Xuan Chun then brought a new wooden basin to wash his feet. Liu San no longer refused and fully enjoyed the service. Xuan Chun's fingers were strong, and she occasionally massaged the acupoints and meridians on his feet.

"You know how to massage?"

"I learned some guidance and massage techniques when I served my old master," Xuan Chun said. "Does the Third Master find it comfortable?"

"Very good." Liu San let out a satisfied sigh. Being served, especially by a reasonably attractive woman, was truly wonderful.

"As for the trousers, please change them on the bed yourself, Third Master," Xuan Chun said with a slight smile, covering her mouth.

After changing his clothes, Liu San felt comfortable all over. He sat on the bed and watched Xuan Chun tidy up his discarded clothes, the basin, and other things. Her full figure and nimble movements were a pleasant sight.

A moment later, Xuan Chun came in again and asked if there was anything else he needed. If he wanted a midnight snack, there was porridge warming on the "five-geng chicken" stove outside, ready at any time.

After all this activity, Liu San was no longer sleepy. Seeing that Xuan Chun had finished tidying up but didn't go to sleep, instead waiting by the side, he asked, "Why don't you go to sleep?"

"I am on night duty for the Third Master. How could I go to sleep myself? That's not proper," Xuan Chun said. "If the Master has no other orders, I will go lie down in the outer room for a while."

"If you're not sleepy, stay and talk with me for a while." Liu San had already taken an interest in this maid.

Xuan Chun hesitated. She had been sent to serve Liu San, and the Young Master's intentions were self-evident: to satisfy all of this Third Master's needs. Although Yang Shixiang wasn't strictly her master, her own mistress and young ladies were now dependents living under his roof, let alone a maid like herself.

Besides, although she still wore a maid's hairstyle, she was long past being a virgin. She had only maintained the appearance of a maiden because her relationship with her old master had never been made official. To serve this "Australian Master" for the night was nothing—just her own bitter fate. At this thought, her eyes couldn't help but sting a little. She brightened the candle flame, poured more hot tea, and sat down aggrievedly on the edge of the bed.

Liu San saw Xuan Chun's eyes were slightly red, as if she felt wronged. He wondered if she had been forced to serve him. For a moment, he didn't know what to say and could only make small talk.

"How old are you, miss?"

"I am twenty-five," Xuan Chun replied. She was actually twenty-eight, but she had hidden three years.

"You don't look it!" This was a common compliment for women, timeless in its use.

Xuan Chun indeed showed a hint of a smile. "Master, please don't make fun of us servants."

"I really can't tell." Liu San thought, *The ancients always think women over twenty are old hags and only fourteen or fifteen-year-old girls are good. Are they all lolicon?* He had no interest in skinny shoulders and flat chests. How could they compare to the graceful charm of the woman before him, like a ripe peach?

However, he had no words to woo her. Liu San knew nothing about what the women of this era liked or thought. All his pickup artist techniques were useless. He could only try to find some topics to ask about.

"Are you used to living in Lin'gao?"

"It's fine!" Xuan Chun smiled slightly. "The Young Master and Young Mistress are very kind and take good care of us." She continued, "My mistress originally thought Lin'gao was a barbaric place, heavy with miasma, and was afraid she couldn't stay. I didn't expect it to be so good here!"

"Hehe," Liu San felt a little proud. He had a hand in this. "But it can't compare to Zhangzhou, can it?"

"It's different! As soon as we landed, my mistress said: this is a scene of peace and prosperity. Just living here feels reassuring."

"How many people are in your family?"

"The mistress, three young misses, and the young master. There was also a concubine who died of sunstroke on the way." Xuan Chun's eyes reddened again, likely thinking of the hardships of the journey. "When we set out, we had the old steward and several servants and maids. Along the way, some left, some died. By the time we reached Lin'gao, only three or four of us were left. The family is completely broken."

"I meant your own family."

"Me?" Xuan Chun was taken aback. "I have a father, mother, an older sister, an older brother, and a younger sister at home. But I haven't been home in ten years. I don't know how they are."

"Since your master's family has broken up, why don't you go back? Is your mistress unwilling to let you go?"

"She is willing to let us go. She let go of anyone who wanted to return. It's me who doesn't want to go back."

"It's always good to go home," Liu San said.

"Go back to do what?" Xuan Chun smiled bitterly. "To get married?"

She was no longer a virgin, had passed the marriageable age, and her master's family had fallen on hard times and couldn't provide a generous dowry. Who would want her, except for some poor man who couldn't afford a wife? And she certainly wasn't willing to marry someone like that.

"Why not get married? Is there no one who would marry you?"

Xuan Chun's face showed a hint of displeasure—was he deliberately mocking her or what? After a long pause, she said, "An old pearl is not worth much. People look down on me."

"How are you an old pearl? I think you are in your prime."

Flattery will get you everywhere. Xuan Chun's face finally broke into a smile. "Master is making fun of us servants again."

"Not kidding at all," Liu San said. "My wife is the same age as you, and she still thinks she's a young girl all day long."

Xuan Chun smiled. She was no longer sleepy, and it was a good way to pass the time to talk with this Third Master. But she couldn't comment on the master's wife, so she just said:

"The Third Master's wife must be very capable in worldly affairs," Xuan Chun asked. She had only been in Lin'gao for a short time, but she knew that women among the Australians held high status. Some were officials, some were merchants, each a formidable figure in her own right.

"More than capable, she's a very formidable woman," Liu San said. "But it's thanks to her that I was able to meet you."

Xuan Chun didn't understand his meaning and didn't feel it was appropriate to ask. But Liu San was easy to talk to and hadn't made any improper advances. Her impression of him had improved greatly, and she no longer felt as reluctant as before. "Master, are you an Australian?"

"Yes."

"Everyone says Australia is a rich and prosperous country—why did you come to a barren place like Lin'gao? And you've stayed here for so long."

"It's a long story." Liu San sighed deeply. Why did he come here? He himself was a little fuzzy on the details. It seemed it was for a fresh start.

Xuan Chun, however, thought there was some other unspeakable reason, that he too had come to Lin'gao "out of necessity." She felt a sense of camaraderie with him, and for a moment, didn't know what to say. In this silent moment, there was a "pop," and looking up, she saw a spark from the candlewick burst. From far away came the sound of a steam whistle, one long and one short, a total of twelve times.

"It's getting late!" Xuan Chun asked softly, "Is the Master tired?"

"You must be tired too!" Liu San took the opportunity to take her hand. Xuan Chun's hand was a bit rough and not delicate, but it was very soft.

Holding a woman's hand was nothing in the modern era, but in this time, it carried the meaning of flirtation. Xuan Chun's face flushed crimson, but she didn't dare to snatch her hand away.

"Your hand is very soft."

"A maid's hand, how good can it be?" Xuan Chun said in a low voice. "Master, please let go—"

But Liu San didn't let go. He squeezed her arm. Through the thin padded jacket, her arm muscles were firm, and it felt good to squeeze.

Xuan Chun was greatly embarrassed and just lowered her head without speaking—she had already developed some good feelings for this "Third Master."

"Your hand is very cold," Liu San said suddenly. It was now the third watch of the night. The night was deep and the dew was cold. Xuan Chun was thinly dressed, and his words made her feel even colder.

Liu San took the opportunity to pull her into an embrace. In an instant, she was in his arms. Xuan Chun struggled slightly, but he kissed her deeply on the neck, and her whole body went limp.

"Master—" she called out in a low voice.

The candle flame was instantly extinguished.

The next morning, when Liu San woke up, the room was already filled with sunlight. He quickly felt for his gun—it was still there. He looked at his watch; it was almost ten o'clock. Xuan Chun was no longer by his side, only a few long strands of hair were left on the pillow. Liu San felt a sense of bewilderment, and at the same time, a pang of guilt towards his girlfriend. As he was savoring the moment, the door creaked open, and Xuan Chun came in with a basin of water to help him wash up.

"The clothes the Third Master changed out of last night have all been washed and are drying. They should be dry by this evening," Xuan Chun said. "How many nights is the Third Master planning to stay here? So I can inform the kitchen to prepare."

"I have to go back today," Liu San said. He still had many things to do. Hiding out in a native's house for no reason was unjustifiable.

Xuan Chun showed no sign of lingering affection or private sentiment. *Is this the ancient version of a "one-night stand"?* Liu San was a little disappointed. Just then, Yang Shixiang came in, and Xuan Chun quickly withdrew.

Yang Shixiang wore a pleased smile and gave him a meaningful bow. "Did you sleep well last night?"

Liu San's face turned red. He was now even more certain that this was his sworn brother's arrangement.

"I slept very well. I had a spring dream!"

Yang Shixiang was in high spirits, feeling that he had further deepened their bond. "Is Xuan Chun to your liking, worthy brother?"

Liu San nodded. Xuan Chun had been pliant and submissive in bed, a demure and yielding figure, which had fully satisfied his masculine pride.

"If your wife hadn't forbidden you from taking a concubine, I would have prepared a dowry and personally escorted her to your residence," Yang Shixiang said. "As it is, I won't cause you this trouble."

Liu San was already feeling uneasy about this fleeting affair. Hearing him mention Wuyunhua made him even more anxious.

"Worthy brother need not worry. I will treat her well. When you come again in the future, I will have her serve you," Yang Shixiang said.

Liu San couldn't refuse. Yang Shixiang had considered everything for him. He could only say, "Thank you for your trouble, big brother!"

"Not at all. We are brothers. Why be so formal?"

Leaving Runshitang, Liu San felt very uneasy—he was grateful for Yang Shixiang's kindness, but he was also afraid that he had taken on a burden. Having an affair in Runshitang was safe, but frequent visits would naturally lead to rumors. What would happen when Wuyunhua found out? He was greatly troubled by this matter.

"Forget it. I'll cross that bridge when I come to it," Liu San comforted himself. He remembered he had a meeting about the Chinese medicine factory at the Ministry of Health in the afternoon and hurried towards his office.
