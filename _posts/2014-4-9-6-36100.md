"Actually, you are not at a disadvantage. Please think about it, if there is no reliable and capable person, how can managing land be an easy matter?" Li Xiaopeng said. "As for the expenses, they are all spent on your own land. In the future, if you don't want the land anymore, the price you sell it for will not be the price of the barren and poor land you buy now—so you are not at a disadvantage."

"Then what about the partial package?"

Li Xiaopeng said that the partial package meant that all the expenses required for farming were invested by the landlord. Whether to improve the soil and water, and build water conservancy projects were all at the landlord's discretion. The landlord was also responsible for paying taxes. The Tiandihui was only responsible for production and management, collecting a corresponding service fee, and did not participate in the profit sharing.

If the landlord himself had a large amount of capital to invest independently, the partial package was obviously more cost-effective. If the financial resources were insufficient and the investment was limited, then even with the Tiandihui's help, the production level would not rise quickly.

In addition to the partial package, there were also individual services, with a service fee paid for each use. Pest control, mechanized irrigation, mechanized plowing and harvesting... any need in agricultural production could be purchased as a single service.

Some people were still not reconciled and kept asking if they could buy land to build their own houses, and whether it was difficult to recruit tenants. Li Xiaopeng explained the relevant policies again: the Australian law did not prohibit this, but it was very difficult to do.

However, when he said this, many people were still skeptical. Li Xiaopeng did not swear an oath, but said that if they were willing, they could try it themselves:

"Our Li family is in business, and as the saying goes, even if a deal falls through, goodwill remains. If you have other ideas, you can give it a try. If there is anything you don't understand, as long as we know, we will tell you everything we know."

Next, Li Xiaopeng answered many more questions from the wealthy families, covering all aspects of buying a house, acquiring property, and living in Lingao. It was a testament to Li Xiaopeng's vast knowledge and strong memory that he was able to answer almost every question, and he did so in a very straightforward and capable manner, displaying the style of a shrewd and competent businessman.

Zhuo Yifan was not here to buy land and property, but this was the first time he had attended such a briefing. He was somewhat curious and wanted to see what clever tricks the 髡 had up their sleeves to be able to both entice the poor and persuade the rich to come to Lingao.

However, after listening to so much, he only felt that the rich masters must have lost their minds to come to Lingao—a place with such harsh laws and constant risk of offense, no different from the tyrannical Qin dynasty. Even building a house had all sorts of trivial rules! Not to mention the various "taxes." He had heard that the 髡 were "extravagant," but he had not expected them to be so ruthless in their exploitation of the people! They were so unscrupulous even with the gentry. Their cruelty towards the common people must be even more extreme—but this was completely different from what he had seen along the way.

Zhuo Yifan was puzzled. Seeing that the briefing was over, he followed the crowd out of the flower hall and returned to the courtyard.

That evening, Li Xiaoliu personally delivered several large, thick books. He said, "Please, masters and mistresses, take your time to look through them. If you like any, make a list, and we can arrange for a viewing starting tomorrow."

The books were bound in the Australian style, with covers made of fine sheepskin. They were heavy in the hand, about twice the size of a normal book.

Opening them, he found exquisite, thick paper inside. On it were drawings of various houses, gardens, and courtyards. Each drawing was accompanied by a floor plan, with small notes and explanations.

This was not in itself rare. Ancient Chinese builders also had floor plans and renderings—they were not needed for building houses for common people, but they were essential for building for officials, nobles, or the emperor. There were many such drawings in the Qing court archives and the archives of the Lei family of architects.

However, the drawings in these books were not only drawn in a style unlike that of the Chinese, but the beauty of the patterns, the richness of the colors, and the exquisiteness of the details were breathtaking.

Zhuo Yifan was from a family of officials and the first disciple of the White Stone Daoist. He had traveled extensively and seen a great deal, but he had never seen anything so exquisite. He carefully examined a few pages and realized that this was a development by the Li Family Slope Real Estate Company—that is, Li Xiaopeng's family business.

These houses were all built in a place called "Bigui Garden." Zhuo Yifan had never heard of it, but it didn't matter; he had no intention of buying a house.

At a glance, the houses were not much different from those in the Great Ming in terms of layout and style. But as he turned the pages, his eyes lit up.

It turned out that the following pages were all interior renderings, something that was absolutely non-existent in 17th-century China. At that time, interior decoration and furnishings were mostly described in writing in the form of "furnishing accounts." But the renderings of the Australians showed a style that was completely unfamiliar to them.

Large glass windows made the rooms bright; bamboo and wood floors were clean and tidy; ceramic floor and wall tiles with various colors and patterns were both beautiful and shiny; luxurious crystal glass chandeliers cast a soft light... all paired with various beautiful and practical furniture and supplies, which greatly subverted Zhuo Yifan's understanding of "luxury." If they had not already experienced the Zimin Building in Guangzhou, they would have thought these were just fanciful drawings.

Wan Lifeng and the others standing beside him were also engrossed in the pictures. For a moment, the room was silent.

"No wonder the wealthy flock to it like moths to a flame," Wan Lifeng sighed after a long time. "It's too luxurious! Even the emperor probably doesn't have this."

"The emperor is dedicated to governing the country, how can he indulge in pleasure?" Zhuo Yifan deeply agreed. He knew a little about the imperial palace. Although the luxuries in the palace were not comparable to those of ordinary gentry families, compared to the pictures in this brochure, they did seem a bit "rustic."

He picked up another book and flipped through it. The one they had just been looking at was a real estate brochure; this one was a household goods brochure. Although the Li family's company did not produce or sell these "Australian household goods" itself, as an important supporting facility, it had also specially made a brochure to promote them in order to earn greater profits.

Although they were called "Australian household goods," a considerable part of them were actually selected products imported from Southeast Asia, Europe, Persia, India, Japan, and Korea. It was a collection of all kinds of "exotic and ingenious" goods. Even Zhuo Yifan, who had many foreign goods at home, was dazzled. He had never seen many of these things before.

The content of the brochure was too tempting. Gradually, everyone in the room gathered around, clicking their tongues in amazement. They all felt that their horizons had been broadened.

"The 髡 are so extravagant and debauched. The gentry and common people of Hainan must be suffering greatly at their hands!" Zhuo Yifan closed the book and sighed. "We can only do our best to eliminate this great scourge for the court and the people!" With that, he tossed the brochure aside.

The heroes and heroines all expressed their firm support for the court and their determination to fight the 髡 to the end. However, the brochure became a hot topic. They all vied to look at it, pointing and discussing it endlessly, like children who had seen a Toys "R" Us catalog: even if they couldn't have it, it was good to look.

Today, Sima Qiudao, as usual, got off the urban rail train from Bopu, ending a day of running around.

His job today was to go to the coastal area of northern Lingao to inspect samples and check the progress of production: the Native Products Company had signed a purchase contract with the local fishermen. After getting off the train in Bopu, Sima Qiudao had been on his feet all day.

Getting off the train, he was sore and tired, and could barely lift his legs. This 髡's rice was really not easy to eat.

Although Sima Qiudao was still wearing "old-style" clothes, his body already bore the marks of "Australian-style" or "new-style" clothing. He carried a canvas satchel over his shoulder, with the shop's name embroidered on it. The bag was stuffed with notebooks, inkwells, sample books, and blank agreements and contracts. There were two pockets on the left and right of the bag, one for a bamboo water bottle and the other for a lunch box, which was very in line with his identity as a purchasing agent.

He also carried a "Russian-style" toilet bag on his back, which contained samples of local products he had collected from near Bopu.

Sima Qiudao followed the crowd out of the station and bought a copy of the day's "Lingao Times" from a newspaper vendor at the entrance.

He bought a newspaper every day because the "Notes on Pacifying the 髡" had told them that reading the newspaper could provide a lot of important information. It not only contained the movements of the 髡, but also, if something happened to Zhuo Yifan or Huang Zhen, there would be news in the newspaper.

Today's newspaper was still peaceful. Sima Qiudao folded the newspaper and put it in his canvas satchel.

For the past few days, Sima Qiudao had been checking the designated location for a safety signal every day after work, anxiously waiting for news of Zhuo Yifan and his group.

Last night, he had finally seen the long-awaited signal of their safe arrival at the designated location.

This finally put his anxious heart at ease.

In this operation, the various groups acted separately. Although they knew roughly what they were going to do, the specific details would only be conveyed after they had all entered Lingao and settled down. Although Sima Qiudao was only Huang Zhen's deputy, he served as the general liaison.

Therefore, as soon as Huang Zhen and his group settled down in Nanbao, Sima Qiudao immediately left Nanbao for East Gate Market and went into hiding to await new instructions.

So far, he had been receiving new information from Seventh Master—through a prostitute or a post office letter—which not only provided the latest internal information of the 髡, but also provided various conveniences for their activities in Lingao, which played a great role in their safe settlement and hiding in Lingao.

But Sima Qiudao did not know the specific content of the operation.

Although it was said at the time of departure that Zhuo Yifan knew, Sima Qiudao knew that this was a lie: neither Zhuo Yifan nor Huang Zhen knew the specific details of the mission.

From Shi Weng's extreme caution, Sima Qiudao vaguely felt a sense of worry.
