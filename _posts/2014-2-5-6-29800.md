Based on the observed error, Hale made fine adjustments to the elevation and direction angles again. The other cannons were also adjusted accordingly and loaded with live ammunition.

"Mr. Paul, it seems these cannons aren't as accurate as you said," said Zheng Zhifeng, who was also observing with a telescope from the side, somewhat dissatisfied after seeing where the shells landed. In reality, for these cannons to achieve such high accuracy at such a long range was unprecedented in this era. The Hongyi cannons that the Zheng family had spent a fortune to purchase from the English, the Portuguese in Macau, and even some Greek merchants in Manila were astonishingly inferior. It was just that he had already witnessed the power of the Australians' artillery, which made Hale's shooting seem somewhat lackluster.

"This is called calibration firing. In fact, the purpose of calibration is that after the first shot is fired, it's difficult to hit the target on the first try due to various factors like the temperature of the bore, operating technique, firing force, weather conditions, and so on. The purpose of calibration is to correct the firing data of the cannon so that subsequent shells can accurately hit the target." These professional terms, which he had never heard before, coming out of Hale's mouth, truly stunned Zheng Zhifeng. For most Chinese people at the time, firing a cannon simply meant pointing the muzzle in the general direction of the enemy and lighting it with a match cord. So-called gunnery was something few people cared about, and even fewer truly understood.

"To hit the target on the first shot is either the will of God or guidance..." Hale stopped himself, looking at Zheng Zhifeng's blank, slightly eye-rolling expression, and couldn't help but feel he was casting pearls before swine. He continued, "In fact, general experience dictates that two test shots are needed for safety to determine the margin of error, and then it's easy to compensate and correct the firing data based on that margin. If you are familiar with the site environment and the cannon's performance, you can also conduct only one test shot, like now."

Struggling to make sense of the pile of unfamiliar terms, Zheng Zhifeng asked, "You mean, you can definitely hit it now?"

A cold smile appeared on Hale's confident face. "We shall see."

At his command, the six cannons spat out ten-foot-long tongues of fire, launching the shells at a speed invisible to the naked eye towards the target. Three or four seconds later, several flashes of light erupted on the mound in the telescope, followed a few seconds later by several muffled, thunder-like sounds.

"Exploding shells?" Zheng Zhifeng couldn't help but suck in a cold breath. Not only did most of the shells hit, but they were also powerful exploding shells! Could this be the legendary exploding shells used by the Australians? The power was indeed extraordinary, and most precious of all was such precision!

After witnessing the devastating power of the Australians' shelling of their fleet with high-explosive rounds, Zheng Zhifeng held this weapon in high esteem. However, he had not expected to obtain this "great killer weapon" from Hale.

In the late Ming Dynasty, European high-explosive shells had already flowed into China, but limited by the technology of the time, their power was very small and they did not play a major role in land or sea battles, so they were not taken seriously. It was not until the appearance of the high-explosive shells filled with high-density black powder used by the Australians that exploding shells became something to be feared.

"That's right, high-explosive shells or exploding shells," Hale said. "Although their power is limited in land warfare, in a naval battle, once a wooden ship is hit, the effect is far greater than dozens of solid shots."

"Mr. Feng, are you satisfied with the goods this time?" A slight smile appeared on Hale's face, but his voice remained cold.

"Very satisfied. You, Paul, have never broken your word," Zheng Zhifeng said, returning to reality from his shock and imagination.

"Our deal?"

"Not a penny less. I, Zheng, have also said that as long as your goods are good, you will not be short a single cent of your silver." He had two large chests brought over, filled with shining silver. A gleam of light flashed in Hale's eyes. He caressed the silver with his long fingers, feeling its cool texture, then closed the lids and had them carried away. "According to our previous agreement, for the six cannons, large and small, each will be supplied with 20 exploding shells in addition to the corresponding solid shot. I will leave the firing tables and will teach the gunners you sent until they have all learned."

"A pity there are so few."

Zheng Zhifeng calculated what kind of change it would make to the situation if his newly built three-masted great ships were equipped with such cannons. Not to mention facing the ships of the Zheng Cai brothers or Liu Xiang's Fujian and Guangdong junks, even the great carracks of the red-haired barbarians in Macau would be turned to ash! Although the Australians' ships could move without wind, with such cannons of his own, he could at least fight on a relatively equal footing, instead of being a live target on the sea.

After Operation Hunger, Zheng Zhifeng, on one hand, reorganized his remaining ships, using that year's timber to rush-build large Fujian junks to make up for the shortage of trading vessels. On the other hand, he re-established a shipyard on Kinmen Island, sparing no expense to purchase dry materials and begin building new dedicated warships. The models for these warships were the unfinished improved Fujian junks that Xu Ke had discovered at the new shipyard in Zhongzuosuo. These ships were the result of local shipwrights improving on the advantages of European ships.

Hale seemed to know what he was thinking and said with a cold smile, "Pardon my frankness, but if you continue to install these cannons I've given you on those wooden boxes of yours, you will still be no match for the Australians."

Zheng Zhifeng was shaken. Although he wanted to refute Hale's words, the disastrous defeat of the Zheng family's fleet in Weitou Bay left him speechless. It took him a while to say:

"The red-haired barbarians' ships, we have a few of those too, and they are still no match for the Australians..."

"Their ships are at a disadvantage because of their cannons. With my cannons installed, they can at least contend with the Australians for a while. As for those wooden boxes of yours, I advise you not to build any more. It would be more cost-effective to dismantle them for firewood sooner rather than later."

"You mean?"

"Those Chinese ships you build, no matter what they're called, I've observed them carefully. They may be good as trading ships, but they are very unsuitable as warships. They have no decks, and their center of gravity is too high. It's difficult to arrange the cannons. Those ships of yours can only carry three or four cannons, unable to form the power of a broadside."

"To build Western-style ships, I don't have craftsmen who are skilled in Western shipbuilding techniques," Zheng Zhifeng said. "I have enough ship materials and many craftsmen. I can even start building ten ships at the same time without any problem."

"What do you think of the two-masted ships you see in Manila's port?"

"Very good, but don't you think they are a bit too small?"

"When the Australian fleet attacked Zhangzhou Bay, most of them were these light, fast little boats. They are of course too small compared to your wooden boxes. But they are very fast, fast enough to match the Australian patrol boats. And their small bodies can also be fitted with four cannons." Hale made a gesture, and a Tagalog servant brought a glass of red wine. "You should have seen the Australian patrol boats."

"Yes. But they are no match for the Australians' big, fast ships..."

"You don't need to worry about that. As long as you are willing, I will soon build larger warships, sufficient to contend with them. And of course, I will sell them to you," Hale said calmly.

Zheng Zhifeng's eyes lit up. But he quickly realized this was just drawing a cake to satisfy his hunger. Even so, those light, small boats equipped with Hale's cannons could at least play a certain role.

"Then what price do I need to pay?"

Hale laughed. "You truly are a first-rate businessman." He put down his empty wine glass. "Are your Anhai ships still coming to Manila?"

"If I'm not mistaken, your nephew Zheng Sen and the Zheng Cai brothers will also send ships to Manila. After all, this is the largest trading channel you have left."

"And Japan."

"Unless you send a fleet to Japan to eradicate the Australian influence, I don't see what advantage you have in the Japan trade. Let's not talk about that for now. I think you would certainly be willing to monopolize the Manila trade, or at least exclude those annoying relatives."

Zheng Zhifeng's eyes widened. If he could exclude these two competitors from the Manila trade, the Zheng Lian and Zheng Cai brothers and Zheng Sen, having lost their source of income, would soon decline, and dealing with them would be as easy as turning over his hand.

"Your condition is..."

"You must send enough ships to Manila. During the trading season, there should be at least four to five Anhai ships arriving each month, the more the better..."

"How is that possible?" Zheng Zhifeng shook his head, interrupting him. "The Spanish don't have that much silver to buy my goods."

"The Spanish don't, but I have cannons, and perhaps warships in the future."

"You mean," Zheng Zhifeng asked, somewhat surprised and astonished, "I can directly use goods to pay for the value of the ships and cannons?!"

"That's right," Hale said. "Of course, I will decide which specific goods can be used for payment."

"As long as it's not something too obscure."

"You can rest assured, the things I want are all very easy to procure." Hale pulled a piece of paper from his pocket. "This is the specific list of goods."

Zheng Zhifeng took it. The goods listed on the paper were indeed ordinary things. There were over a hundred items in total, some of which Zheng Zhifeng himself did not know what they were. The main ones were pig iron, copper, lead, mercury, and various metals.

"The items are not difficult. But these are all slow-moving goods. You won't get a good price for them after you take them..."

"Hehe, my dear friend. Your perspective is still that of a merchant from beginning to end," Hale laughed. "You don't need to worry about my financial problems. The more goods you provide, the more weapons and ships I can supply you. Of course, you can freely transport and sell silk, porcelain, and miscellaneous goods."

"Good, it's a deal!"

"Finally, I need more people. They can also be considered a type of cargo."

"People?" Zheng Zhifeng hesitated. "Don't you know the Spanish are very wary of Chinese immigrants?"

Throughout the history of their colonization of the Philippines, the Spanish had always held a suspicious yet dependent attitude towards Chinese immigrants. And at this time, it had only been a few decades since the so-called "Chinese Uprising" of the Wanli era.
