After swiping his card at the residential area entrance, he saw people playing PSP in the square and felt a sense of returning to civilization. Others were playing badminton or table tennis. He had no heart to watch and returned to his dormitory. He shared a room with Cui Yunhong and Dong Shiye—the latter occasionally joined the exploration team's missions.

Cui Yunhong had disappeared somewhere after dinner, and Dong Shiye was still at work. The dormitory was empty, leaving him all alone. As material conditions improved, the dorms were now furnished—in the past, everyone slept on the floor. After the redecoration, Bai Guoshi felt like he was back in his old university dorm: a loft bed with a desk underneath, a personal locker, a wardrobe, and a shelf for his cup and washbasin. The most conspicuous item was the gun rack behind the door, where an SKS-D rifle was chained, its magazine full. The only drawback was the lack of internet, and electricity was restricted, available only from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Bai Guoshi went to the bathroom for a shower. The water was cold; hot water was only available in the evening, but he was used to it. The sound of running water from the women's bathroom next door suggested someone else was showering too—unfortunately, the bathroom was artfully designed, with separate entrances for men and women. The women's entrance led directly into Block Six. After his shower, he washed his clothes as well. The men in his dorm had a habit of letting dirty laundry pile up until they had nothing left to wear, making the room always smell like stale, salty fish. Every time Fang Yijing came for a hygiene inspection, she gave them a "poor" rating.

Shuffling back from the bathhouse in his slippers, Bai Guoshi found the room still empty—no one to even chat with. He took out a plastic-sealed bag from his cabinet containing a carton of cigarettes. In his original world, he had never touched tobacco, but now he desperately wanted a puff. He went out and sat under a tree in the square. The first drag made him choke and brought tears to his eyes. He quickly extinguished the cigarette, but the tears, released by the smoke, wouldn't stop. Months of nearly continuous exploration missions had numbed him, but a single cigarette had unleashed everything. His parents, friends, and classmates all seemed to be right before his eyes. *I must be f*cking crazy to come here. I don't even have a girlfriend, I've never even held a woman's hand...*

A tissue was handed to him. He looked up to see Zhao Xue. "I didn't expect you to cry, hmph," she said with a mischievous smile.

"I choked on the smoke," he said, taking the tissue. Zhao Xue's hair was wet, and his heart skipped a beat.

"Who'd believe that? It's not a crime to cry."

"Is your knee better?" Bai Guoshi didn't want to show weakness in front of a woman.

"I just got it treated at the hospital. They applied some medicine, and it doesn't hurt as much." Zhao Xue casually lifted her pant leg and wiggled her knee.

The young woman's fair, firm calf and the glimpse of white skin on her knee were exposed right before the innocent university graduate's eyes. A faint scent, a mixture of camphorated tincture and something like orchids, wafted over. Once again, Xiao Bai felt his ears burning as if they were being boiled in water.

"It's good that you're fine, good."

"Come on, go wash your face. We need to get the report done. You have to present it tonight."

"Right, right." Bai Guoshi hadn't expected her to so openly invite him to work on the documents together, and he was overjoyed. His gloomy mood was instantly thrown to the winds. "I'll go wash up right now. Shall we meet at the office later?"

"No need. I'll wait for you here in the square. It's a long walk, we can talk on the way."

Bai Guoshi was so struck by happiness that he felt dizzy. When he stood up, he swayed a few times before happily heading off.

The debriefing for the 45th Remote Exploration Mission was held on time at 7 p.m. in the Executive Committee compound.

The bigwigs of the Executive Committee sat grimly behind a horseshoe-shaped table, facing a row of chairs in the center. It was said that someone had arranged the furniture based on the model of a U.S. congressional hearing.

Presenting the report were Liu Zheng, Cui Yunhong, Huang Zhaizi, and Bai Guoshi. Zhao Xue and Ye Mengyan were not professionals in this field and were not required to attend.

"Please be seated, Captain Liu. The report you sent over this evening was excellent and very valuable. Now we'd like to hear the verbal report," Wen Desi said.

"Thank you. Which part should we start with?"

"Let's start with the issue of the biological guide."

"For that, I suggest Xiao Bai report. He's more of an expert."

Bai Guoshi began his report: "The main reason for creating a biological guide is that the Ministry of Health has reported several incidents of people eating poisonous mushrooms. The cafeteria, fearing poisonous mushrooms, has refused to use any wild fungi. There are also harmful organisms here that have attacked both transmigrators and our laborers. So our idea is to compile a set of biological guides. For now, we'll start with two types: one for local edible or usable animals, plants, and wild mushrooms for all departments to reference; and a second, a handbook of harmful organisms, including various poisonous snakes, insects, parasites, and toxic plants, for safety education. We've already started working on the first guide."

"Good idea." The Director of the General Office, Xiao Zishan, nodded. "We can even color-print and publish it in the future. One copy for everyone." The other committee members also nodded in agreement.

"In the future, these identification guides can be expanded to other areas, including minerals..."

"And there's the issue of our department. Regarding the remote exploration team itself, we believe the current number of personnel is far from sufficient and urgently needs to be increased. With only one team, if we are ambushed in the field, the transmigrator regime will lose its entire remote exploration capability. I personally suggest establishing at least three six-person reconnaissance teams, trained using a veteran-mentoring-rookie model. This would prevent a specialty from being lost if a professional dies—our line of work is high-risk, and this is always a possibility. Furthermore, having three teams would allow us to conduct surveys in two directions simultaneously, while leaving one team on standby. We need at least 12 more people, preferably with some outdoor experience, and ensure each team has one member with military service experience. As for equipment, we have very few shotguns and won't request more, but we need at least six more steel crossbows and three more walkie-talkies to ensure each team has one gun, two crossbows, and two walkie-talkies. We also request absolute power usage rights for two more laptops to ensure we can process intelligence and compile the guides..."

The more Bai Guoshi spoke, the more excited and fluent he became. Suddenly, he noticed all the committee members staring at him with astonishment. A chill ran down his spine. He had gotten carried away—these were Liu Zheng's lines! How could he upstage his leader and steal his report?

"...Well, that concludes my report... it was very incomplete..." Bai Guoshi began to stammer.

"Thank you for your report," Wen Desi said quietly.

After Bai Guoshi finished, Cui Yunhong reported on the mineral discoveries from this expedition, focusing on the discovery of the kaolin deposit and the speculation of a nearby lignite mine. Neither of these resources was urgently needed, and there was a Weisuo city nearby—which, according to Yu E'shui's research, was likely the garrison of Lingao's Rear Thousand-household Command.

"Let's just wipe out that Thousand-household Command," Ma Qianzhu said. "Thousand-household Commander Liu is already a figure of public resentment. Getting rid of him could win us the allegiance of a large number of military households."

"It should be an easy fight. The defensive capabilities of the command are very poor," Liu Zheng said. "I don't see any real self-defense capability. I've detailed the situation in my report. In my opinion, it's weaker than Lingao County—at least Lingao's walls are higher."

"We'll discuss this later." The conservative faction was still hesitant about directly attacking a Ming government institution.

"We can launch resource expeditions. We'll use force to protect laborers while they gather resources. We can mind our own business and they can mind theirs," Wu Nanhai took the opportunity to present his idea, elaborating on its benefits.

"One trip to Wenchang, and we can get as many coconuts as we want, without having to pay for them," Wu Nanhai continued his incitement. "Right now, they won't even ship them to us even if we pay!"

"Why is that? Is the price too low?"

"The price we offered is double what they get in Qiongshan!" Mo Xiao'an said indignantly. Lin Quan'an, who had gone to the Wenchang area to purchase coconuts, had returned empty-handed, and several of his men had been beaten. The various "bosses" and monopolies that existed in the original timeline existed here as well—the dried coconut trade was monopolized by a few merchants in Qiongshan County, and outsiders were not allowed to interfere. No matter how high a price he offered, the coconut farmers didn't dare sell to him.

"What is the exploration team's opinion?"

"We have no objections. If the Executive Committee organizes it, we will be the vanguards and guides."

"Alright, we'll discuss the details after the meeting," Ma Qianzhu agreed.

"Also, the exploration team needs a survey ship. That way, we can conduct a circumnavigation survey of the island and bring the survey team along—after all, traveling by boat is much safer than on foot. If there's trouble, we can just retreat to the ship."

The reasoning was so sound it was hard to refuse, but ships were a scarce resource.

"We can only allocate small coastal boats of ten or twenty tons, which probably aren't suitable," Wen Desi hesitated. "It will be some time before the larger ships are completed..."

"Director Wen, that two-masted fast sailing ship was promised to our Department of Maritime Forces!" Li Haiping, the representative from the maritime department, quickly interjected.

Wen Desi was in a difficult position. The Ministry of Resources' request was not unreasonable, but the Department of Maritime Forces' urgent need for new ships to increase their military and transport capabilities was also a reality.

"How about this: the ship and the sailors will remain under the establishment of the Department of Maritime Forces. The exploration team can requisition them when needed—with priority given to the exploration team's use," Ma Qianzhu came up with a compromise that offended neither side. "We're short on sailors right now, so it's better for them to be managed centrally by the maritime department."

"That works," Liu Zheng knew the chances of getting a new ship were slim. "But I hope the navy can help us with training in seamanship and the like, so we won't be helpless when we do get our own ships in the future."

"You can count on us for that, brother," Li Haiping readily agreed.
