Since D-Day, the transmigrators' diet had consisted of rice and seafood. After a month of eating seafood prepared in every conceivable way, few people had any interest left in it. Even Wu De's original seafood paella became incredibly boring to him after two weeks. Although he later presided over some improvements to the food, such as making smoked fish, fish sauce, and fish cakes, some of these items required a long time to mature, while others lacked necessary seasonings. Everyone had remembered to bring enough salt, but soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, cooking wine, and spices had been removed from the reserves. To many, these were products with no technical difficulty that could be produced, grown, or purchased after transmigration. They forgot that these things were not immediately available, and they had to eat every day.

The result was that both the smoked fish and the fish cakes tasted strange and unappetizing. Sometimes the food service department would improve the meals by using various canned goods from the reserves, but the quantity was too small for the population. A can of luncheon meat would be sickening for two people to eat, but for ten people, it was as if no one had eaten at all.

One day, [Wu Nanhai][y009] furtively gave Wu De a smoked sausage. This was something he wouldn't even look at in the other world, but now he found it incredibly delicious—even though it didn't even have pepper, only some garlic. [Wu Nanhai][y009] repeatedly told him to keep it a secret, especially from Nick. It was a horse meat sausage made from his "Blue Lightning." The remains of the Australian racehorse had thus been secretly and corruptly consumed as the private property of the agricultural group. The grave that Nick would visit from time to time was empty; even the bones had been secretly collected—[Wu Nanhai][y009] planned to use them to make fertilizer.

The few dead horses dragged back after repelling the "First Encirclement"—as everyone called the counterattack after the publication of the "Lingao Express"—were their first real improvement in food in over a month. And the six pigs sent by the local gentry this time became a rare delicacy in the cafeteria.

However, for [Wu Nanhai][y009] and the others, there was still a slight disappointment. These pigs were far inferior to the ones they had seen in the other world. They were small and lean, with stiff bristles, looking a bit like wild boars.

"Don't look down on them," Xiong Buyou, who had brought the pigs over, said, swallowing his saliva as he looked at the piglets. "These are Lingao pigs, a famous local specialty, always exported to Hong Kong. You know Lingao suckling pig? It's this kind of pig. Thin skin, small bones, tender meat, and a special aroma—"

He cast a greedy, wolf-like gaze over the piglets. "These are all thirteen or fourteen *jin*. Just the right age. They'll be fat and tender when roasted."

"Don't get any funny ideas. I was already planning to raise the piglets as breeding stock. Since you say this breed of pig is so good, we have to keep them even more."

"Are all the big pigs slaughtered?"

"That's right. Let's have a feast for everyone. I've already asked the Executive Committee," [Wu Nanhai][y009] said, looking at the pigs who were still rooting in the dirt for food, unaware of their impending doom. "I originally wanted to kill two, but the Executive Committee said if we're going to kill them, we might as well slaughter all six big ones. Instead of everyone getting just a small piece of meat, it's better for everyone to eat their fill. It's a reward."

[Wu Nanhai][y009] had already made plans for the gifts they had received. The two hundred *jin* of wine was a low-alcohol rice wine that could be used for cooking or making vinegar. The dressed deer was a butchered carcass, which would be made into venison jerky. This was easy to make. Although there were no spices, it tasted acceptable after being boiled in salt water and air-dried. It was easy to carry and could be stored for a long time. Unfortunately, the deer was delivered already killed, so the hide and offal were gone. The ox was a yellow cow, not strong enough for fieldwork in the southern paddy fields, but it could serve as a local dam for future beef and dairy cattle. The six large pigs were market-ready hogs, unsuitable for breeding. Although they could be fattened further, there was a shortage of feed, and continuing to raise them would only cause them to lose weight. So they were slaughtered and eaten.

As for how to use the pigs, everyone had come up with many plans. Pork belly and ribs would all be made into braised pork in soy sauce. The head meat would be made into braised meat—though there were no spices for now, it would be stored in the refrigerator with the premium cuts like pork chops and tenderloin, which had been removed from the kitchen of the *Fengcheng*. The trotters and spareribs could be used for soup, and the leg meat and shoulder meat for ground pork. All the fat would be rendered into lard, and the cracklings used for stir-frying. The bones would be used for soup. The brain and spinal cord were collected separately. The blood and offal were all delicacies. The inedible offal, such as the pancreas, bladder, gallbladder, and spleen, had other uses and were also frozen. Finally, even the skin was prepared to be deep-fried into pork rinds for cooking—[Wu Nanhai][y009] really wanted the complaints about the food to stop for a few days. The things that were truly inedible were dried by [Wu Nanhai][y009] to make feed powder.

This comprehensive utilization plan, however, ran into a major problem—no one knew how to slaughter a pig. To these transmigrators, a pig was just the red meat on a butcher's block or in a supermarket freezer. How to turn a live pig into pork was a difficult puzzle to solve.

[Wu Nanhai][y009] found Yang Baogui. Because he had successfully helped the food service department dissect and butcher several dead horses, everyone naturally thought the task of slaughtering pigs could also be given to him. But the veterinarian shook his head repeatedly, saying that while it was easy to take a pig's life, slaughtering a pig was a skilled job. If done poorly, the meat would be ruined. He even cited the example of the European Union. In order to implement animal humanitarianism, the EU had changed the centuries-old method of slaughtering pigs to an electrocution method that complied with animal humanitarianism. As a result, pork in the EU was now incredibly unpalatable.

In the end, the veterans from the military group solved the problem. Every company in the army raised pigs. When it was time to improve the food for the New Year, the mess squad would organize the slaughter. Some had even helped in the mess squad. A few veterans rolled up their sleeves, boiled a large pot of water, and slaughtered all the pigs in no time.

A quarantine team composed of Yang Baogui and Shi Niaoren conducted a relevant inspection on the spot and believed that the pigs were healthy. There were no serious parasitic infections, but they still instructed that all meat must be cooked thoroughly.

That night, several large pots of braised pork in soy sauce were cooked in the cafeteria. The braised pork, seasoned only with salt, soy sauce—a very poor quality solid soy sauce—and cooking wine, received unanimous praise. Even the girls who were usually afraid of gaining weight and didn't like to eat meat joined the chorus of demanding more and complaining about the small portions. [Wu Nanhai][y009] saw someone actually shed tears while eating.

"Meat is still the best." This was the unanimous conclusion of the transmigrators who had eaten seafood for nearly two months.

But these few pots of braised pork also used up the last bit of soy sauce they had found in the ship's kitchen. [Wu Nanhai][y009] planned to find a place to buy some soy sauce and seasonings—he had brought fermentation cultures, but the Agriculture Committee had too much to do at the moment.

As the entire industrial focus shifted to Bairen Beach, various supporting buildings were completed one after another. The Agriculture Committee's various belongings also had to be moved to Bairen City. [Wu Nanhai][y009] traveled back and forth between the two places every day, cleaning and transporting items. Although he was a member of the Executive Committee, he rarely used the Beijing 212 according to his rank, always trying to catch a ride on the farm vehicles traveling between the two places. After the move, the only things the Agriculture Committee left in Bopu were the Bopu cafeteria, guarded by a food service staff member, and the fishery production group managed by Chen Haiyang, a former navy man, now a fisherman. Chen Haiyang submitted a report to the Executive Committee: requesting the establishment of a navy with the fishery group's existing ships and personnel as the core, concurrently engaged in fishing. The Bopu camp area could be managed by the navy. As for future maritime trade, shipbuilding, and other aspects, the navy could also manage them.

Navy! [Wu Nanhai][y009] thought. They hadn't even solved the problem of eating, and someone was already thinking of building a navy. Seeing the tent he had lived in for more than a month being dismantled, he couldn't help but feel a little sad. He threw the few bundles of nylon nets that Wu De had given him onto the farm vehicle. Wu De, the fisherman, was now happily serving as his labor reform captain, tormenting the natives every day, making them work and brainwashing them. If he had stayed in the fishery group, how could Chen Haiyang have suddenly come up with the idea of building a navy?

A long string of two-wheeled carts abandoned by the village militiamen during the counterattack was attached to the back of this farm vehicle. On them were tied the various belongings of the agricultural group: small farm tools, irrigation and drainage equipment, sprayers, a full set of agricultural technology experimental equipment, veterinary instruments, seeds, and many cages containing chickens, ducks, rabbits, and other livestock... The farm vehicle had been relegated to the status of a train here. Although he didn't know much about cars, he thought this was definitely not okay. But in difficult times, they had to make do. He hoped the vehicle would hold up until all the items were transported.

Yang Baogui waved a homemade whip, directing his six dogs to run back and forth along the road, driving the newly formed marching formation: a few pigs, a pair of donkeys, and three horses. These large animals did not enjoy the treatment of riding in a vehicle and would march to their new home on foot. These breeding animals were very precious, and the military group had sent seven or eight people to escort them.

"Old Yang, thank you for your hard work," [Wu Nanhai][y009] walked up to him. "Let's go together." Animal husbandry was not his specialty, and he wanted to take this opportunity to have a good chat with the veterinarian.

"It's a long way, about ten kilometers. Can your body handle it?" Yang Baogui looked at his slightly chubby body.

"What are you talking about? I'm younger than you." This man with dark skin and a pair of black-rimmed resin glasses on his nose looked to be at least thirty-seven or thirty-eight.

"I'm a veterinarian, and a rural veterinarian at that. Walking more than ten kilometers a day is a piece of cake. Although there are roads to every village now, there's always only one car, and it's always being driven by someone who isn't making a house call." Yang Baogui shook his flat-top buzz cut. [Wu Nanhai][y009] noticed that, like himself, he had tied the two arms of his glasses with a string and hung them around his neck. This commonality greatly increased his favorable impression of him.
