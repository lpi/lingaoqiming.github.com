"Surrender and you will be spared!" At the shouts of the marines, many people soon stumbled out from below deck and from behind piles of cargo. One by one, they knelt on the deck, dejected, awaiting their fate. Ruan Xiaowu ordered them to be tied up and sent off the ship to be escorted back to Lincheng for interrogation.

Next, they found many more bound people below deck, all sailors and merchants from the ship. Ruan Xiaowu couldn't be bothered to sort through them one by one and ordered them sent back to Lincheng as well. These unfortunate souls trembled with fear, not knowing into whose hands they had fallen this time.

Ruan Xiaowu led his men down another level to search. The cargo hold below deck was filled with goods. It seemed the pirates hadn't had time to take much—besides, their main targets were valuables, and they had no interest in heavy cargo like porcelain. Although the hold was in disarray, most of the goods were still there.

"So much good stuff," a few marines whispered among themselves. From the first day of enlistment, the discipline of "all spoils must be turned over to the public, no private hoarding of loot, no plundering of the people's property" had been repeatedly drilled into them by the transmigrator group. They knew the consequences of breaking the rules were terrifying. But even so, when a large amount of wealth appeared before them, it was inevitable for their minds to wander. However, the young cadet before them had an incorruptible and impartial look on his face, so the soldiers dared not think any further—this was the exemplary role of an officer.

"Seal all hatches," Ruan Xiaowu commanded. He then arranged for men to clean up the bodies and scattered cargo, waiting for the support team to take over.

Chen Haiyang was overjoyed to receive the report. The recent anti-piracy operations had been a thankless charity case, yielding nothing more than a few battered small boats and a group of ragged prisoners. Now, hearing that they had stumbled upon such a huge prize—a four to five-hundred-ton junk, fully loaded with cargo—he even dispatched the Type 67 landing craft, which he was usually reluctant to use, carrying a company of marines and three cannons to guard the prize against anyone trying to snatch it.

When Wen Desi heard they had acquired a large ship, he couldn't be bothered with his pile of administrative tasks. Using the excuse of needing to organize a work team to help refloat the ship, he set off with the vessel. Of course, the landing craft also carried a member of the Planning Committee—to register and receive the spoils. The Planning Committee members were now known as the "ubiquitous vultures." This "vulture" was a young man named Sun Xiao. He wore a black homespun work uniform with a red armband bearing the seal script character for "Planning." He carried a special homespun satchel for Planning Committee personnel, much larger than the ones used by the Army and Navy, capable of holding more ledgers and loose-leaf paper. On it were embroidered four large red characters: "For Planning Committee Use Only."

"A five-masted ship!" When the large junk came into Wen Desi's sight, he couldn't help but slap the handrail. It was the first time he had seen such a large Chinese sea vessel with his own eyes. Such ships were never seen in the waters off Lincheng! This was a huge gain.

Zhan Wuya was also surprised to see such a large wooden ship. "At least three hundred tons!"

"You're underestimating it. This ship has a displacement of five to six hundred tons," Wen Desi was very knowledgeable about this.

"Can traditional Chinese wooden ships be built this large?"

"The ten-thousand-ton wooden ships some people boast about are impossible to build. Among common Chinese sea vessels, the Spanish recorded eight-hundred-ton junks trading in Manila. A ship of five or six hundred tons is not a rarity."

The landing craft met up with the 101 patrol boat next to the sandbar. Le Lin had been waiting anxiously. Seeing that Chief Wen had come in person, he hurried over to report.

"Not now. First, tell me if there are any problems with the patrol boat." This was the first time the patrol boat he had designed had seen combat, and Wen Desi was eager to hear the direct feedback from the front-line personnel.

"Very good."

"Very good?" Wen Desi thought this feedback was too simple, but at least it meant there were no major problems.

"Are there any issues?"

"Well—" Le Lin couldn't think of any specific problems at the moment; the after-action review hadn't been held yet.

"The machine gun gets too hot. The wooden stock was about to catch fire after less than ten plates of ammunition."

"Theoretically, it shouldn't," Wen Desi thought. The Army's Minie rifles could fire a dozen or two dozen rounds continuously without showing signs of catching fire. How could a single barrel overheat after just ten shots?

"It's true. And the vibration is too great, no accuracy, chaotic trajectory, but the power is good."

"It's possible," Zhan Wuya said, looking at the "Typewriter." Two gunners were dismantling the cooled barrels one by one to clean them. A major problem with paper cartridges was the large amount of residue left in the barrel.

"Clustered barrels, no cooling mechanism, and they're fixed directly together, making heat dissipation even more difficult."

"Submit a report to the Engineering and Energy Committee's weapons group when you get back. See if they can add a heat sink or something," Wen Desi wasn't very interested in this multi-barreled gun. In his view, making a Maxim gun with their stock of spring parts was a piece of cake. This retro-style weapon was only created because of the difficulty in mass-producing metal cartridges.

"How are the sails and rigging?"

"Agile in turning. Chief Wen, you designed this ship very well," Le Lin had now learned to flatter his superior.

The 101 patrol boat had performed well overall in the battle. The hull and deck facilities had not suffered any major damage, and casualties were minimal. Of course, the intensity of the battle itself was not high, as the pirates had no determination to fight to the death. However, this was in line with its design purpose.

As for the prize, Le Lin said the entire ship had been searched, and all people, living or dead, had been cleared out.

"...The prisoners have all been transported away, and the bodies have been thrown into the sea. There's still a lot of cargo on this ship, and we don't have enough boats to unload it all at once. Maybe we should just wait for the ship to float and sail it away directly."

"The cargo must be unloaded, or the ship won't float," Wen Desi looked at his watch, then at the sea. It was already high tide, and the sandbar was completely submerged, but the ship was still aground, not moving an inch. It was clear that relying on the tide's power without unloading was impossible.

"Let's circle the ship and take a look."

A few men rowed a sampan around the large ship. The bow was aground on the sandbar, stuck deep, as if the helmsman had rammed it straight on in a panic.

"It seems to be stuck deep. It won't float without external force," Wen Desi assessed.

Meng De said, "It's not that simple. The bow must have been damaged by such an impact. You can see it's starting to sink. We need to pump out the water and repair the bulkhead first."

He glanced at the sea, then at the slightly tilted hull, and said, "Currently, we have two ways to get it out: one is to wait for the next highest tide and use a boat to pull it off the shoal; the other is to use flotation barrels to lift it."

"We have plenty of iron barrels, but they are all being used by various units right now. We'd have to ask everyone to empty them," Zhan Wuya hesitated. The main users were the departments under the Engineering and Energy Committee.

"Let's go with the first option. Leaving it here for too long could lead to trouble," Wen Desi said, feeling uneasy about this prize.

"How badly is the ship damaged?" Sun Xiao asked. The people sent by the Planning Committee were always haggling over costs and outputs, which was probably related to the fact that most of them were accountants.

"I don't think it's too badly damaged. The sails and rigging are a total loss, but the masts are all intact. We can patch up the sails—they don't have to be perfect, just enough to get it moving. Even if it's slow, it can still sail. If it's too slow, we can have the Type 67 tow it."

"That's a lot of work," Zhan Wuya said, looking at the huge hull.

"No problem. Get me Chen Haiyang on the line."

When Chen Haiyang heard that the large ship was loaded with spoils, he immediately agreed to send more ships and sailors to transport the cargo. Some necessary equipment and technical personnel were also sent along.

The highest tide would not come until nightfall. Wen Desi decided to make preparations first. The marines brought by the landing craft climbed onto the deck and quickly assembled a derrick. Then, they lifted the cannons, ammunition, and related supplies onto the deck. Wen Desi and the others also boarded the large ship.

The deck had already been cleaned by Ruan Xiaowu's team. The marines set up cannons on the sterncastle. They also erected a tent on the deck for Wen Desi and the others to use as a temporary command post.

After the reinforcements arrived, it took over a hundred marines five hours to unload the goods from the cargo hold and lift them from the deck to the sailing ships below to lighten the hull. The ship contained not only a large quantity of common export goods like porcelain, silk, and medicinal herbs, but also many low-value, bulky items like coarse pottery, ironware, and tinware. The transport fleet had to make several trips to unload two-thirds of the cargo. Wen Desi planned to use the remaining goods during the refloating operation.

When Meng De inspected the hull, he found two cracked seams on the port side near the waist. Fortunately, the ship was tilted slightly to starboard, so the openings were above the waterline. The ship had spare timber on board, and Meng De had the shipyard workers process it on-site to seal the gaps.

When inspecting the hull and bilge, Meng De found that it had not been heavily damaged by the grounding. There was water in the bilge, but it was not deep. The main problem was that the bow was deeply embedded in the sand, and it could only be pulled out at the highest tide.

After inspecting the interior, Meng De swam to the bottom of the ship, wanting to feel the exact location of the hole and see if the keel was damaged.

"There's a hole below, not big," Meng De's head emerged from the bilge water, panting heavily. "We have to pump the water out before we can patch it. We'll start pumping as soon as the tide begins to fall."

So, a water pump was hoisted up from the sailing ship. This pump was manually operated. The marines took turns pumping, and soon the bilge was dry. Several shipyard workers immediately began to repair the damage—they had to complete the patching before the tide rose again.

Finally, all the holes on the ship were patched. Then they began to clear the sails and rigging. The five masts were intact, but the sails and rigging on them had been destroyed in the fierce battle during the pirate boarding. They managed to salvage one usable sail and patched it with other remaining sailcloth and materials.

All that was left to do was to figure out a way to get the ship out. Unfortunately, the tide in the strait did not rise very high...

Wen Desi also instructed the marines to move the remaining cargo—ironware, coarse pottery, and the ship's spare grain—to the stern to weigh it down and help lift the bow out of the sand.

Finally, a steel cable was tied to the ship, with the other end fixed to the Type 67 landing craft. When the tide was full, they would use the buoyancy of the water and the power of the landing craft to pull the ship off the shoal.

By the time all this was done, it was midnight, and everyone was exhausted. The wind was dying down. Several former military men observed the color and formation of the clouds and noticed that the wind was tending to increase.

"This is a good thing. We can raise the sail then and use some of the wind's power," Meng De said. "Let's rest first. We'll have heavy work to do later."

Sleeping on the deck was no longer an option. The wind began to pick up, and to add to the fun, it started to rain. Everyone had to spend the night in the chaotic sterncastle—it had been ransacked by the pirates as it was the living quarters of the ship's important figures. They slept on the cabin floor in their clothes. The night watch was arranged by Le Lin's fleet.

In the latter half of the night, Wen Desi, who was dozing off, suddenly felt the ship shake.

"High tide is here! Everyone up!"

Everyone watched as long, small waves rolled in one after another across the sea. The sandbar gradually disappeared. The time for the refloating operation was approaching. A sense of impatience filled everyone's mind. They were all overly tense, and no one spoke, all waiting for the order.

Wen Desi had already gone down to the landing craft and was intently observing the tide. He glanced worriedly at the two long, taut steel cables.

"Raise the sail!" Wen Desi called to Meng De on the deck of the large ship via the walkie-talkie. "Mind the windward side!"

The hastily patched sail was raised on the mainmast—"Hard sails are so quick to raise and lower," Wen Desi thought. Before the thought had passed, at four o'clock, the tide reached its maximum height. It was that fleeting moment when the tide had risen but not yet begun to fall. They had to act now, without delay!

"Full speed!" Wen Desi shouted.

The main engine of the Type 67 immediately increased its power output to the maximum. Rows of colored indicator lights on the control console flashed wildly.

On the large ship, the sail was trembling under the force of the strong wind, making a tearing sound. Meng De noticed that the patches he had just made were already starting to split. He hoped they would hold until the ship was afloat.

The force of the wind, the action of the tide, and the pull of the landing craft. The hull of the large ship seemed to move, making a creaking sound.

"The ship is moving," Meng De, wearing a raincoat, shouted into the walkie-talkie hidden in his chest.

"Good. Tell everyone to be careful," Wen Desi's voice and the huge roar of the engine came through the walkie-talkie. Meng De couldn't help but look out at the lights of the landing craft on the sea—bobbing in the waves.

The water rose more fiercely, swelling the ship's belly and pushing it outwards. The people felt the hull tremble several times, as if it was about to float.

The wind blew even more fiercely. Meng De heard the creaking of the masts and the screaming of the ropes. The rain beat down so hard he couldn't open his eyes.

"The ship is floating! A little more push!" he shouted into the walkie-talkie.

"Already at overload—"

Suddenly, a fierce gust of wind struck, and the ship shook violently. The sail suddenly let out a sharp scream.

"Damn it!" Meng De thought, the sail had torn. Sure enough, a huge black shadow came crashing down on him, knocking him unconscious immediately.

But in that instant, the ship, propelled by this force, had floated free. It rocked violently on the sea, and the taut steel cables let out a terrifying shriek. On the landing craft, Wen Desi's legs went weak for a moment.

The ship finally stabilized in the wind and rain and was then towed away from the sandbar by the landing craft. When dawn broke, the fleet returned to Bopu. The arrival of this unprecedented five-masted Chinese junk caused a commotion on the shore, and many people came to watch.

Meng De was taken to the clinic in Bopu. Suspecting a fracture, a vehicle was quickly dispatched to take him to the Bairen General Hospital for an X-ray. After a consultation, He Ma announced that Meng De's life was not in danger: two broken ribs and a mild concussion—his helmet had saved his life, otherwise his skull would have been cracked. After the examination, Zhang Ziyi gave him a sedative injection to put him to sleep.

"Now I've lost a key captain and instructor," Chen Haiyang cried out about the heavy loss. Meng De would be out of commission for at least a few months.

"No problem, you got a big ship," Wen Desi said. "With some repairs and modifications, it can become a capital sailing ship."

The inventory of all the cargo on the ship took 48 hours to complete. Seeing the thick ledgers Sun Xiao brought, Ma Qianzhu felt like he had hit the jackpot. Not only was the quantity of goods large, but the variety was also extensive. Especially in terms of daily necessities, it would be of great help in alleviating the current shortage in Lincheng.

However, the cargo was strange. It was not packed and stacked by type but was a mixture of many different goods piled together, with different bamboo tags bearing names attached. It seemed to be the cargo of different merchants.

"Besides the ship's owner, there were probably several merchants leasing space on this ship," Ma Qianzhu said, looking at the name tags piled on the table.

"If they are still alive, it would be hard to justify confiscating their goods," Sun Xiao said.

Ma Qianzhu was unconcerned. "They're probably all dead. Unclaimed property belongs to the finder."

However, it turned out that Ma Qianzhu's wishful thinking was premature. Just as he was calculating the distribution plan with his calculator and a mountain of application forms from various departments, Ran Yao slipped in.

"Chief, there's a bit of a problem."

"What is it?"

"During the interrogation of the prisoners, we found that many of the merchants from the ship are still alive."

"Is that so!" Ma Qianzhu's pen involuntarily paused. A thought flashed through his mind. He slowly placed the pen on a jade pen rest and said, "It's hard to say. They are most likely pirates posing as merchants..."

"No, we found a passenger list on the ship with the guests' names and the quantity and type of their cargo. It all matches up upon questioning."

According to the results of the Political Security Department's investigation, the ship was built with funds from a gentry member surnamed Hai from Qiongshan County. Besides his own goods, there were thirty-eight merchants on board, each with their own cargo.
