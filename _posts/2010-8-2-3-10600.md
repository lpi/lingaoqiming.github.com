The next day, the missionary work began to change. They continued printing leaflets—without them, there would be no audience. But when Lu Ruohua preached, he glossed over things like original sin and hell, focusing instead on various "miracles" and "resurrections."

After a few days of this, it actually started to have an effect. An old woman came to Bai Duolu, asking where their "temple" was. Lu Ruohua was overjoyed. He immediately helped her to the third courtyard, fussing over her and preparing to save her soul. But the old woman's body needed saving more than her soul—she had been in poor health for a long time and was hoping for some kind of remedy, like a pinch of incense ash or a talisman dissolved in water.

Lu Ruohua, true to his Jesuit training, didn't even flinch. Instead, he seized the opportunity to preach at length about how firm belief in God could bring salvation. He left the old woman so bewildered that she walked away with a small wooden crucifix.

A few days later—whether God had truly decided to reveal his power in this barren land or it was the effect of psychotherapy—the old woman returned to the church. This time, she respectfully asked to "receive" a larger "cross" to take home. Lu Ruohua was moved to tears. Back then, Matteo Ricci had spent years in China without baptizing a single person, yet he had opened up the situation so easily. He couldn't help but see Bai Duolu in a new light, and so the content of his "preaching" became more and more "in line with China's national conditions." In the end, he baptized the dazed old woman. Of course, whether it was to wash away "original sin" or "the root of her illness" was a matter of individual interpretation.

From that day on, Lu Ruohua's missionary work took off. Bai Duolu discovered that history had proven middle-aged and elderly women to be an endless source of vitality, a gold mine for recruiting activists for all sorts of social activities. Under the enthusiastic promotion and leadership of this old woman, many other women and elderly people came to "listen to the teachings." Although no one else was baptized for the time being, a crowd gradually began to gather in the evenings to listen to Father Lu's sermons. The long nights were tedious, and this provided a form of entertainment. Besides, this red-haired man was something of a novelty.

Lu Ruohua was quick to learn and adapt. In addition to his usual sermons on miracles, he also interspersed stories from the Bible—of course, what he said was "suggested" by Bai Duolu, to avoid any shocking material that might be too outrageous for the locals.

"Father, now that people are coming to hear the sermons, I think we can change the layout of the chapel a little," Bai Duolu said humbly one day.

"How should we change it?"

"I remember in Europe, the church was always a place for public gatherings, conversation, and socializing..."

"You are quite right," Lu Ruohua was greatly excited. "In the rural churches of France, there are even people doing business. This is also a village, with no distractions or entertainment, and no suitable place to gather."

There used to be a gathering place. The large banyan tree at the entrance of the village was a natural meeting spot, but more than a decade ago, when Dang Namen and the government forces were fighting back and forth in the area, they both chose that spot for their executions. To this day, dark stains—old blood—could still be seen in the cracks of the flagstones. The villagers now kept their distance from that place.

At Bai Duolu's suggestion, Lu Ruohua added more tables and chairs to the hall of the third courtyard, which had already been converted into a chapel. He prepared many torches, a large number of tea bowls and teapots bought from Lin'gao, and even added a stove specifically for boiling water. He turned the place into an evening gathering spot.

As for the crucifix on display, at Bai Duolu's suggestion, they replaced the terrifying crucifix of the Passion with a plain one. They also added a picture of the Madonna and Child to the church. This was the same principle behind the great popularity of Guanyin in Chinese Buddhism; in Catholic countries in Europe, the veneration of the Virgin Mary was also very popular.

After this careful renovation, the church became the local social center. The priest generously lit a large number of lanterns every day—so many that Bai Duolu had to return to Bairen several times to buy candles. Most farming families were reluctant to light lamps at night to save oil. The church not only had lights but was brightly lit, which immediately attracted many women who had work to do in the evening and young people who didn't want to go to bed early. They gathered to chat, listen to the red-haired priest tell a few Western stories, and hear some words of moral exhortation. Gradually, they became interested in his "preaching." The postal censorship department of the General Administration of Security received a letter from Lu Ruohua to the Jesuit Superior in Macau almost every three or four days, filled with passionate words.

Bai Duolu knew that missionary work in the countryside was difficult to start. But once a breakthrough was made, it could often sweep through the entire village very quickly. So he advised Lu Ruohua not to be anxious, but to focus his efforts on the family of the first baptized convert, to first secure one household as a "fortress." Lu Ruohua now relied on Bai Duolu as his right-hand man, following his every word. He showed great care for the family of Grandma Mei, the first to be baptized.

The bustling church made Du Wen very upset. Several times, she blamed Dong Weiwei for suggesting the idea to Bai Duolu.

"Now look what you've done! The masses have been won over by the foreign religion! How are we supposed to carry out our work now?"

"If we can't win them over, let them win them over first. It's better than this state of limbo," said Dong Weiwei, who had experience with township work. She knew that in places where the church had successfully preached, the social order generally improved significantly, and government work was also much easier to carry out.

"Besides," she added, "Wen Zong said this church is not a foreign religion, but a church with Chinese characteristics."

Du Wen continued to object. "I am against this method of using religion to confuse and deceive the people."

"Alright, let's not talk about these grand principles," Dong Weiwei said. "Now that the people are gathered, everyone has something to do in the evening. It's much easier to understand the social situation."

With such a gathering place for the villagers, the members of the training institute could easily blend in with the crowd. "Making friends" and gathering social intelligence became much easier and more convenient than before. Soon, their work with the masses made progress, and the team members collected a lot of basic information.

Unfortunately, Du Wen and Dong Weiwei, the two transmigrators, were unable to get involved in this matter. Even the work with women, which was most suitable for them, was difficult to carry out. This was not like Yanchang Village, where, with the introduction of the Tan family elders, Du Wen could easily talk to Tan Xiaoqin about women's liberation. Here, they knew nothing about sewing or spinning, couldn't speak the Lin'gao dialect, and simply couldn't connect with the local women. Sitting in the church and chatting with people was also unsuccessful—everyone was a little afraid of them, after all, they were "female officials."

Dong Weiwei thought for a long time and decided to use her knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine to get closer to the masses. She had several handbooks on common Chinese medical treatments, and she came from a family of traditional Chinese doctors. She had also learned a little about massage and acupuncture, which she could now put to use.

Du Wen couldn't think of any other way to help, so she became her assistant. She might not have had any special skills, but she had strength. Learning massage was not a problem. The two women set up a stall in the church to practice medicine. This move was immediately met with great enthusiasm. Rural areas generally lacked doctors and medicine, and women in particular rarely had the opportunity to see a doctor. Many of them suffered from various ailments. Dong Weiwei found herself acting as a general practitioner, practicing medicine with the little knowledge she had accumulated. She had to see several female patients every day, which often threw her into a panic, afraid that she would one day harm someone.

But she couldn't back down now. She wrote a very sincere letter to the Ministry of Health, asking them to send their only traditional Chinese medicine expert, Liu San, to help, at least to solve the problem of medicine. For now, her prescriptions were almost useless—they had to go to the county town to get the medicine, and the peasants didn't always have cash on hand.

Even so, the local people were very grateful for their actions. They were finally able to have direct contact with the local masses.

The two women worked day and night. The kerosene lamp was often lit all night as they repeatedly studied the materials collected from various channels. The box Du Wen used as a file cabinet was beginning to pile up with written materials. Her notebook was filled with phrases like:

"Liu Dazhu, poor peasant, wavering attitude."

"Wang Wu, rich peasant, hates the bandits. Not resolute in the struggle."

...

Most importantly, they had gathered a lot of information about the bandits' families in the village. Through the students of the training institute, they had also secretly contacted many of the bandits' victims. Every night, people would sneak in from behind the church in the third courtyard to have secret talks in the second courtyard. When they spoke of their sorrows, someone would always cry. Women have soft hearts and are easily moved to tears when they see others cry. This unexpectedly made it easier to win people's hearts—everyone said the two female officials were kind-hearted.

These victims were carefully selected by the trainees—they only had deep conversations with those who had a blood feud with the bandits. When they talked about the bandits, they all gritted their teeth and wept bitterly. However, even so, Du Wen's hope of first mobilizing them to organize a core militia and then mobilizing the masses was still in vain.

Most of the young and able-bodied men in the victims' families had been killed; the bandits also understood the principle of cutting the weeds and digging up the roots. Those left behind were either old people or women and children. In the few families that still had young men, the elderly were afraid that their only heir would meet with misfortune, and so their attitude was negative.

Half a month had passed like this, and there was still not much progress. Daolu Village was able to maintain a superficial peace, but in the other villages of the Thirteen Villages area, an incident occurred where a group of bandits returned to replenish their food supplies.

Although this group of bandits was quickly eliminated by the pursuing bandit suppression team, the unconsolidated situation in the Thirteen Villages area was obvious. This news also appeared in the internal bulletin. Du Wen was extremely anxious. The telegram from Ma Qianzhu only instructed them to pay attention to their safety and had no words of blame, but the two women still felt immense pressure.
