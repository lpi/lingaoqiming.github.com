Not a single Traverser in the entire Fanhaijin was a sericulture major. [Wu Nanhai][y009] was very worried about Li Yo'er, this self-taught agricultural technician. Therefore, they had experimentally raised autumn silkworms in Lingao, letting Li Yo'er operate strictly according to the books. The final results proved that agricultural technical books and educational films were indeed very accurate guiding materials. Whenever a problem arose, she could always solve it by following the instructions.

With the silkworm house completed, Li Yo'er established a sericulture production team on the estate. Since the current servants on the estate all had jobs, the members of the production team were mostly refugees from the charity hall—sericulture households were given priority. These dozens of families were settled in a dedicated residential area. The men were responsible for reclaiming land and planting mulberry trees, while the women were responsible for raising silkworms. A dozen or so students were also selected from the estate's charity school to be trainees in the sericulture training class.

A major task of the sericulture production team was to open up mulberry groves and plant mulberry trees, further expanding the mulberry planting area. Although the mulberry trees planted last year and this year could not be harvested for leaves, they would be of great use in the future. In the Agricultural Committee's Jiangnan plan, the future Phoenix Mountain Estate would be the location of an agricultural vocational school, so laying a solid foundation was definitely not a loss. It was no wonder they invested so heavily.

Mulberry trees are highly adaptable and can grow in poor or fertile soil, in dry or humid areas. They are easy to plant and manage, have few pests and diseases, but have high economic benefits. Mulberry leaves, in particular, in the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, could be sold for three mace of silver per dan. The average yield at that time was twelve dan of mulberry leaves per mu. Even without raising silkworms and reeling silk, just selling the mulberry leaves could generate an income of three taels and six mace, equivalent to the income of a top-quality paddy field that could yield three shi of rice per mu.

However, top-quality paddy fields that could yield three shi of rice were rare, and whether they could harvest so much rice every year also depended on luck. Mulberry trees, on the other hand, could be planted on slopes and in corner plots, and their leaf yield was relatively stable. They also provided additional income from firewood and mulberries.

In the Agricultural Committee's mulberry grove in Lingao, using modern dense planting techniques and fruit-and-leaf dual-purpose mulberry trees, under strict management, they could achieve a yield of 2270 kilograms of mulberries and 1900 kilograms of mulberry leaves per mu.

Here in Hangzhou, it was impossible to have the same agricultural technology and resources as in Lingao, and the water and heat conditions were also slightly inferior, so the estimated yield was much lower. The varieties planted were mainly leaf mulberries, with only about ten mu of fruit-and-leaf dual-purpose mulberries planned.

By visiting the members of the production team, Li Yo'er learned that the local mulberry groves were basically planted with "high-stem mulberries" at a standard of 260 trees per mu. The leaf yield varied depending on the level of management and the amount of fertilizer applied, but an average monthly yield of 800-1200 jin of mulberry leaves per mu was achievable.

With the high-yield mulberry cuttings introduced by the estate and scientific management, Li Yo'er was confident that she could achieve a yield of 1000 kilograms per mu.

That being said, this was something for a few years later. For now, the sericulture industry at Phoenix Mountain Estate had to rely on purchasing mulberry leaves from outside. Mulberry leaves could not be picked in advance and had to be purchased from the market. Once the silkworms entered their third instar, the price of mulberry leaves would skyrocket, and there might even be a situation where they were unavailable at any price. Therefore, how to ensure the supply of mulberry leaves for the sericulture production team became Zhao Yigong's most important task.

The simplest method, of course, was to acquire a mulberry grove or directly purchase mulberry leaves. Acquiring a mulberry grove was the most secure option, but it was not easy to buy a suitably located one at short notice. The sericulture farm was at Phoenix Mountain Estate, and if the mulberry grove was too far away, the transportation costs would be too high. Moreover, the taxes on mulberry groves were very heavy. The mulberry groves opened up on Phoenix Mountain Estate were all reclaimed land. As long as the yamen was properly bribed, the taxes could be hidden and avoided. But it was much harder to avoid taxes on already registered mulberry groves. Zhao Yigong, being cautious, decided not to buy a mulberry grove for the time being. This year, Li Yo'er's work was mainly breeding and experimental silk reeling, and the demand for mulberry leaves was limited, so buying from the market was acceptable.

Originally, he was not too concerned about the supply of mulberry leaves. Matters that were a heavy burden for the common people were a drop in the bucket for him.

However, since he had the idea of establishing a sericulture cooperative to control the sericulturists and thus the cocoons, he had a new idea. According to various intelligence reports he had gathered, the sericulture industry in Jiangnan, like the sugar industry in Leizhou, was highly dependent on loans.

In this industry, whoever could control the loans could get the biggest piece of the pie.

Controlling the farmers through loans was a common tactic of the Tiandihui. In Leizhou, they had also used this method to gradually establish the Leizhou Sugar Industry Combine. Therefore, he had long been preparing his own small-loan plan and had even asked the Hangzhou branch of Delong to come up with several proposals.

Moreover, last autumn, the northern part of Zhejiang, the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, had suffered a severe drought. It had not rained for seventy consecutive days from August to October, and the rural areas were in extreme distress. Although the abundant produce of Jiangnan prevented a large-scale peasant uprising like in the north, the sericulture households would now be in more urgent need of loans to resume production.

However, he soon discovered that his plan was too idealistic. This was not Hainan, where the Fanhaijin held political power, nor was it Leizhou, which was controlled by the Leizhou Sugar Company, a trust backed by force. Here, he had neither a political basis of force nor an economic monopoly. To promote a new thing like a cooperative, he faced a state of complete distrust.

Originally, Zhao Yigong had planned to have Delong set up agencies in several towns with developed silk and cocoon trade to provide loans to sericulturists. But he soon found that small-scale rural credit in this era was almost entirely controlled by local landlords and wealthy middle peasants. The silk and cocoon guilds and the green leaf guilds also had a hand in it. The common feature was that there were many lenders, but each lender's lending scope was very small, basically limited to their own village.

In an era where most peasants' range of activity did not exceed fifty li from their homes, and they only went to the county town a few times in their lives, it was a pipe dream to expect them to come to a bank for a loan. Moreover, peasants were very suspicious. They would rather trust the local usurers than a suddenly appearing bank, let alone a cooperative.

The sericulturists had operated this way for thousands of years and would not easily join a suddenly appearing "cooperative." To get the sericulturists to join the cooperative and accept modern sericulture technical guidance, there had to be a model to demonstrate the various benefits of joining the cooperative.

During the Republic of China era, when the Suzhou Sericulture College promoted sericulture reform in the local area, they also specially set up a promotion office in Kaixiangong Village. Through continuous promotion and publicity, they gradually carried out the sericulture reform. If not for the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, it might have become the first Chinese sericulture agricultural cooperative organization in the local area. In fact, Kaixiangong Village and some nearby villages at that time already had such a trend.

Simply staying at Phoenix Mountain Estate and engaging in closed, small-scale production would never lead to the creation of a cooperative. The four words "go deep into the grassroots" were not said for nothing. Even the most successful Japanese agricultural cooperative organizations had to spend a great deal of effort in the beginning to persuade and mobilize farmers to join.

In recent years, floods and droughts have been quite frequent in Zhejiang. Although the consequences of these disasters were not as severe as in the northern and central plains at that time, the entire rural economy was still greatly damaged, and there were many disaster victims without food or clothing. Since he had already contacted the gentry to set up a charity hall to shelter and send away refugees, this agricultural cooperative could also be operated under the banner of "post-disaster relief."

Under the pretext of organizing refugees for self-sufficient production, he would establish a demonstration cooperative for sericulture and silk reeling under the name of the Cihui Hall, using refugee women as workers. With the banner of charity and the backing of a group of Catholic gentry, as well as his connections with the Fushe, his sericulture agricultural cooperative project should not have any major problems.

He immediately called Li Yo'er and told her his idea. Li Yo'er had no objections, but she felt that since she had just started teaching students, she might not be able to handle it if the scale was expanded too much.

"It's okay," Zhao Yigong comforted her. "Many of the refugees we've taken in have experience in sericulture. As long as you strictly enforce the technical requirements and we provide good breeds, getting a good harvest won't be a problem."

"If that's the case, we'll have to set up a sericulture farm at the foot of the mountain as well," Li Yo'er said. "The charity hall has too many people and is probably not suitable for raising silkworms."

"The sericulture farm and silk reeling factory can be set up by the river, under the banner of the charity hall. It's like a charity factory. Of course, it should be close to the charity hall so that the workers don't have to spend too much time on the road."

"What about the mulberry leaves?" Li Yo'er was a little worried. "The silkworm eggs are no problem. We've shipped a lot from Lingao, and I'll breed some myself, but the mulberry trees on the estate are newly planted and not even enough for the breeding farm."

"I'm planning to buy *shaoye*."

"Buy *shaoye*?" Li Yo'er didn't understand the term and looked at him with a confused expression.

"It's a technical term," Zhao Yigong smiled. "From now on, you'll be the big boss of the sericulture cooperative. You'll have to understand a lot of the local dialect and jargon of this time..."

"Wait, I'm an agricultural technician. When did I become a big boss for you?"

"I think you're just right for it," Zhao Yigong said with an expression of "who else but you." "You understand the technology, and you're a Traverser, so you know how to organize people to work. There's no communication barrier between us. And you've been doing a great job leading the sericulture production team these past few days. Just think of this cooperative as the production team magnified ten times."

"But—"

"It's okay," Zhao Yigong continued to encourage her. "You don't have to be afraid of this or that. You should have understood our era these past few days. It's an era with no concept of human rights. Those women in the sericulture production team are nothing but slaves. Even if you beat one to death, you won't be held responsible..."

"Stop talking, that's exactly what I'm afraid of," Li Yo'er said with a frown. "I just feel that I'm not suited for this society—it's too different from Lingao. It's simply hell on earth..." She glared at Zhao Yigong. "I understand what you mean. There are no personnel arrangements, labor protection, or other such issues to consider here. We are just slave owners who open factories. We treat the slave workers with nothing but carrots and sticks, and as long as we teach them the technology well and make them work hard, that's all that matters."

Zhao Yigong cursed inwardly: The sentimental little bourgeois is at it again! But he maintained a pleasant expression. He had experience dealing with women and knew that whatever he said when they were emotional was wrong. It was better to let them vent first.

Unexpectedly, Li Yo'er fell silent after saying these few words. She was a fairly rational woman and soon realized the absurdity of her words. She had even promised to buy maids for her husband and had secretly and seriously considered how to "train" and "discipline" them after they arrived, how she could project the authority of a "mistress," and how the maids should be punished if they made mistakes... It was a mixed fantasy of the various palace struggle novels and dramas she had seen.

In the end, she was also full of joy at the thought of being a slave owner, of being a "superior." Her righteous words just now seemed like a slap in her own face, and she couldn't help but blush.

"I know. I accept this task—to serve the Fanhaijin!"

"To serve the Fanhaijin and the people!" Zhao Yigong corrected.

"Forget it," Li Yo'er said. "Let's not talk about this for now. What does 'buying *shaoye*' mean? Is the supply of mulberry leaves guaranteed? If we can't supply the mulberry leaves, we'll have to discard the silkworms, and the loss will be too great."

"No problem," Zhao Yigong explained that buying "*shaoye*" was actually a primitive form of futures trading. The customer would pay the mulberry grove owner in advance at a certain price to buy mulberry leaves and then collect the goods after they were picked. The transaction of buying "*shaoye*" was very similar to "buying green shoots" at that time. Both took advantage of the farmers' need for cash during the lean season before and after the New Year to buy futures products at a lower price. Of course, if there was a bumper harvest of mulberry leaves and a sharp decrease in sericulturists, causing the market to plummet, the buyer would naturally lose money.

However, in most years, the price of raw silk was high, and buying "*shaoye*" was profitable for both the merchants who operated the leaf market and the sericulturists. Many sericulturists who did not have their own mulberry groves or had insufficient mulberry leaf production would often take out usurious loans to buy "*shaoye*." This also gave rise to a special type of brokerage firm, the leaf firm, which engaged in the futures trade of mulberry leaves. The trading methods were also very flexible, including short selling, cash sales, and credit sales.

"If we don't consider speculation, since we have abundant funds, buying this kind of futures mulberry leaves is quite cost-effective. Although the current market price will certainly be higher than before and after the New Year, now is the lean season. Last year, there was a drought, and the grain prices on the market are high. When spring arrives, farmers will need to start their production activities and will be in urgent need of funds. Buying at this time will definitely offer a considerable discount."
