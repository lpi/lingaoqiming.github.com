Two hours before the First Fleet stormed into Liaoluo Bay, Xue Ziliang and his detachment were quietly navigating the Shijing River.

It was 4:00 AM, the darkest hour before dawn. However, Xue Ziliang dared not let his guard down. The moon was too bright, and if not for the heavy cloud cover, he wouldn't have risked moving so openly on the river.

The motorboat's engine produced a low hum under its suppressor. This boat was originally a lifeboat from the S.S. *Fengcheng*, capable of carrying up to twenty-four people along with necessary rations and drinking water.

Due to the limited supply of gasoline, these lifeboats had only been used for a short period during the initial landings before being put into storage. They were specially brought out of storage for this mission, and the machine works had custom-built suppressors for them.

The previous night, they had driven this same motorboat into Liaoluo Bay. Relying on a gasoline bladder towed behind the boat for refueling, they reached Baisha Village at the mouth of the Shijing River that night and lay low there.

Baisha Village was only six kilometers from Anping. Even at an economical speed, the journey would take less than an hour. The propeller churned the river water, creating a soft lapping sound. Perhaps because they were a considerable distance from the shore, the land was silent, without a single sound to be heard.

He glanced at his luminous watch. It was just past a quarter past four. They would be arriving at Anping soon. From this point on, they had to be extremely careful, as some people would be starting to wake up and move about.

Of course, even if someone spotted their strange little boat now, it wouldn't necessarily pose a threat. The common folk would most likely treat it as a curious tale of the "strange and supernatural," and it was unlikely they would be so zealous as to immediately run to Anping to report it. Even if they did, the motorboat was much faster.

The moon, flickering in and out of the clouds, made Xue Ziliang habitually tense. He preferred to carry out combat missions on overcast nights; a silhouette suddenly exposed by moonlight often drew fatal gunfire. Fortunately, in this timeline, besides themselves, no one could fire a threatening bullet from three hundred meters away, nor would they face a sudden spray of machine gun or automatic rifle fire.

Onboard the boat were the members of the operation team. The twelve men were armed to the teeth. Aside from their somewhat rustic, locally-made uniforms and BDUs, they were no different from the force reconnaissance teams he had once commanded. Their faces were also blackened with camouflage paint.

They were equipped with the carbine version of the FAL automatic rifle, featuring a short barrel and a folding stock. They also had one machine gun and two shotguns. In the center of the boat's deck, something was wrapped in a tarp and secured with ropes.

On the wide, open river, the team members were silent, only occasionally looking around anxiously and listening intently. The broad river was perfectly still, with not a single boat in motion, and only a few lonely fishing lights could be seen in the distance. The water lapped gently against the hull of the boat.

When the luminous hands on Xue Ziliang's watch pointed to 4:30 AM, the motorboat's engine fell silent. The boat glided slowly forward and finally came to a stop. Xue Ziliang carefully scanned the pre-arranged rendezvous point on the river. He used a tactical flashlight to send a light signal towards the shore. Once, twice... after the third time, a responding light signal flashed from the darkness on the shore. It was the two advance scouts he had sent out on foot the previous night, responsible for guiding their landing.

Xue Ziliang gave a soft whistle that cut through the night's darkness, signaling to his men that they had reached the landing spot. The men sitting on the gunwales picked up their paddles and began to row carefully. Xue Ziliang held the engine tiller tightly with his right hand to control the speed, while with his left, he held a compass steady to maintain a precise angle with the navigation beacon on the shore.

Ten minutes later, Xue Ziliang heard the lookout he had posted at the bow whisper, "We're here." He quickly looked up. They were very close to land, less than 50 meters away. The moon was currently hidden by dark clouds. He could vaguely make out a dark earthen embankment ahead, with many trees on it. The air carried the foul stench of rotting aquatic plants.

The motorboat drifted towards the beach under its own momentum. A moment later, a soft scraping sound was heard as the boat's bottom made contact with the riverbank, and the motorboat ran aground on the sand.

A dark figure appeared before them, with phosphorescent identification strips on his chest and back. It was one of the men sent to meet them. He gestured, indicating the landing spot. Xue Ziliang carefully made his way around the piled weapons and equipment towards the bow. He extended one leg over the side to test the riverbank, holding onto a rope to prevent himself from sinking into the mud. According to their prior reconnaissance, the riverbank here was a mix of sand and gravel, but he still had to be extremely cautious.

Over the next five minutes, Xue Ziliang used his infrared binoculars to observe for any movement in the direction of Anping. The city was just 500 meters away, separated from them by low sand dunes and bushes. But for now, it was silent. Their arrival had not raised any alarm.

A road extended from Anping, passing about a hundred meters from the dunes.

The team members carefully unloaded the equipment from the boat one piece at a time. They then dragged the empty motorboat behind the sand dunes to conceal it, securing it with iron stakes and ropes to prevent it from being carried away by the tide.

Xue Ziliang climbed a sand dune and observed Anping with his infrared binoculars. The originally small coastal town had been extensively rebuilt by Zheng Zhilong into a grand fortress. It was surrounded by sturdy granite walls, and an imposing water gate stood majestically on the river. A 2.5-kilometer-long stone bridge, the famous Anping Bridge, spanned the river connecting Jinjiang and Nan'an counties.

Many boats of all sizes were anchored around the Anping Bridge. Among them were several of the three-masted gunships that the intelligence bureau had specifically pointed out.

However, their target was not these ships; that was the navy's job. Their primary mission was to carry out a "decapitation strike" against the Zheng family's leadership, attempting to kill several of their key figures.

With just their small team, a direct assault on Anping was obviously impossible. But Anping had only a few exits. By controlling a few key access roads, they could effectively ambush the enemy as they tried to flee. Even if they couldn't wipe them all out, they could at least inflict significant casualties.

He checked his watch. According to the plan, the detachments assigned to control the other two roads should have arrived by now. But so far, they had not sent the designated radio signal, which made him a little anxious.

He turned and ran back down the dune, whispering orders for them to prepare their weapons. The object wrapped in the tarp was unwrapped. Inside was a small, disassembled cannon. The metal parts had been wrapped in sackcloth to prevent them from making noise if they bumped against each other.

Under his direction, the cannon parts were carried up the dune, followed by ammunition boxes. Ying Yu opened his toolbox and began to assemble it. He worked quickly and quietly.

This dune's location had been chosen after multiple on-site reconnaissance missions. Firstly, it effectively controlled the road from Anping to Nan'an. Secondly, the distance from here to the center of Zheng Zhilong's mansion in Anping was only 704 meters. The idea of directly shelling the enemy's command center was very tempting.

Although the navy's fleet would bring a much fiercer baptism of fire to Anping upon its arrival, they couldn't deliver such a precise strike to the enemy's vital point.

"It's all up to you now."

"Don't worry. You should be more worried about the craftsmanship of Lin Shenhe and the folks at the machine works," Ying Yu replied.

After taking a bearing with his compass, he set up the gun position precisely on the compass point Xue Ziliang had indicated, with the muzzle aimed directly at Zheng Zhilong's mansion. Then, he carefully turned the elevation screw, striving to hit the center of the mansion with the very first shot.

Just a few shells landing in the center of the mansion would create enough shock and awe to break the enemy's will to fight. After all, assaulting the reinforced walls of Anping would require some effort. It was far better to make the enemy flee without a fight.

The weapon they were using this time was what Lin Shenhe had designed as the "Experimental Type 32 Battalion Gun." This cannon was originally intended to provide light artillery support for battalion-level units, replacing the 12-pounder mountain howitzer currently in that role. Therefore, it had to be as light as possible for mobility, have low logistical dependence, be capable of high-angle fire, and maintain a certain degree of accuracy and lethality.

The "Experimental Type 32 Battalion Gun" was a multi-purpose field gun designed based on these requirements.

The cannon had a 70mm caliber and was a rifled, breech-loading weapon. Although it was not a recoiling gun, it used a friction-based recoil absorption system. Because the gun barrel was relatively light, the recoil absorption was quite efficient, which significantly increased the rate of fire.

To reduce weight, the 70mm rapid-fire gun had a moderately shortened barrel. The ammunition it used consisted mainly of low-pressure high-explosive and shrapnel shells. The shells used separate-loading metallic cartridges to work with the gun's vertical sliding-wedge breechblock. This type of breech was easy to load quickly at high angles and balanced manufacturability with performance, given their current industrial capabilities. The wedge breech was simpler in structure than a screw breech, easier and faster to operate, and also safer.

Because of its rifled barrel, the loss of accuracy and muzzle velocity from the shortened barrel could be compensated for. However, since the pointed, cylindrical shells fired by a rifled gun could not ricochet, solid shot was no longer issued.

While reducing the weight of the gun, the firing elevation of the 70mm rapid-fire gun was significantly increased to up to 80 degrees, giving it some high-angle fire capability.

Broadly speaking, this was a knock-off version of the Japanese Type 92 infantry gun. However, due to limitations in materials and craftsmanship, the gun's dimensions and weight were slightly larger than the original Type 92.
