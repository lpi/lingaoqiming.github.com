Lin Ming knew this was the pimp's way of asking for a tip and, at the same time, sizing up the customer's wealth. Just as he was about to speak, Wang Xinglong, without a second word, pulled out a one-dollar coin from his pocket and tossed it to Little Six. Little Six became even more enthusiastic and led the two into a room with three foreign letters on the door.

The room was very dark, but it was clear the decorations were luxurious. The walls were covered in silk. There was little furniture, just a few wide chairs around a coffee table, and an exceptionally large mirror—it took up almost half a wall. Lin Ming was startled. Mirrors, like glass windows, were common in Lingao, but facing such a large mirror that could reflect a person's entire body was still very shocking. Little Six helped Lin Ming sit down on one of the large chairs; it was soft, comfortable, and springy. Lin Ming knew this thing was a sofa; he had seen wealthy families in Guangzhou and Foshan buy them.

"Master, this is an Australian-made chair called a sofa. Sitting on it makes your whole body feel comfortable!"

"Not bad, very comfortable." Lin Ming stood up and sat down again. "Little Six, how are we supposed to choose a girl in such a dark place? You're not trying to fool me, are you?"

"Oh, Master, how would I dare? Please sit and have some tea. I'll call the girls for you right away." After speaking, Little Six turned and left, returning shortly with a tray of tea and snacks. He said in a low voice, "Please enjoy. The girls will be out soon."

The tea and snacks on the tray were exquisite. Even more precious were the thin slices of watermelon. It was only early spring, yet there was watermelon! Lin Ming was secretly amazed. In Guangdong, eating a few cucumbers or green chives in winter was nothing special, but watermelon was unheard of.

Wang Xinglong picked up a slice of watermelon and started eating. Lin Ming grew anxious. He knew the rules of the brothels. This was called a "tea platter." The snacks looked exquisite, but the price was steep. One platter of snacks could cost as much as a top-quality banquet at a restaurant.

According to the rules of the brothel, if you took a single bite, you had to pay for the whole platter. If you didn't touch it, you didn't have to pay.

If this were the Great Ming, he, Lin Ming, wouldn't even pay when dining out, and visiting a brothel was him gracing them with his presence, let alone eating a few measly slices of watermelon. But this was Lingao, where the authority of the Jinyiwei didn't extend. He was afraid Wang Xinglong, being young and inexperienced, didn't know the rules and would spend money recklessly, causing a dispute if he couldn't pay and attracting the 髡 police. He broke out in a sweat from anxiety.

"Brother Wang, Brother Wang, why did you start eating already?"
"What, can't I eat?" Wang Xinglong looked bewildered.

"Ai! My dear brother, don't you know? This is a tea platter. One bite costs several taels of silver..."

Wang Xinglong laughed. "Don't worry, Brother Lin. This is Lingao, and they follow Australian rules here. You can eat as much as you want. It's included in the service fee. As long as you buy a 'bell,' it's all included."

"'Buy an end'?" Lin Ming only knew of "seeing someone to their end" (a funeral rite), he didn't know what "buying an end" had to do with carousing.

"It's buying a 'bell.' Just relax and have a few bites to tide you over. There's still some time," Wang Xinglong said, swallowing a slice of watermelon in a few bites. "The spring scenery is boundless. Brother Lin, just enjoy the view for now."

Seeing his confident and experienced manner, Lin Ming decided to go with the flow. He was indeed a bit thirsty. He picked up the tea on the coffee table and took a few sips. This tea was neither the oolong tea popular locally, nor the common Jiangxi or Fujian tea found in Guangdong. The liquid was reddish, almost black. It had a strong tea flavor, but the taste was sweet with a slight sourness.
"This is black tea. Like oolong tea, it's an Australian specialty," Wang Xinglong said. "In the summer, drinking it with ice is even more refreshing."

Lin Ming only had a bowl of Lingao noodles in his stomach. The strong black tea made his stomach feel a bit empty, so he took a piece of pastry. The taste was no worse than those made by the big shops in Guangzhou.

But what was the point of just sitting here facing the mirror? As he was wondering, the mirror suddenly lit up brightly. The inside of the mirror became illuminated.

Lin Ming jumped to his feet, dumbfounded. As the light grew stronger, the mirror in front of him gradually became transparent, revealing a lavishly decorated room. The floor was covered with a scarlet carpet, the walls were papered with beige silk, and in the four corners hung small, exquisite pink glass lamps, dyeing the entire room in a soft, crystalline glow.

Three beautiful young women with elaborate hairstyles appeared, all dressed in identical light, flowing gauze skirts. To call them skirts was an overstatement; they were merely two pieces of cloth, tied at the waist with silk ribbons, one in front and one in back. The sides were long slits. Raising an arm revealed a breast, and lifting a leg exposed the buttocks and thigh.

That was one thing, but what really made Lin Ming's nose bleed were the bodies hazily concealed beneath the gauze and the various seductive poses they struck.

A physiological change occurred throughout Lin Ming's body, just like when he watched the Persian dancers in Macau. He hadn't known the taste of flesh for over half a year. How could he withstand such a grand dish all at once? As his heart and soul wavered, he felt a hot surge in his lower body, on the verge of breaking through. Lin Ming cried out "not good" internally, immediately averted his gaze, guarded his mind, and breathed out secretly, thus narrowly avoiding a complete breakdown on the spot.

He didn't dare to look too much. He quickly drank some tea to compose himself. Wang Xinglong leaned over and asked, "Brother Lin, which one have you taken a fancy to?"

Lin Ming's mind had calmed a little. How could he dare to look more? He randomly said, "The one on the left."

Wang Xinglong pulled a cord, and the lights in the mirror immediately went out. The women inside also disappeared. Lin Ming didn't dare to stand up. He just continued to breathe in and out. He needed to properly calm his current state of mind to avoid making a fool of himself.

"How about it, Brother Lin? Was that a good view of the spring scenery?" Wang Xinglong was very pleased with himself.

Lin Ming nodded silently. Fortunately, the room was very dark—he knew his face must look terrible. Fortunately, the wide sleeves and long robes of the Ming dynasty attire concealed the still-present swelling in his lower body.

"The girls you two have chosen are waiting. Please follow me," Little Six came in, smiling. "Which package would you like?"

"Just the most common one you have here," Wang Xinglong waved his hand. "Just tell me the room number, I'll go myself. You can take Mr. Lin."

So Little Six led Lin Ming to another room. This room was much brighter, but the furnishings were very strange. Besides a simple cabinet, there was only a white bed in the room. The floor was paved with black tiles. A large, snow-white towel was spread by the bed. Seeing no chairs in the room, Lin Ming had no choice but to sit on the bed. The bed felt cold to the touch but wasn't made of stone. The surface seemed to have a layer of glaze, and it was slightly concave. It was very uncomfortable to sit on, nothing like the sofa.

As his mind was wandering, the door opened. Lin Ming's eyes lit up. The woman who entered was the same one who had been posing seductively in the mirror. She wore a wrap-around long robe, tied at the waist with a sash. Her hair was let down, loosely tied with a ribbon.

Lin Ming found himself at a loss for the first time in front of a woman. Thinking of his earlier embarrassing state, he couldn't help but give an awkward smile.

"Master, your servant greets you." The woman curtsied. From behind her, a smaller girl appeared, placed a basket by the bed, lit a stick of incense in the censer in the corner, then turned and left, carefully closing the door.

"Ah, uh, yes." Lin Ming felt he was being incoherent. This "Australian debauchery" was truly different. Even he, a veteran of the flower fields, was a bit at a loss.

"Master, please relax. Is this your first time here?" The woman picked up the basket and walked to the side. As she passed Lin Ming, her hand intentionally or unintentionally brushed against his sensitive area. "Master must have had a hard day. Look how hot you are. Let your servant help you bathe." The woman's movements were so elegant, with a hint of provocation.

"Good, good, good." Lin Ming swallowed hard.

"Master, please stand up and let your servant help you undress."

The woman undressed Lin Ming and then, led by her slender hand, he lay down on the bed. He found the bed was just right, perfectly fitting his well-muscled body.

After a rustling sound, the woman's voice spoke again:

"Master, please lie still. Your servant will bathe you now." As she spoke, there was the sound of flowing water. Lin Ming could clearly feel water spraying onto his back, but he hadn't noticed any water containers or sources in the room. As he was puzzled, Lin Ming felt a pair of small hands begin to wander over his back, from his shoulders to his toes, everywhere, even his toes were washed. The touch was neither too light nor too heavy, just right. Lin Ming had never experienced such enjoyment. The maids at home served him with all their heart, fearing his displeasure, but their technique and the sensation couldn't compare to this.

Then, the sound of water stopped. Something slippery was poured on his back. A faint fragrance like orchid and musk drifted past his nose. Then he clearly felt something else moving on his back. This time it was definitely not a hand. Lin Ming curiously looked behind him. A pair of not large but delicate and smooth white rabbits appeared before his eyes. They were working hard, jiggling and moving over his body. Then he heard the woman's panting. Lin Ming immediately felt a drastic change in his lower body and felt a painful pressure. Lin Ming kept wiggling his hips to maintain some space.

The woman might have felt something. "Master, turn over. Let your servant give you a 'roaming'."

Although Lin Ming didn't know what she was talking about, he still turned over, feeling a sense of relief.

"Oh my, Master is truly well-endowed... so magnificent," the woman said shyly.

Lin Ming didn't dare to open his eyes. He felt the water flowing over his body again. Curiosity made him want to open his eyes to see where the water was coming from. But as soon as he opened them, the pair of glistening large breasts were jiggling right before his eyes. This time he saw clearly: the woman was washing him with her pair of white rabbits. Lin Ming quickly closed his eyes. He felt like he was about to faint, his mind a complete blank.
