"These eight boats," Xu Ke drew a circle on the berthing chart, encompassing not only the eight primary targets but also a dozen or so surrounding vessels, "seize them all. Interrogate everyone and search the boats again!" He emphasized, "Especially search for any cylindrical objects. Saw open every single bamboo pole for inspection!"

"Yes, sir!" The Port Director didn't dare to delay and immediately went to gather his men.

But they were too late. As a sailor was splitting open a long bamboo pole, a short woman suddenly leaped into the sea. A waiting sampan immediately closed in. Just as someone was about to use a fishing net to haul her out, the cornered fugitive suddenly sank beneath the waves.

"Not good!" Xu Ke saw it clearly. Could there be a fourth killer? While directing his men to maintain a tight cordon, he scanned the surroundings for any suspicious individuals.

However, the body, once recovered, proved there was no fourth person. The dark-skinned, petite woman had a wooden splinter pierced through the palm of her hand—she had likely committed suicide when escape became hopeless.

Local fishermen identified her as a laborer from one of the fishing boats. The boat's captain, when questioned, said he had hired her as a casual worker on the docks in Fujian before setting sail. The woman claimed to be a Tanka, spoke Cantonese, and was very skilled at a fisherman's tasks.

The body was sent to Raine for a forensic examination. The police, meanwhile, searched the entire fishing boat and found the wooden blowgun concealed within a bamboo pole. The darts were attached to a fan-shaped wooden hairpin, worn in her hair bun. Its tip was covered by a small bamboo tube, making it look like the sword-shaped wooden hairpins commonly worn by Fujianese women.

"Our police personnel are too amateurish," he lamented in the infirmary's basement, standing over the corpse.

If it had been himself or anyone with a modicum of professional training, this woman would have been on the suspect list. But the fact was, she had never been considered a suspect.

"I find her features very unusual—not like a Han Chinese," Xu Ke said, studying the deceased's face.

"It's hard to say if the Tanka are Han Chinese," Raine remarked casually. "They are an indigenous people of Southern China, genetically quite distant from the Han."

"No, this person is definitely not Tanka," Xu Ke stated. There were many soldiers of Tanka origin in the navy, and their physical characteristics were very distinct: thick arms, large buttocks, a wide and stiff back, and inwardly curved feet—all traits developed from living their entire lives on boats. But this woman was slender, with thin arms and legs, and her feet were not curved inward.

"And she has no tattoos," Xu Ke pointed at the naked corpse. "Tanka people are always tattooed." He studied her for a while longer. "I think her appearance is more akin to someone of South Asian descent."

The identity of the deceased was now impossible to verify. A search of her belongings on the fishing boat yielded no leads: just some ordinary coarse cloth for a change of clothes, and a few scattered copper coins and pieces of silver. Clearly, this person had been extremely cautious, carrying nothing that could reveal her identity. Her suicide, upon realizing she couldn't escape, also suggested that the force behind her was not to be underestimated.

Xu Ke's brow furrowed tightly. Not only had the most crucial lead been severed, but the second uniform was also missing. He suspected the uniform had likely been destroyed, probably sunk in the harbor or burned. After all, if the person couldn't escape, the clothes wouldn't have run off on their own.

Nevertheless, all the collected clues pointed directly at Zheng Zhilong.

The next steps of the investigation were beyond the scope of his authority. He had to request instructions from Lingao.

Three days after Frans van den Burg's arrival from Tayouan, Westerly's funeral was held in Kaohsiung. Due to the hot weather, the body could not be kept for long, so at the request of van den Burg, who had rushed over from Tayouan, he was buried in Kaohsiung with Catholic rites. Wei Bachi, eager to curry favor, instructed Father Dermot to make it a grand affair. There were to be plenty of candles at the ceremony and multiple requiem masses—in short, everything was to be done with great pomp and circumstance. The effort nearly exhausted Father Dermot.

Wei Bachi and the Zhong Lishi father-daughter duo both attended the funeral. Van den Burg did not show overwhelming grief. Although his face had been deathly pale since he learned of Westerly's death, he maintained a calm—almost cold—composure with extreme restraint. Cretia, on the other hand, had fainted from crying several times. At the funeral, she wore full black mourning attire, her eyes red, and her golden hair only served to make her face look even more haggard.

"He always looked forward to seeing a new world..." Cretia choked out as she placed her bouquet on the coffin. Hearing this, Zhong Xiaoying couldn't help but shed tears as well.

The newly installed customs house clock began to toll, its chimes mingling with the church's funeral bells, echoing over the cemetery.

After the funeral, Wei Bachi paid his respects and offered condolences to the family. He then made a special visit to Huygens.

"Mr. Huygens," Wei Bachi said with a tone of sincerity and sorrow, "we have now determined that this act was not committed by our soldiers, but by a certain power from across the Taiwan Strait, with the intent to disrupt the friendly relations between the Senate and the Republic. We deeply regret this and extend our sincerest apologies and condolences to Mr. van den Burg's family. We will focus our efforts on bringing the culprits to justice to thoroughly uncover the true mastermind behind this case."

"I also find this matter deeply regrettable," Huygens replied in German. He offered his own diplomatic platitudes, stating that this incident would not affect the "friendship" between the Republic and the Senate. He also expressed his hope that the Senate would apprehend Westerly's murderer soon. Westerly's murder had indeed shocked him, and he felt sorry for the boy's sudden death. However, he didn't believe it would have a significant impact on the grander diplomatic stage. The deceased was just a teenager, neither an official of the Republic nor a high-ranking member of the East India Company.

Every year, hundreds of citizens of the Seven United Provinces died in East and Southeast Asia for various reasons, with a considerable number being murdered. If Westerly hadn't been the son of a high-ranking East India Company official, his death would not have caused the slightest ripple.

Just as Zhong Lishi and Wei Bachi had predicted, although Frans van den Burg was grief-stricken, the incident would not affect the cooperation between the East India Company and the Australians. Since the Company was willing to hand over its former governor of Formosa to the Japanese for trial and imprisonment in exchange for trade, the death of an official's son was of little consequence.

However, for the Senate, this incident was deemed to have "a malign influence." It wasn't so much about the serious consequences for the overall situation, but rather that it had wounded the lofty pride of the senators. Thus, less than three days after Xu Ke's report was submitted, an encrypted telegram arrived from Lingao with instructions from the Executive Committee: "Xu Ke is to form an investigation team to thoroughly uncover the truth of this case."

Wei Bachi's attempt to gloss over the matter was thwarted. The Executive Committee demanded he "immediately submit a detailed, accurate, and objective report on the course of events and their handling." This order was simultaneously sent to Xu Ke, Zhong Lishi, and Raine.

"Damn it, they want us all to write separate reports on each other!" Wei Bachi cursed after receiving the telegram. Putting other things aside, he had previously offended Xu Ke and Dr. Zhong—especially Dr. Zhong, whose daughter Xiaoying was the apple of his eye. Now, these two would surely take the opportunity to paint him in the blackest of terms...

He wondered if his previous "appeasement diplomacy" had been effective enough. Wei Bachi felt a growing anxiety. The excellent situation in Kaohsiung had just begun, and his grand ambitions were still on paper. He couldn't let this incident ruin his promising future. Wei Bachi pondered how he could further work on these two individuals...

The next morning at dawn, Cretia packed her belongings and left the church. Since the incident, she had been constantly praying for Westerly there. Today was the day Mr. van den Burg was to leave Kaohsiung and return to Tayouan. In a few days, they would depart for Japan.

Dr. Zhong and his daughter, along with Father Dermot, came to see her off. Zhong Xiaoying's eyes were red. Zhong Lishi stepped forward and said, "Miss Cretia, we are deeply saddened by what happened to Westerly. We failed to protect him, and we share the responsibility. We will certainly investigate this to the end and give you and Mr. van den Burg an explanation."

Cretia hesitated for a moment, wiped the tears from her eyes, and boarded the carriage without a word. Watching the carriage drive further and further towards the port, Zhong Lishi and Father Dermot couldn't help but let out a long sigh.

As Cretia reached the barrier outside the docks and was about to pass through, she heard a girl calling her from behind. She turned to see Zhong Xiaoying had caught up. Seeing her friend's reluctance to part, and thinking of the happy times she had spent with Westerly and Xiaoying, Cretia could no longer hold back. She threw herself into Zhong Xiaoying's arms and wept bitterly.

After crying for a long while, Zhong Xiaoying said to Cretia, "You are leaving, I had to come and see you off."

Cretia whispered in reply, "Thank you..."

"Miss Cretia, I will definitely help you find the killer..." she said in a low voice.

Hearing this, Cretia was deeply moved by Zhong Xiaoying's words. Her heart gradually calmed. She thought for a moment, wiped Xiaoying's tears, and said to her, "I understand. Wait for me here..."

Zhong Lishi and Father Dermot stood in the church's bell tower, watching the Dutch sloop moored at the dock. With a chime from the customs house clock tower, the Dutch sloop slowly pulled away from the pier. Watching the Dutch ship's sails recede into the distance, the priest made the sign of the cross, and Zhong Lishi sighed deeply. Just as the two were about to leave, they heard the sound of horse hooves. A carriage was approaching from the direction of the port.

The carriage stopped at the church entrance. To Zhong Lishi's astonishment, both Zhong Xiaoying and Cretia alighted from it. He rushed down from the tower to meet them.
