Wen Tong chose Xuwen as his base of operations. The Qiwei Escort Agency had already received instructions from their patron, Guo, to extend the utmost hospitality to this "Manager Wen." Hearing that Manager Wen preferred tranquility over the hustle and bustle of the city, Qiwei's Leizhou branch had constructed a new house for him on a sugarcane plantation just outside Xuwen County. The place was tidied up inside and out, complete with newly-made furniture. They had even planned to hire a few servants, but Guangzhou had already sent some over by mule cart, a move that left the branch manager speechless at the豪奢 lifestyle of these new managers.

Wen Tong and his men moved into the sugarcane estate, which was essentially a more refined farmhouse. Besides the house, there was a large yard specifically for stacking the harvested sugarcane. The earthen sugar mill stood just outside the plantation walls, another structure where several oxen were kept.

After a night's rest, Wen Tong inspected his new property. He had assumed a plantation like this would have managers and craftsmen, but upon asking, he found there was no one. The plantation, including the mill, had been the private property of a single farming family who handled everything from planting to pressing and sugar production. Once it was sold, there was naturally no one left to run it.

Wen Tong felt a bit troubled. Without locals to help, he was completely in the dark about the local situation. Moreover, sugarcane processing was a classic labor-intensive industry, requiring a massive workforce during the harvest season. In his own time, this was simple: farmers delivered their cane to the factory, which just had to weigh and buy it. Now, he had his own land with the cane still in the fields. He needed to hire temporary workers to organize the harvesting, cleaning, and bundling. This was a job for a professional landlord or a foreman, not a sugar factory manager like himself. How was he supposed to handle it?

He looked at the Qiwei escorts with him; they all stared back blankly, clearly out of their element. Seeing the troubled look on his face, Chang Shide asked, "A difficult task?"

"We're blind without local help," Wen Tong sighed. He called over Zhou Shizhai's young apprentice, Li Biao. The boy had already learned to speak fluent Mandarin in Lingao.

"Go and ask around the plantation. See if there are any cane farmers who bring their sugarcane here for processing. If there are, invite them to the estate. I have some questions for them."

"Right away," Li Biao replied and set off.

Wen Tong checked the land deed. The entire estate's sugarcane fields amounted to just over one hundred modern mu, a pitifully small scale. He then went to inspect the sugar mill.

He had visited traditional earthen sugar mills on the Leizhou Peninsula before, so he knew the process: "oxen pulling stone rollers to press the cane, pots and stoves to boil the sugar, and pottery vessels to separate the molasses." While primitive by modern standards, it was a relatively advanced technique for its time.

The mill covered a large area, used for stacking the cane to be processed and the resulting bagasse. The main structures were a conical shed and a large thatched hut. The entire setup was incredibly crude, built not with bricks or tiles, but with very little wood either. It was what they called "grass-thatched and mud-walled."

The thatched hut had a base of about fifty feet in diameter and was about thirty feet high, supported internally by bamboo poles. The roof was covered with thatch, rice straw, or sugarcane leaves. This was the pressing area. The sugar-boiling house contained a series of "Kongming" cauldrons for cooking the sugar. Inside were various pieces of equipment: wooden rollers, large pots, stoves, and earthenware jars.

Having been unused for several months, the place was covered in dust. The floor was just packed mud, littered with sugarcane leaves, husks, cow dung, and firewood. The building was drafty, and mouse droppings were visible everywhere, even inside the sugar-boiling pots.

Wen Tong knew that even modernized sugar factories weren't perfectly clean, but the current state of this place was truly dismal. It seemed starting a business here would be a difficult endeavor indeed.

Seeing Manager Wen's furrowed brow, his entourage knew he was displeased but couldn't understand why. The sugar mills throughout Leizhou Prefecture were all more or less the same. What was it that he found so dissatisfying?

Leaving the pressing shed, he found a clean stone to sit on in the yard. Just as he was about to sit, a young man in a blue tunic and a small cap scurried over, carrying a folding chair, which he quickly opened and placed under him.

"Please have a seat, Master," the young man said softly, his head bowed.

Wen Tong was startled. Locals who could speak Mandarin were rare. "Who are you?"

Liao Dahua, the manager of the Qiwei branch, hurried over to explain, "This is Wen Xiu. He was sent from Guangzhou by Patron Guo specifically to serve you, Manager."

"Wen Xiu? What a girlish name," Wen Tong commented casually.

The servant boy's face immediately flushed, and he stood with his hands clasped, silent.

"Is this a 'trap'?" Chang Shide remarked, sizing him up. The boy looked to be about sixteen or seventeen, with fair skin, red lips, white teeth, and delicate features, giving him a somewhat feminine appearance. Chang Shide noticed his hat was rather peculiar, like a small skullcap but much larger. "Has the fashion of the Manchu dynasty already reached this far south?"

"What kind of hat is that?"

"It's a 'six harmonies' cap," Liao Dahua quickly explained. "It was designed by the founding emperor of our dynasty—"

"What? The skullcap was invented by Zhu Yuanzhang?" Chang Shide muttered, utterly surprised. He had always thought this particular headwear, a perfect match for the queue hairstyle, was an innovation of the great Qing Dynasty.

Hearing him openly say the emperor's name, both Liao Dahua and Wen Xiu, who understood Mandarin, turned pale. Liao Dahua quickly said, "Master Chang, be careful! That is the name of our founding emperor; it shouldn't be spoken so casually—"

"So I've heard. I'm not entirely clear on the details. Yu E'shui mentioned it once," Wen Tong said, then suddenly noticed something. "Why haven't you brought a chair for Master Chang?"

For the sake of convenience, Chang Shide's official title was Wen Tong's "Master Advisor," to avoid confusion among the locals about who was in charge.

"Master Chang's chair is being brought by Wen Qing. I'll go check on it now," Wen Xiu replied. He had initially been inclined to ignore this dark-faced, stubbled, crew-cut man, whom he'd mistaken for a foreman Wen Tong had brought along. In this era, dark skin was often seen as a sign of being lower class, something Chang Shide had experienced many times in Lingao.

A moment later, Wen Xiu returned with another young man. Besides a stool, they brought a tray with two cups of tea.

Chang Shide settled comfortably into his seat, took a pleasant sip of tea, and suddenly said to Wen Tong, "It seems coming out here is pretty great after all. This is the life! I wonder if there are any maids?" He glanced around expectantly.

"Reporting to the Master Advisor, there are no maids. We have only hired two servant women for cooking and laundry," Wen Qing replied respectfully.

"That Guo fellow really doesn't know how to do things. How can we manage without maids—" As he spoke, he noticed the two young servants covering their mouths to stifle their laughter and realized his words had been careless, damaging his image.

Wen Tong, however, had other things on his mind. He instructed Liao Dahua to send people to find the former workers of the sugar mill. If they were willing to return, they would be welcomed back with better pay. Liao Dahua agreed and sent his men out.

With the two groups of men gone, Wen Tong and Chang Shide sat facing each other under the 17th-century sky, the breeze carrying the faint, sweet, and rotten smell of cow dung, sugarcane, and sugar. They drank their tea, surrounded by more than a dozen men standing in silent, breathless attention. It made the two of them a bit uncomfortable. Eventually, they managed to persuade Liao Dahua to sit as well, but the others remained standing.

"I was a little scared when they told me I was being sent on a business trip," Chang Shide's eyes gleamed. "I always thought it was safest to stay in Lingao. I never expected to come out here and live like a big landlord. If I'd known, I would have applied to be an intelligence agent or something. That fellow Guo Yi has probably already taken a few concubines, or at least four or five serving girls!"

"You could get one too, you know," Wen Tong said, uninterested in the topic. He was preoccupied with the weight of his responsibilities.

An hour later, both groups of men returned. Three of the former mill workers had come back. Through a translator, Wen Tong learned that none of them were skilled technicians. According to them, the mill required five workers: a sugar master, a cane presser, an ox handler, a stoker, and a general laborer. The family that originally owned the plantation had handled the sugar boiling and cane pressing themselves.

"If the owner wants to make sugar, you must hire a good sugar master to lead the work," the man who had been the stoker reported. "Otherwise, it's hard to control the fire, and you won't know how much lime to add. It makes a big difference in the sugar yield."

Wen Tong nodded. He asked them about the entire production process and if they could demonstrate it on the spot. The stoker said they could, but since none of them were sugar masters, the resulting sugar might not be usable.

"Just tell them to do it," Wen Tong instructed the translator. "Don't worry about the quality of the sugar."

The three men conferred for a moment, then got to work. They enlisted two of the escorts to help, brought an ox from the pen, and carried over a few bundles of sugarcane. Knowing that Manager Wen found the mill dirty, Liao Dahua quickly had his men clean the entire place and wash the equipment before they began.

First, the workers stripped the sugarcane clean and tied it into bundles, placing them next to the wooden roller press. The rollers were made of lychee wood, which was incredibly hard. One person fed the cane into the rollers while another drove the ox to turn the press. The first roller, driven by the ox, turned the second via wooden gears. The cane was squeezed between the rollers three times to extract the juice.

On the third pass, the workers had to adjust the rollers to be even tighter, ensuring the bagasse was pressed as dry as possible. The extracted juice flowed down a groove in the base of the press and was channeled through a bamboo pipe into a large earthenware jar to settle.

Wen Tong watched closely. The pressure from the wooden rollers seemed significant, but it was actually less effective than the Qing dynasty presses he had seen, which were at least made of stone and thus much harder. He squeezed a handful of the bagasse—even after three pressings, a considerable amount of juice remained.

After about forty minutes of pressing, the ox was covered in sweat and its pace had slowed. The work was clearly exhausting. As the workers began to switch the ox, Wen Tong asked how much cane was processed in one go. They told him four bundles per pressing session. In a full day and night, the ox would need to be changed thirty to thirty-five times. No wonder the mill kept four or five oxen.

He had someone weigh a bundle of cane and did a quick mental calculation. With this method, working non-stop for a day and night, they could only process about 2000 kilograms of sugarcane. Furthermore, the workers mentioned that the wooden rollers often broke down, requiring them to stop for repairs, which wasted a lot of time.

"Are there any presses made of stone?" Wen Tong asked.

The workers all said they had never seen one. Among the thirty to fifty mills in the area, they had never heard of one using stone.

Wen Tong nodded. It seemed this technological improvement appeared during the Qing dynasty. A stone roller press could process 2500 kilograms per day, a significant increase in efficiency.

After the initial settling, the sugarcane juice was skimmed of debris and poured into large iron pots arranged in a triangle. Wen Tong couldn't see any practical advantage to this arrangement in terms of production or efficiency, speculating that perhaps it was a way to concentrate the heat.

As the juice was boiled into a syrup, just before it reached a full boil, the worker who had been the stoker used a large ladle to skim off the foam and impurities from the surface. Then, he took some lime from a bag, wrapped it in a sugarcane leaf, and sprinkled it into the pot.

"Lime?" Chang Shide was surprised.

"It's used to clarify the sugar solution," Wen Tong explained. To remove impurities from the cane juice and obtain cleaner crystals, a crucial step after filtration is to add a clarifying agent. Modern sugar factories often use lime, and it was naturally the easiest to obtain in ancient times compared to alternatives like sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, or superphosphate. Some places used plant ash for the same purpose.

"But doesn't the lime dissolve into the sugar water? Does that mean white sugar contains lime?"

"No, it actually neutralizes and breaks down the various impurities in the cane juice," Wen Tong patiently explained. "Whether it's white sugar or brown sugar, there's not a trace of lime in it."

"That's a relief."

The juice had now turned yellow. The workers moved the pot's contents to the second pot to slowly evaporate the water, while repeating the process in the first pot.

Then, the more concentrated juice was moved to the third pot, and some oil was added. Wen Tong asked, "What are you adding?"

"It's peanut oil," a worker replied.

"Peanut oil?" Wen Tong was puzzled. He recalled from his reading that the earliest method for decolorizing sugar involved adding milk, while the Chinese method used chicken or duck egg whites. The principle was to use protein to remove impurities. Was oil a protein?

Puzzled but curious, he decided to keep watching. Once the cane liquid had been cooked into a thick paste, it was poured into "earthen funnels." Wen Tong had seen Qing-dynasty examples of these, and the ones here looked almost identical: conical, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, about a foot high, with a small hole at the tip plugged with straw. They were placed over large earthenware jars to allow the sugar to crystallize slowly. The molasses, containing most of the impurities, would drip out through the straw at the bottom, leaving behind the purer sugar crystals in the funnel. Wen Tong asked and learned that one funnel could produce about 10 kilograms of brown sugar.
