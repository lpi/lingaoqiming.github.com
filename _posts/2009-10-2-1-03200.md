"Sleep," [Director Wen][y002] thought, the words surfacing from the depths of a dream, "is the shore of death." He opened his eyes to a canopy of pale red gauze, its water-grass pattern swaying gently above him. A subtle, pleasing fragrance filled the air. He inhaled, savoring the scent, and then his eyes flew open, wide with alarm. This was not his room.

Had he not already tumbled through a wormhole, he might have believed he’d been thrown across worlds once more. The fog in his mind began to lift. He was supposed to be in the lodging provided by Gao Ju, under a canopy of plain blue cloth. This fragrant, silken prison was something else entirely. Where in God's name was he?

He pushed himself up, a wave of dizziness washing over him. His head throbbed, his limbs heavy and useless. The room was a cage—small, windowless, furnished only with the large bed he occupied, a small table, and a single chair. A vase and a meticulously pruned bonsai sat on the table, while two landscape scrolls adorned the walls, mocking him with their placid scenery.

He stumbled to his feet and dressed, a cold dread creeping into his heart as he realized his gear was gone. The anti-stab vest, the utility belt, the waterproof boots—all vanished. His talismans—the large folding knife, the stun gun, the pepper spray—had been taken. For a man who lived by the creed of survival, he was now utterly defenseless. Panic, cold and sharp, pierced through his confusion.

The door creaked open, admitting a lean man of medium height. His face was a mask of feral intensity. [Wen Desi][y002], a seasoned judge of character, knew instantly this was no friend. He held his tongue, waiting.

"Shopkeeper Wen," the man said, his bow a careless gesture that just so happened to reveal the hilt of a short sword at his waist. His accent carried the distinct cadence of Southern Fujian.

"And you are?"

The man chuckled, a dry, rasping sound, and seated himself in the lone chair with an air of unearned familiarity. "We are men of the sea, just like you. Word has reached us that a 'Shopkeeper Wen' has arrived from Australia, his holds laden with strange and valuable goods. We were hoping you might share the location of your vessel, your shipping lanes. It is always wise for brothers of the coast to watch each other's backs."

[Wen Desi][y002] remained silent, his mind racing. "What is this place?" he asked instead.

The man laughed. "A temporary courtesy, Shopkeeper. No need for details. We are more interested in Australia. We hope you will enlighten us," he finished, his voice hardening.

*This dried-up runt thinks he can intimidate me?* [Wen Desi][y002] seethed internally. Ordinarily, his fists would have answered, but his body was a leaden weight. A wise man knows when to fold. He had no choice but to play along.

"Very well. What do you wish to know?"

"Your vessel. What kind of ship brought you to the Great Ming, and where is she anchored?"

This was the question he had dreaded. The truth was impossible; a lie would be difficult to sustain. With no Australian ship to point to, he had to borrow one.

"Our Australian ships are not built for such long voyages. We sail them only as far as Borneo. From there, we charter passage on Portuguese vessels." It was a plausible blend of fact and fiction, difficult to disprove. The man, Boss Wang, seemed to accept it and pressed on, asking how they had managed to enter Guangzhou.

[Wen Desi][y002]'s mind worked furiously. These kidnappers were clearly not aligned with Gao Ju; they might even be his rivals. He would weave a tale that implicated Gao Ju in every verifiable detail, making it impossible for them to unravel his lies. He recalled what [Xiao Zishan][y001] had told him about the smugglers of Haopan Street.

"In Australia," he began, "we heard tales from foreign merchants of the riches of Guangzhou, a city closed to outsiders. By chance, a Portuguese sailor told us of a place called Youyu Island, at the mouth of the Pearl River, a haven for those who wish to trade quietly. We disembarked there and paid a man to guide us into the city. He brought us to the residence of Gao Ju."

"Oh? And this man's name?"

"We were new to these shores and did not dare ask too many questions. I believe his name was Wang."

Boss Wang of Youyu Island. He had plucked the name from a stray comment made by one of Gao's servants.

"How curious. Because Boss Wang says he knows no Australian sea merchants," a clear, melodious female voice drifted from the doorway.

A young woman emerged from the shadows. She was dressed in a close-fitting, lotus-root colored jacket and a long, finely pleated skirt of snow-blue. She was tall and slender, with arched brows, crimson lips, and skin like polished jade. Her eyes were large and luminous, dancing with a natural charm as she spoke, yet a closer look revealed a glint of steel beneath their surface.

The man, Boss Wang, seemed to shrink in her presence. He rose at once, an obsequious smile plastered on his face, and offered her the chair. She took it without a word of thanks, her movements a study in fluid grace. Her eyes, large and unnervingly perceptive, swept over [Wen Desi][y002], and his heart hammered against his ribs. *Who is this woman?* he thought. She was an anomaly, a creature of impossible poise and danger for this or any century.

"And you are?" [Wen Desi][y002] asked, his voice steady despite the unease coiling in his gut. Her words had cornered him. To argue would be to reveal his deception. He needed to buy time.

"Hush, Boss Wang," she chided gently. "There is no need for such hostility. I am no brigand. My name is known and respected on these waters. There is no need for secrets. I am Li Siya." She rose, gathered the hem of her skirt in one hand, and executed a perfect curtsy. The gesture sent a jolt through [Wen Desi][y002]. A curtsy? Here? *Could she be... like us?* The thought was staggering. *Are there others?*

He forced himself to his feet and managed a slight bow. "I am [Wen Desi][y002]."

A flicker of surprise crossed Li Siya's face. "You follow Western customs in Australia?"

Then he looked closer, and the pieces began to fall into place. Her hair, catching the lamplight, was a shade of light brown, her eyes the same. A subtle wave ran through her long tresses. She had foreign blood—Portuguese, most likely. Macau was filled with such faces, the children of two worlds. The curtsy was simply a flourish of Western courtliness. His racing mind calmed. He offered a slight smile.

"It is the custom in Australia, yes."

"And you still claim to be children of Huaxia? Has your culture collapsed so completely?" she teased.

"A man's heart determines his home," [Wen Desi][y002] countered smoothly. "Ours lie with Huaxia. Rites and music are but the clothes a culture wears."

"Well said," Li Siya replied, settling back into her chair. She casually produced a small knife and began toying with it. [Wen Desi][y002]'s blood ran cold. It was his. "But you evade my question, Shopkeeper Wen. Boss Wang claims to have never met you." Her voice was a silken thread, but her eyes held a chilling boredom. She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "You do seem quite attached to your... manhood. It would be a shame to see it... altered."

A cold sweat broke out on his brow. Her words were honeyed, but her soul was poison. This woman was a predator. Cowering would invite her contempt; defiance would invite her wrath. He steadied himself. *I said his name was* likely *Wang. A common enough name.* [Xiao Zishan][y001] had told him how insular these smuggling clans were. They wouldn't speak to an outsider like her. He felt a surge of confidence. *She's bluffing.*

"I know no 'Boss Wang.' I only said the man's name seemed to be Wang." He softened his tone with a placating smile. "We are simple merchants from overseas, interested only in trade. We do not pry into the affairs of others."

"You people and your obsession with silver."

"It is the nature of a merchant to seek profit," he replied.

"And yet, I sense you and your men are no ordinary merchants." Li Siya leaned closer, the scent of rosewater reaching him. "Seeking profit? Is there anyone in this world who does not? Even the Son of Heaven seeks only to profit his own house, his own name." Her gaze was sharp, pinning him in place. "Am I wrong, Shopkeeper Wen?"

"Miss Li's wisdom is profound." The suspicion returned, stronger this time. Was she truly from this era? Her manner, her speech—it was all subtly wrong. An unsettling thought crossed his mind, a strange premonition of a different kind of danger she might represent. He pushed it aside as she sat up, arranging a collection of items on the table before him. They were a bizarre assortment: [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s socks, [Engineer Wang][y003]'s ballpoint pen. The only thing they had in common was that they did not belong in this century.

"All of these are from Australia?"

"They are."

With a delicate gesture, she used a bamboo stick to lift one of [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s nylon socks. "This stocking... how is it woven? And the thread, how is it spun? So fine, so transparent, yet it stretches."

"[Wen Desi][y002] knew his textiles. "It is a knitted stocking, made by a machine." The first hand-cranked knitting machine had been invented in England only thirty years prior. It was a primitive device, and it was unlikely the Portuguese had yet learned of it.

"A machine?" she mused, her eyes fixed on the sock.

"Yes."

"And the thread? Silk does not have such elasticity."

This was a more difficult question. He could explain a knitting machine, but revealing that the thread was a byproduct of petroleum would likely have... unfortunate consequences for his anatomy.

"The material is called nylon, not silk. Its creation is a state secret of our nation. A humble merchant like myself would not be privy to such things."

Li Siya nodded, a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. A strange thought surfaced in [Wen Desi][y002]'s mind. It seemed a cosmic injustice that legs as long and slender as hers were not sheathed in fine nylon. Perhaps a new item should be added to their import manifest...

"It seems your Australian script is also of the Western style. This pen requires no inkstone. Most convenient." Li Siya sighed, turning the pen over in her fingers, clearly fascinated. "Your wares make me feel like a frog in a well. I never imagined such a place existed, capable of creating such marvels."

"You are too kind."

"Now that you have opened this route, I trust you will be trading here for many years to come?"

"Well..." [Wen Desi][y002] hesitated, unsure how to respond.

"No matter," she said, a cold, self-satisfied smile playing on her lips. It was as if she were speaking to herself. "These waters will belong to the Big Boss, sooner or later. All of them. If you wish to sail them safely, Shopkeeper Wen, you would be wise to remember that." She stood, her point made, and swept from the room, leaving him in a silence more menacing than her words.
