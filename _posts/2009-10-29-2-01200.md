Guo Yi's spirits lifted. Xue Ziliang's theory, that they were all caught in an elaborate, cult-like fantasy, was a lifeline in the sea of absurdity. He pulled the American aside, eager for more details.

"Have you heard of the World Republic case?" Xue Ziliang asked.

"No."

"A man named Frotz-Boot, who claimed to be Hitler's illegitimate son, announced that a fleet of flying saucers from Venus would land at Berlin's Tempelhof Airport. The commander of the fleet would then declare him president of the World Republic. He genuinely believed it. He wasn't a con man; he was a true believer."

"So you think this is a foreign version of playing emperor?" Guo Yi yawned. He had read the case files of a dozen self-proclaimed "True Sons of Heaven" from the remote corners of China. It was a common enough delusion.

But it still didn't explain the loss of all signals. As his mind wrestled with the problem, the cabin door opened and someone tossed in three blankets.

"Get some rest," a young man's voice announced. "You're hitting the road tomorrow."

The phrase, "shàng lù," sent a chill down Guo Yi's spine. It was a term with a double meaning, a euphemism for death. He spent a sleepless night scribbling a last will and testament in his small notebook.

In Lingao county town, a deathly stillness had fallen. A curfew was in effect, the dark city walls looming like a shroud. Soldiers stood at the intersections, their faces grim in the flickering light of the lanterns. The town was swollen with refugees, their faces etched with a quiet, desperate fear. They huddled in the temples and on the stone-paved streets, their livestock a silent, anxious presence beside them.

The alarm had been raised at dawn, when the beacon fire at Bopu had been lit. Inspector Fu, the commander of the small garrison at the inspection office, had fled back to the town, his face a mask of terror.

"Do you think the pirates have retreated?" someone whispered in the shadows.

"It's hard to say. They usually just take what they can and leave."

"If they were gone, would the Magistrate still be sending for help? Master of Records Wu went to the Rear Post this afternoon to ask for reinforcements."

"Are they that powerful?" a farmer asked, his voice trembling.

"Powerful?" a small merchant scoffed. "The seas off Guangdong are a hornet's nest. Yang Er, Liu Xiang... the government can't touch them. They say the court is even considering offering them amnesty."

"If they get amnesty, things will be peaceful, right?"

"Peaceful? I doubt it. That Yang Er was granted amnesty once, and he still ended up preying on the common people."

"Will they attack the town?"

"The last time the town was besieged was thirty years ago, during the Li rebellion. My grandfather fought on the walls."

Their conversation was cut short by the appearance of the Master of Law, his face a thundercloud. "What nonsense are you barbarians talking about?" he roared. "If you keep spouting this seditious talk, I'll have you all flogged!"

A dozen unlucky souls had already been beaten or put in the cangue for speaking out of turn. The crowd fell silent.

In his flower hall, the Magistrate of Lingao County, Wu Mingjin, sat in quiet contemplation. He was a man of nearly fifty, his hair already graying. He was a provincial graduate, a man of letters who had been sent to this remote, desolate corner of the empire. He had tried to be a good official, to build waterworks and promote agriculture, but the years had been filled with disaster. The beacon fires were a constant, flickering reminder of the pirate menace that plagued the coast. Last autumn, a typhoon had ravaged the countryside, and the epidemic that followed had claimed countless lives.

He had at first dismissed the alarm from Bopu as another routine pirate raid. But the words of Fu Baiwen, who had fled back with his men, had filled him with a cold dread.

The pirates, he had said, had arrived on a "giant ship," its hull taller than the Great Accomplishment Hall of the Confucian Temple. Their ships moved without sails or oars, as if by magic. And they were made of iron.

An iron ship that could float on water... it was a thing of myth, a creature from a nightmare. He had sent a bailiff to investigate, a man of the Dan people who knew the Bopu area well. The man had returned, his face ashen, his words a jumble of terrified nonsense. The pirates, he had said, numbered over a thousand. They had vehicles that moved without horses or oxen, machines that could lift great iron boxes as if they were made of straw. They were not men, he had said. They were demons.

The Magistrate, a man of reason and learning, did not believe in demons. But he had seen the strange and ingenious things of the Portuguese in Guangdong. He knew that the world was larger and more complex than his classical education had led him to believe. And he knew that his small garrison of eighty militiamen and a dozen archers was no match for such a force.

He had sent for reinforcements. The Commander of a Thousand at the Rear Post had agreed to send thirty men and a cannon, for a price. They would arrive in the morning. For now, all he could do was wait, and pray.
