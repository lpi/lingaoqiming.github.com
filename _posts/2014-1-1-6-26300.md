After finishing her shopping, she would, as usual, go to the second floor of Number 43 for a break. The second floor of Number 43 housed a small, elegantly decorated teahouse. Though not large, it faced the courtyard and had a pleasant atmosphere. This teahouse was specifically opened by Li Mei for the maids who came to shop.

The Elders were generally very busy, and with the exception of a few married female Elders and "dependent Elders," few had the leisure to shop in person. Housekeeping was mostly handled by their life secretaries, so the special supply store was almost exclusively frequented by maids.

Life secretaries, being human, naturally had social needs. The maids, when shopping at the special supply store, would naturally gather in these few places. However, the fresh food store had a poor environment, and while maids could use their masters' secondary cards at the farm teahouse, it was ultimately a place for Elders, and most maids felt uncomfortable going there alone. Thus, the Cooperative Number 43 store in East Gate Market became a place for maids to relax and socialize in their spare time. With her keen business sense, Li Mei had opened a teahouse here to earn more profit.

After shopping in East Gate Market, the maids would often rest here, have a cup of tea or a drink, and chat. Although it was never crowded, the sales were quite considerable.

The teahouse was empty. The morning was the busiest time for the maids, and only three or four tables were occupied. Sun Shangxiang glanced around. Although she didn't know anyone, most of the faces were familiar, and she nodded in greeting.

Every time she came shopping, she would sit in the teahouse. This was a "task" set by Cheng Yongxin. Sometimes, even if she didn't need to buy anything, she would come for a cup of tea. She came every two or three days, and chatting with people and listening to their conversations was the substance of her task.

She could hear a lot of news here. The maids, like all women, were keen on all sorts of gossip. Sun Shangxiang gradually discovered that although a maid was just a "concubine," she enjoyed many conveniences, and even power, in the Lingao regime.

Since the maids were often the Elders' first women in this time and space, even if their looks were not the best, they had shared hardships. The bond was unusual, and the spiritual and material rewards given to the maids were generous, so much so that [Wen Zong][y002] once complained loudly at a Standing Committee life meeting that "some Elders" were not enjoying "the service of maids" but seemed to be "in love" with them, "seriously corrupting the atmosphere."

In Lingao, anyone or anything connected to the "chiefs" was a cut above the rest. This was especially true for those who directly served the Elders in their daily lives and might even bear their children. The naturalized citizens, continuing their old ways of thinking, naturally held these maids in high regard.

This was not only due to traditional concepts but also for practical reasons. Because the maids lived right by the Elders, they had easier access to them than ordinary naturalized citizens. Some capable maids even acted as the Elders' secretaries in practice. The workings of social relationships have been the same since ancient times.

Those close to power would not be ignored, and naturally, all sorts of naturalized citizens and natives began to approach the maids with various motives.

Through them—if in the old time and space there was "secretary politics" and "wife politics," then Lingao inevitably saw the beginnings of "maid politics."

From project bidding and procurement to asking an Elder to write a few words, the maids faced all sorts of requests. Although most of the maids were orphans from outside with no relatives in the area, people still tried to get close to them, claim to be from the same hometown, form friendships, or become sworn relatives. As the saying goes, "Even in the deep mountains, the rich have distant relatives."

Many who hoped to climb the social ladder inquired about how to send their own daughters to be "maids" to the Elders. There had even been cases of people posing as office cadres and swindling money under the pretext of selecting "maids." In short, maids were no longer insignificant figures in Lingao's social ecosystem.

"Oolong tea," Sun Shangxiang ordered from the waitress with practiced ease after taking her seat. Drinking oolong tea was also a "suggestion" from Chief Cheng. For her, a daughter of a hereditary military officer from a poor coastal garrison in Shandong, drinking "sweet water" was already a great satisfaction. The coarse flower tea with more stems than leaves she bought was only for guests. She naturally had no particular taste for tea.

Along with the oolong tea came four small dishes of her favorite snacks: preserved plums, dried sweet potatoes, grilled fish fillets, and sunflower seeds.

As she drank her tea and nibbled on the snacks, she pricked up her ears, listening to the whispers in the air. Although it was in a bustling market, the teahouse was very quiet, and even deliberately lowered voices could be mostly understood. Even without talking to anyone, she could gather a lot of information from the unguarded conversations between the maids.

The chief attached great importance to the snippets of information she brought back. Every time she returned, she would give a special report, which the chief would record in detail in a notebook. Any news seemed to be important to her, even trivial household matters. Sometimes, the chief would give specific instructions, asking her to approach certain maids and inquire about specific news.

Recently, the news she had been collecting was all related to the Yang Jihong case, and this was what she was most concerned about.

But none of these maids were from the families of the chiefs in the Arbitration Court system. Sun Shangxiang was slightly disappointed, but she faintly heard someone mention the three words "Yang Jihong." The maid's voice was very soft, but the name "Yang Jihong" had been ringing in her ears so much lately that she was tired of it. Although Chief Cheng never mentioned the matter in front of her, she had been busy with this case recently, and it was also the content the chief had asked her to "focus on collecting."

Her attention immediately focused, but the following content had little to do with Yang Jihong's case. The maids were talking about the rumor of abolishing the maid school.

"...Tell me, why would they abolish the maid school? Where would the chiefs pick people from then?"

"The chiefs all have people around them now. Where would they put new ones? I think it's quite reliable."

"The maid school was specially set up for the Elders. The office has spent so much money on it, and there are still many girls selected from various places in the school. How could they just abolish it? I don't believe it."

"I heard them say it with my own ears, how could it be false?" said the maid who spoke of abolishing the school with confidence. "Don't you know who my chief is good friends with?"

"That's true."

"Your chief, too, is neither a wife nor a concubine, just messing around with a man like this."

"So what, the Australians are all like that."

"It's better to abolish the school, it would be cleaner."

"Yes, to prevent a few more little vixens from competing with you..."

The following topic was just banter, and Sun Shangxiang had no intention of listening further, but she realized that this news was very important to the chief. However, she didn't know which families these three maids belonged to. If the chief asked who said it, the importance of the news would be greatly diminished. She had to find out first.

"Abolish the maid school?" Cheng Yongxin was taken aback and immediately asked, "Who said that?"

"I don't know them. They are not maids who come to Number 43 often."

"Oh." Cheng Yongxin's face showed disappointment.

"But I found out," Sun Shangxiang said calmly, and she mentioned the names of the three maids' masters.

"One of them is from [Li Xiaolü's][y156] house?!" Cheng Yongxin's spirits immediately lifted when she heard the name "[Li Xiaolü][y156]."

"Yes, her name is Li Qiqi."

"Li Qiqi? What a rustic name. She probably hasn't changed her name yet," Cheng Yongxin said with a rare smile that had been absent for days. "How did you find out?"

"I waited until they paid and left, then I went to the waitress and said I found a handkerchief they had dropped. I asked who those maids were so I could return it to them in the dormitory area. The waitress told me everything."

"Well done!" Cheng Yongxin nodded in appreciation. For the past few days, she had been unable to get over the matter with Ji Xin, so frustrated that she wanted to smash things and hit people. On the premise of equal status, she had never lost a verbal battle, but she was actually rendered speechless by that old bachelor Ji Xin!

She didn't expect Sun Shangxiang to bring her such valuable news today!

There was no news of the abolition of the maid school in the Elders' circle, but Li Qiqi already knew about it. It was obvious that the matter had been discussed in the office, and maybe even the big shots in the Executive Committee knew about it. Cheng Yongxin felt that such a big matter could not have been decided yet. It was more likely that the high-level members of the Executive Committee were still in consultation. [Xiao Zishan][y001] had inadvertently mentioned it when he spent the night at [Li Xiaolü's][y156] house, and the maid happened to overhear it, so it became "the school will be abolished soon."

Judging from the source of the news, the authenticity of this news was over ninety percent.

"[Xiao Zishan][y001], you sly man, I didn't expect you to fall into a woman's hands after all. Hmph." Although Cheng Yongxin hadn't figured out how to use this matter yet, it was clear that there was much to be gained from it.

Sun Shangxiang saw the ever-changing expression on her chief's face, but her lips were upturned and her eyes showed joy. She knew the chief was very happy, and she felt very proud of herself.

"Shangxiang, you did well this time. I haven't doted on you for nothing!" Cheng Yongxin said with a smile.

"You're too kind, miss," Sun Shangxiang said with a curtsy. "It is my good fortune to be able to serve you."

"Go to the Lingao Times office now and find Chief Panpan," Cheng Yongxin instructed. "Ask her to help you check the archives in the Propaganda Department for any materials on these three maids and their masters, such as news reports, photos, and so on."

"Yes."

"Tell Chief Panpan to do it quietly and not let anyone know."

"Yes. I understand."

After Sun Shangxiang left, Cheng Yongxin opened the safe, took out her notebooks, and began to flip through them one by one.
