Ma Qianzhu asked, "Are there too many branches? How much manpower will this require!"

"Not many," Yan Ming said. "Our plan is to use local natives as much as possible, and only dispatch one or two people for activities, appearing only as merchants."

Of course, to set up branches deep in the heart of the Ming Dynasty would require a large amount of capital to operate, and the transmigrators did not have this strength at the moment. So the current plan was to open a bank in Guangzhou.

"New things are generally not easily accepted," Yan Ming explained his thinking. "At the beginning, it can be placed directly under the Guangzhou station system, and deposits can be absorbed through Zizhen斋 first—this one already has a relatively high credit, and it will be easier to attract deposits. It is estimated that it will not be long before Zichengji can also absorb deposits. The deposits absorbed by these two will be allocated and used by the Guangzhou Bank. The financial transactions and capital inflows and outflows of all the merchants under the Guangzhou station will also be handled by the bank in the future. We will slowly build up our credit."

In this way, it was equivalent to taking back the financial power of the Guangzhou station. The members of the Executive Committee were naturally aware of the benefits. The business of the Zi Corporation in Guangzhou was getting better and better, its business scope was expanding day by day, and there were more and more local merchants with whom they had dealings. Various financial problems were very prominent. Firstly, the Guangzhou station only had to fill out a fund request form and register the purpose of the expenditure to spend directly from Guangzhou's account. Secondly, the cash was completely self-collected and self-disbursed, lacking supervision. Although there was a quarterly financial audit, it was only to check the account inflows and outflows. As for various temporary expenses, it was simply impossible to verify them.

"Unsupervised power will inevitably lead to corruption." For the Executive Committee, the Guangzhou station was now a large state-owned enterprise lacking supervision. In the past, when the scale was small, a little bit of inflow and outflow was not a big deal, but now that the scale was getting larger and larger, they had to pay more attention to this aspect. If the four people at the Guangzhou station colluded to play tricks, it would be difficult for the Lingao Finance and Economics Committee to detect it.

Thinking of the increasing number of dispatched agencies in the future, the Guangzhou station was just one place now. In the future, when there were more places, wouldn't the situation become more and more chaotic? And once a chain of interests was formed in the embezzlement of public funds, it would be extremely complicated to clean it up. What if someone came to lobby the Executive Committee, or used inducements to buy votes among the masses... The thought of it could make the gentlemen of the Executive Committee sleepless.

Now that such a bank was established, all subordinate enterprises and affiliated enterprises had to open public accounts in the bank. Various special funds could also be set up with separate accounts. Every capital flow had to be recorded, avoiding the弊病 (malady) of a big pot of rice.

Thinking of it this way, opening a bank indeed had many benefits. Not to mention things like remittances, at least the internal control would be improved.

"Will this cause too much constraint on the enterprises? The person in charge might be timid."

"No," Cheng Dong explained. Establishing a bank and requiring all transactions to be recorded was only part of improving the financial system. It had nothing to do with who used the money or how much money was used, let alone interfering with specific operations.

"The financial power of the enterprises will remain autonomous. This will not change," Cheng Dong said.

"In that case, Lingao should also have a branch."

"Lingao now has Delong Grain Store to handle it. We can just add another branch to handle it concurrently. Including the various enterprises and institutions that have been established now, we must gradually establish a financial system, open public accounts, and strive to complete the comprehensive ticketing and institutionalization of financial work within the year."

Thus, the proposal to open a bank was passed. To avoid having too many brands that were difficult to manage, the one planned to be set up in Guangzhou was called Delong Bank. It would be directly under the command of the Finance and Economics Committee in terms of management.

"Is there a suitable person to dispatch?"

"Yes, Meng Xian is."

Everyone knew Meng Xian, but not for his financial talent, but for his impression as a shooting coach during the New Army training. They only remembered that he was an excellent shot, worthy of his background in sports school shooting.

"He studied finance and accounting in the United States. It's his field."

Wen Desi thought for a moment, "But this person's image is not very suitable."

This person was 180 cm tall, weighed 90 kg, had a full beard, curly hair, small eyes, and was muscular. Standing on the streets of Lingao, he was out of place with his surroundings. Wouldn't he be even more conspicuous if he were sent to Guangzhou?

"It doesn't matter. I think his appearance is very exotic. In a place like Guangzhou where people from all over the world gather, it's a good cover," Cheng Dong strongly recommended. "And he can also serve as a semi-agent. He has a lot of experience with firearms."

Such a conspicuous person, no matter how good his marksmanship was, could at most be an operative. He was obviously not suitable for intelligence work. But since Cheng Dong strongly recommended him, everyone no longer objected.

"Alright, this matter is settled."

As for the proposal to borrow funds at high interest in Guangzhou and invest them in the sugar market in Leizhou, the Executive Committee also approved it—although the risk was greater, it was a business that was sure to make a profit. They immediately telegraphed Guangzhou, authorizing the borrowing.

Upon receiving the news, Guangzhou immediately became busy. Everyone acted separately. Shen Fan was asked to step up the absorption of deposits, taking in as much as possible. Guo Yi and the others were busy with the borrowing. Guo Yi had already discussed it with Zhang Xin and Yan Maoda. Although there was no definite news from Lingao yet, the matter was urgent, and they had to act according to the circumstances. So they had already contacted all the families that might be able to lend funds. As soon as the approval telegram arrived, everyone immediately took action.

But things did not go as smoothly as expected. The reason was simple: the monsoon was coming, and the ocean-going ships would soon set sail. Large quantities of export goods required a large amount of silver. The money supply in the whole city was tight now. Even a big merchant like Gao Ju was short of cash. After negotiations, Gao Ju agreed that the amount of funds he could mobilize at any time was only thirty thousand taels, and this was after he had checked his accounts again and again and postponed a few payments. Guo Yi knew that for the matter in Leizhou, besides the fifty thousand that had been transported away, at least another one hundred and fifty thousand taels of silver were needed to secure victory.

One hundred and fifty thousand taels was not a big deal in Guangzhou in normal times, but now it was a case of a single penny being able to crush a hero. Although there was Shen Fan's method of absorbing deposits, it was a distant water that could not quench a nearby thirst. And Zichengji had always presented itself as a powerful and wealthy firm. If it appeared too anxious in borrowing, it would "lose face." After several months of mixing in the business world, the few people in Guangzhou had a good understanding of the traditional business circle—no matter what your real situation was, you had to have the necessary appearance, even if you had to borrow money to maintain it. Once you showed a slight sign of weakness, things would immediately become difficult.

However, if today's matter could be handled, there might be a big turnaround.

This sedan chair was specially ordered for him by Shen Fan recently, for him to use when visiting guests. Logically speaking, a commoner like him was not supposed to ride in a four-person sedan chair, but Guangzhou had been open for a long time, and it was common for people to use things beyond their status. Four-person sedan chairs were all over the street and were no longer a big deal. The only thing he restrained himself from was using green felt. The large sedan chair was very exquisite. All three sides were inlaid with glass windows transported from Lingao—transparent flat glass was quietly entering the lives of the rich merchants and gentry of Guangzhou. The window curtains were hung with colored silk, and the carrying poles were wrapped in copper, polished to a shine. In the sedan chair, there were covered bowls, fruits, snacks, and a water pipe. Everything was complete. If it was a long journey, there would be no boredom, and there were plenty of amusements. The inside of the sedan chair was very spacious, and there was more than enough room for two people.

Guo Yi was a little hesitant at first, feeling that this sedan chair was too ostentatious. But Shen Fan persuaded him that in the jewelry and curio business, if the owner was not extravagant, people would look down on his status, and the shop would also lose face. So a little luxury was appropriate.

Originally, Guo Yi wanted to propose that the vehicle manufacturing plant in Lingao produce a batch of high-end horse-drawn carriages for the Guangzhou market. But after seeing the price of horses in the Guangzhou market, he knew that this kind of product would be difficult to have a market—horses were surprisingly expensive. A few horse-drawn carriages could certainly be sold, but not many.

"A horse-drawn carriage, a horse-drawn carriage, it's no good without a horse—" Guo Yi pondered. His body swayed with the rhythm of the sedan chair. This was not the first time he had ridden in a sedan chair, and he was already used to the bumpy feeling. He was thinking about how to persuade these few patrons when he met them.

The amount of funds that could be borrowed in this piecemeal way would probably not exceed thirty thousand taels, which was still a hundred thousand short of the one hundred and fifty thousand. Where could he find this hundred thousand taels of silver? Guo Yi thought hard for a long time and discussed it with everyone, but no one could come up with a concrete idea.

However, if today's matter went smoothly, there might be a turnaround.

The sedan chair suddenly stopped. The attendant lifted the curtain and asked in a low voice, "Ziminglou is just ahead. Should we carry it in—"

"No need!" Guo Yi knew that this Ziminglou was now a first-class pleasure ground in Guangzhou, frequented by high officials and nobles. It would be too conspicuous to carry the sedan chair in. He was not here to show off.

"Go through the back door."

The back door was secluded, and there was also a special sedan chair hall. Guo Yi's sedan chair was carried directly in. The manager of Ziminglou was already waiting here.

"Have the guests arrived?" As soon as he got out of the sedan chair, this was his first question. It was clear that the owner attached great importance to this matter. The manager quickly replied, "Reporting to the owner, they haven't all arrived yet."

"Take me to see Miss—Pei." He hesitated a little when he used this address, but then he thought that since she had already appeared in women's clothes, he might as well acknowledge it to avoid any problems later.

PEPI's boudoir was located in a small courtyard in the back building. The courtyard was full of flowers and trees, a quiet place in the midst of the hustle and bustle. This was also the first time Guo Yi had come here. When he entered the room, he saw no maids, but a handsome young man came to greet him and help him change his clothes.

A year ago, Guo Yi would definitely have felt uncomfortable and would not have let others help him. But he had been in Guangzhou for a long time, and his cover was that of a big owner. His daily life was naturally different from that of ordinary people. As the saying goes, "a change of environment changes one's temperament." Following the old shopkeeper Shen, who was an expert in the business world, he had met many rich and noble people, and he had gradually developed the demeanor of a wealthy merchant. Even his Cantonese was slowly losing its 20th-century flavor, and he was beginning to blend into his role.

He calmly let the servant boy help him change into his home clothes and wiped his face with a hot towel. He sat down in the large room, and someone brought him tea and four plates of tea snacks.

Looking around, this room was also quite luxurious. The furniture was all made of Guangdong rosewood. This set of things, if it were in another time and space, would probably cost at least a hundred thousand. The four walls were hung with many famous calligraphy and paintings, probably all gifts. The most conspicuous thing was a large mahogany grandfather clock, which was the only one in Guangzhou. The "internal organs" of this large clock were all brought from another time and space, and only the outer shell was made by local craftsmen.

What was not so harmonious was the kerosene lamp on the table. Although it had a beautiful lampshade, its shape did not match the whole room at all. As for the row of rattan-cased thermos flasks on the Fujian lacquer low cabinet, it was even more anachronistic.

The servant boy went to the curtain and said softly, "Owner Guo has arrived."

PEPI, under the alias of Pei Lixiu, personally opened the curtain and walked out gracefully. These days, because she was in charge of Ziminglou and had many affairs, she had lost a lot of weight, which was more in line with the aesthetic taste of this time and space. Her face was lightly powdered, her eyebrows were like a painting, and her eyes flowed with a different kind of charm.

She came out and first curtsied. "Lixiu greets the owner."

This curtsy was a public acknowledgment that Guo Yi was her owner. Although it was an act, it was very necessary. Otherwise, a single woman with an unknown background opening such a large-scale restaurant would inevitably attract endless trouble.

The servant boys and maids, seeing that their master had arrived and would naturally have some private words to say, withdrew without being told.

Guo Yi was not polite and went straight to the point, whispering, "Who did you invite?"

"A few profligate young masters," seeing that there was no one around, PEPI dropped her graceful and charming demeanor and sat with her legs crossed. "I'm so tired!"

"Pay attention to your image!" Guo Yi, seeing PEPI's true colors, quickly reminded her.

"It's fine, I won't call them, they won't dare to come in!" PEPI stretched. "Do you have a cigarette?"

"Where am I going to find a cigarette for you? You have to be careful in this line of work. It's not good to have the smell of smoke on you—"

"Hmph, this line of work I'm in?" PEPI turned her back. "Ziminglou is a clean and respectable business. How could you say such hurtful things..."

Sweat, Guo Yi really couldn't take it anymore. He got goosebumps all over.

"Alright, I didn't say anything. I don't have any cigarettes. Let's get down to business."

"Hmm." PEPI took out a linen handkerchief and wiped her eyes. This handkerchief was a new product from the Lingao textile factory recently. It was made of a blend of local hemp and high-count long-staple cotton, which was light, breathable, and had a much better feel than silk.

All the luxury goods and consumer goods that were first developed in Lingao were mostly sent to Guangzhou first. Many of them were supplied to Ziminglou first to build up the brand. When the rich people liked it, the entire market would open up—no matter what era, the rich always led the fashion consumption trend.
