"Miss Cretia, you didn't leave?" Zhong Lishi asked.

Cretia wrapped her arms around Zhong Xiaoying's neck and said to them, "You should thank Xiaoying..." Zhong Xiaoying wiped her red, swollen eyes and broke into a smile through her tears.

"I must get to the bottom of what happened to Westerly. I've already spoken with my father, and he has agreed that I can stay here until he returns from Japan," Cretia said. "Please, let me help."

"Alright," Zhong Lishi nodded. He thought to himself that this was for the best. Having the victim's loved one as a witness would be more persuasive than his own unilateral investigation.

"Come, let's go home," Zhong Lishi said, then suddenly realized his slip of the tongue—they had a guest. He quickly corrected himself, "...Er, let's go back to the customs house." He then asked Cretia, "You should probably stay at the merchant's guild. You can continue to use the room there. We will cover the expenses."

"No, Doctor. I'll go back to the customs house to live—if you don't mind, I'd like to live with Xiaoying. I hope to learn Mandarin day and night," she said. "I wish to continue Westerly's studies and keep learning from you."

Dr. Zhong was deeply moved. The girl had never shown an interest in science before, and now this sudden desire was clearly to "carry on the legacy."

In any era or culture, people with strong will are always respected. Zhong Lishi couldn't help but feel a sense of reverence.

"Very well. I will certainly do my best to impart my knowledge to you."

"So, what do we do now?"

"Well... right now, we're going to do something very important for both life and science—eat breakfast."

On Jeju Island, Xue Ziliang received an order from Bei Wei: the entire detachment was to immediately relocate to Kaohsiung.

Although the order was just a single, simple sentence, the senators on Jeju Island all knew: the matter of dealing with Zheng Zhilong had been put on the agenda.

Kaohsiung already had one detachment: Qian Shuixie's. The Special Reconnaissance Team was the "sharpest sword of the Senate," and assigning one detachment to a single front was already a sign of importance. Now with two detachments, the purpose was self-evident.

Feng Zongze breathed a sigh of relief. Good, this meant the Senate's attention had shifted away from Jeju Island. Of course, Jeju's contribution of a large number of cattle and horses to the Senate was also a great merit. The cattle, in particular, had been shipped in large numbers to Hainan and Taiwan to support agricultural development. Although the horse population was still in the process of "inventory and recovery," the army's first light cavalry squadron for combat use had been formally established on Jeju Island. The first all-mule-and-horse-drawn artillery battery and the first horse artillery battery, which didn't need to use substitute animal labor, were also being formed.

Feng Zongze knew from his friends in Lingao that the Army was very satisfied with the work on Jeju Island. Dongmen Chuiyu, in particular, had praised the experience of forming the security forces on Jeju as "excellent" at a General Staff meeting. The small island of Jeju, with a local population of just over thirty thousand, had already contributed six hundred soldiers to the "White Horse" troops. Two companies of them had already been shipped to Kaohsiung, where they undertook many simple but important auxiliary tasks: sentry duty, patrols, maintaining order, and even acting as laborers when necessary... becoming an important internal security force for the area. This greatly relieved the pressure on the Northern Expeditionary Force.

In addition to the points scored with the Army, the active efforts of the Guang-Lei faction, and the continuous research reports issued by Du Wen after her survey on Jeju, had also helped. These reports, published in either *The启明星 (Qǐmíngxīng - The Lodestar)* or the *Lingao Times*, gave him many opportunities to showcase the positive image of the Jeju Front Committee.

Here on Jeju Island, there was no sign of a counter-attack from the Joseon Dynasty. Xue Ziliang had led his detachment across the sea for several reconnaissance-in-force missions, the entire process being like a leisurely stroll. On the longest mission, Xue Ziliang, with about ten men, roamed over half of Jeolla Province for more than half a month, conducting mapping and reconnaissance of the coastal roads and docks. During this time, they killed several hundred Korean soldiers and civilians, from officials and yangban to soldiers and local militia, and captured several forts. This caused the entire Jeolla Province to go on high alert, yet the entire detachment returned to Jeju Island unscathed. Not only were there no casualties, but they barely used any ammunition.

This operation completely dispelled Feng Zongze's and others' worries about a Joseon counter-attack. Given the Joseon Dynasty's level of grassroots control and its tragic social and financial situation, it was hard to imagine them being able to gather enough troops for a counter-offensive and sustain the campaign.

All signs indicated that Feng Zongze, the administrative chief of Jeju Island, had weathered the current crisis. To gain further support from the Senate, he collaborated with Zhu Mingxia to secretly select suitable women from the Korean populace on Jeju, according to the maid rating standards set by the General Office, preparing to send them to the maid school.

Although few Korean women on Jeju Island would catch the eyes of the senators, there was a base population of tens of thousands. Besides, they had a certain exotic charm—some senators had a taste for that. Even if only a few could be selected in the end, it would fully demonstrate that an overseas official like him was "always thinking of what the senators think."

The Jeju Front Committee held a banquet on Jeju to bid farewell to Xue Ziliang. After the lively party, Xue Ziliang took his detachment and equipment and relocated to Kaohsiung aboard an H800 transport ship.

As soon as he disembarked, before he could even warm his seat, he received a second order: "Rest for three days. The detachment is to immediately begin training in island landing and urban assault tactics."

This order was too obvious. Xue Ziliang thought to himself, this is clearly a setup to take down Zheng Zhilong.

Although, in formal procedure, a unit commander had no right to question specific strategic decisions, he and Qian Shuixie had a full exchange of views at Fengshan Fortress—the Army's base in Kaohsiung, where the Special Reconnaissance Team headquarters was located at the foot of Fengshan.

"It's no secret among the senators in Kaohsiung," Qian Shuixie said. "The Senate indeed has this intention."

Xue Ziliang was somewhat curious. "Why the sudden thought to attack Zheng Zhilong? Haven't we been passing through the Taiwan Strait without incident for a long time?"

Qian Shuixie chuckled. "You don't know about the 'Sarajevo Incident' from a few days ago, do you?"

Xue Ziliang asked with curiosity, "What incident?"

So Qian Shuixie recounted the murder of Westerly in detail. Xue Ziliang shook his head repeatedly as he listened. "They're asking for death!"

"Exactly," Qian Shuixie said. "Although the matter hasn't been thoroughly investigated, it's obvious that Old Zheng sent people to do it. Originally, it wasn't a big deal; just a Dutch boy died. Besides, it doesn't matter if the Dutch believe we killed him or not—unless they don't want to do business with us anymore. But the folks in the Senate feel they've always been wise and mighty, and they can't swallow this insult. This time, even if they don't finish off Old Zheng, he's in for a world of hurt."

He then added his own opinion: "I think this piece of meat is ripe for the eating."

Xue Ziliang let out a soft whistle. "Looks like we're going to be busy soon."

At that moment, Xu Ke was racking his brains. To investigate further, he had to go deep into Jinjiang County to find Lin Shimao—this was the only lead they currently had.

But landing on the mainland and going deep inland was easier said than done. Zheng Zhilong's stronghold, Anping, was within Jinjiang County. Jinjiang was essentially Zheng Zhilong's heartland.

An outsider like him, with his strange accent, would be reported to Zheng Zhilong the moment he showed his face in Jinjiang—that would be walking right into the lion's den.

They didn't even know where Lin Shimao's gambling den was. They only knew from Li Shun's confession that it was outside the northern gate of the county town. A den like that had no sign and no obvious storefront; without an acquaintance to lead the way, they would probably never find the door. Of course, this could be solved by using the Intelligence Bureau's network in Quanzhou and other places: the Shanhai Lianglu system's contacts could provide the necessary intelligence support, and finding the specific address and the person's movements would not be a problem. But to "thoroughly uncover the truth," they had to meet Lin Shimao and get a confession from him.

After much thought, the only way was for the Special Reconnaissance Team to perform another "snatch-and-grab," go to Jinjiang County, and directly abduct Boss Lin Shimao to Kaohsiung for interrogation.

Xu Ke immediately sent a telegram to Lingao, reporting his idea to Jiang Shan. Soon, Jiang Shan replied, agreeing to let him use the intelligence network to gather related information. Xu Ke then issued specific instructions to the Shanhai Lianglu intelligence network system in Quanzhou.

A few days later, a courier arrived in Kaohsiung from Quanzhou with a fishing boat, delivering detailed intelligence.

The Lin Shimao whom Xu Ke wanted to investigate was a local tyrant in Jinjiang—in modern terms, a triad boss. His main businesses were a gambling den and a pawnshop. The den was just outside the county's north gate. This man not only ran the casino but also kept a group of thugs, providing services for a fee. Whether the target was to be injured, maimed, or killed depended on how much the client was willing to pay. In addition, Lin Shimao's other main business was fencing stolen goods for pirates and selling various contraband, so he had deep connections with pirate merchants.

After Zheng Zhilong occupied Anping, Lin Shimao was not an official subordinate of the Zheng family, but more like a "kokujinshū" (local lord) from the Japanese Warring States period: he could maintain a certain degree of independence, but if his services were needed, he could absolutely not refuse.

However, in recent months, Lin Shimao had not had any contact with the Zheng family. He was basically engaged in his old trade: running the casino and fencing stolen goods. In the system the Zheng family was building, he was not only an outsider but also not particularly important.

Xu Ke thought: The Zheng family probably didn't contact him directly—people come and go in a casino, a letter could be delivered by just sending someone.

The intelligence agent also sent a detailed map of Jinjiang County, with the precise locations of Lin Shimao's residence, casino, and other "business establishments" marked on it. It also provided his daily routes and routines. Xu Ke felt this was enough to implement the kidnapping plan.

But he was also a little worried. Since Lin Shimao had long been connected with the Zheng family, would his sudden disappearance at this juncture arouse their suspicion?

On second thought, whether the Zheng family became suspicious or not, their fate was already sealed. Thinking this, he called out, "Prepare a car, I'm going to Fengshan Fortress!"
