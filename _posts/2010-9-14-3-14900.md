When Li Luoyou returned to his branch that day, Manager Cheng brought him an invitation.

"Baihu Lin invites you to a small banquet tomorrow."

The invitation specified "family banquet," meaning no official formalities were required; it was a simple gathering. Li Luoyou was surprised. He had just seen Lin Ming. Why the sudden invitation?

"What's this about?" he asked Manager Cheng. The manager was well-connected locally and could usually find out some information.

"I hear his sister-in-law has recently arrived..."

"Nonsense," Li Luoyou said. "Are we to be the escorts for his wife's family?"

"No, I hear that the sister-in-law was escorted here by two medicine merchants. Baihu Lin probably wants to do them a favor, introduce them to some business as a way of thanks," Manager Cheng relayed the gossip he had picked up from the Baihu's servants. "I also hear that he has invited Manager Yang from the Yang Run Kai Tang and several other pharmacy owners."

"I see." Li Luoyou nodded. If that was the case, it would be simple enough. Whether buying or selling, doing them a small favor was no problem. And it was always good to make new friends.

"Reply to Master Lin and say I will be there."

The next day, all the guests, both main and accompanying, arrived for the banquet. When the head of the Jinyiwei garrison invited you, few dared to refuse. When Yang Shiyi saw his cousin and the "renowned doctor from Lin'gao" seated in the guests of honor's seats, his face changed. This puzzled Li Luoyou.

"Manager Yang, are you feeling unwell?"

"No, no," Yang Shiyi said, touching his face. He knew his expression must be unpleasant.

"Brother!" Yang Shixiang was also surprised to see his cousin.

"Fifth Brother," Yang Shiyi bowed in return, his bow much deeper than it had been a few days ago.

"What, do you two know each other?" Lin Ming asked, surprised.

"Indeed," Yang Shixiang replied calmly. "This is my cousin."

"Oh? I didn't expect you to have such a relative," Lin Ming said with a laugh. "I should have guessed. He is also named Yang and is in the medicine trade."

"Yes, yes, Shixiang and I are cousins. He is the fifth in our generation," Yang Shiyi said, sweat beading on his forehead. It seemed the Baihu had invited him specifically for their sake. *When did that little brat Fifth Brother get connected with the Jinyiwei?* he thought, panicking as he recalled his recent attitude towards his cousin.

"So you are close relatives," Lin Ming smiled. "As the elder brother, you should take good care of him."

"Yes, yes, we are family. I will naturally do my best," Yang Shiyi quickly replied.

Li Luoyou interjected, "A friend of Baihu Lin is a friend of ours. If there is anything we can do to help, please do not hesitate to ask." A nearby servant quickly handed over his name card.

"Manager Yang, you have met a great god of wealth today," Lin Ming said proudly. "This Manager Li is no ordinary person. He is a prominent figure in Guangzhou." He then proceeded to lavish praise on Li Luoyou.

Due to his work, Liu San didn't often read internal publications like the "Social Situation Report," but the name Li Luoyou was not unfamiliar. He had attended several joint meetings with the trade department regarding the procurement of medicines, and the intelligence department had mentioned that this man was the supplier of "Manchurian goods" in Southern China, virtually monopolizing the supply of ginseng and deer antler. He undoubtedly had close trade ties with the Later Jin.

"A pleasure to finally meet you!" they all said, exchanging polite pleasantries. But Liu San's gaze remained fixed on the "traitorous merchant." The man was about forty, with a long face, a short beard, and a slightly plump build. He looked like a shrewd merchant, but his deep-set eyes suggested he had seen much of the world.

This was a target worth noting. Liu San remembered the trade department mentioning the need to open trade routes with the Later Jin, to dump Lin'gao's expanding light industrial products and, in return, acquire much-needed horses and livestock. They also planned to insert intelligence agents through these trade channels to establish a network in Liaodong.

Since this Li Luoyou was in the business of Liaodong goods, he could be a useful connection.

They took their seats and raised their cups. As it was a small family banquet, the etiquette was relaxed, and everyone chatted freely. Yang Shiyi was sweating profusely, wondering about the true nature of his cousin's relationship with the Baihu. Had he spoken ill of him? He was both worried and relieved. Relieved that he hadn't outright rejected his cousin's request a few days ago, leaving some room for maneuver. Worried that his brother might hold a grudge over his reluctance to sell the ingredients and act as a distributor.

After three rounds of wine, the conversation turned to the main topic, initiated by Lin Ming.

"Manager Yang the Fifth," Lin Ming said, "what medicine have you and Doctor Liu come to Foshan to sell?"

"You flatter us, Shi Weng,"—Lin Ming's style name was "Xinshi," and to show familiarity, they addressed each other by their style names—Yang Shiyi bowed and said, "These are two patent medicines for treating summer heat and evil influences."

"So I've heard," Lin Ming said, not just being polite. "Doctor Liu used this very medicine to save a beggar in the courtyard of the Yang Run Kai Tang, didn't he?"

"Indeed," Liu San replied, thinking, *The Jinyiwei's intelligence is truly impressive. They know about every squabble on the street.* "I used Zhuge's Marching Powder."

"Zhuge's Marching Powder?" Lin Ming said. "Is it a formula left by the Marquis of Wu?"

In this era, *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* was a household name, and Zhuge Liang's fame was widespread, giving the name a certain celebrity effect.

Liu San smiled. "It is based on an ancient and tested formula, with some modifications. The old formula claimed it was 'left by the Marquis of Wu,' and I simply took it at its word."

"I see. But the medicine is excellent and very useful," Lin Ming nodded repeatedly. The incident of Liu San saving the beggar had been reported to the Jinyiwei as a piece of local news that same day. He was very interested in this summer heat remedy. Although the Jinyiwei seemed powerful and could throw their weight around in Foshan, the nature of their work often required them to travel on official business. Many of his colleagues had died from seasonal illnesses or heatstroke on the road. If they had such a patent medicine to carry with them, he would surely win the praise of his superiors and colleagues.

How could Liu San and the others not see his intentions? Fortunately, Liu San had brought plenty of samples to promote the medicine. He distributed them to the guests at the table.

Li Luoyou asked, "Why are there two types? One is Plague-Averting Powder, and the other is Marquis Wu's Marching Powder. Aren't they both cooling medicines?"

Liu San smiled. "Actually, the Plague-Averting Powder is less effective than the Marching Powder. We've removed some of the expensive ingredients and added some cooling and aromatic herbs. Although it's less potent, it's cheaper and affordable for everyone. It's a way of doing good."

"I see." Li Luoyou nodded. He scooped out some of the "Plague-Averting Powder" with his fingernail and sniffed it. A cool scent shot through his nostrils, instantly clearing his head.

He then looked at the label on the back of the small porcelain bottle. It read, "Secretly prepared by the Runshi Tang of Lin'gao." Li Luoyou was stunned. This pharmacy was from Lin'gao?

Because of the Australians, he was sensitive to the name Lin'gao. He took a closer look at Manager Yang and Doctor Liu. Their dress and demeanor showed no flaws. Were they just ordinary merchants from Lin'gao? Manager Yang was one thing; he was of the same clan as Yang Shiyi. That left this Liu San.

"Doctor Liu," he asked tentatively, "do you have a pharmacy in Lin'gao?"

"Not at all," Liu San said frankly. "The Runshi Tang is Brother Shixiang's business. I only provided the formula."

"I see," Li Luoyou said. He had already concluded that this Liu San was one of the same group as the Master Guo he had met before. They all spoke Mandarin with a strange accent, and were definitely not from the Ming dynasty.

With a real, live Australian before him, Li Luoyou studied him closely. He suddenly realized that the man was not very old. Although he had a three-pronged beard, he was probably not yet thirty. He had a gentle face, a strong body, and bright eyes. His hands were dark and calloused, as if he had done some farm work. It was hard to figure out such a person.

However, his medicine was very useful. Li Luoyou, due to his trade in ginseng and deer antler, dealt with medicine merchants frequently and had some knowledge of pharmacology. Both of these medicines were good to have on hand during the summer. After the Dragon Boat Festival, the weather would get hotter each day, and it was the peak season for summer remedies. He decided to purchase a batch. It was a sure-fire profitable deal, and it would also earn him a favor from Baihu Lin.

"Manager Yang, I would like three thousand boxes of the Plague-Averting Powder and five hundred boxes of Zhuge's Marching Powder. When can you deliver?"

Neither Liu San nor Yang Shixiang had expected him to place an order on the spot. Yang Shixiang thought for a moment. "One month."

"Good, one month it is. Where shall I pick up the goods?"

Yang Shiyi quickly interjected, "The Runshi Tang's patent medicines are distributed by my Yang Run Kai Tang. Master Li, you can pick them up directly from our shop."

"Then I will trouble you, brother," Yang Shixiang said with a smile, bowing in thanks.

"We are brothers. It is as it should be," Yang Shiyi said, putting on a show of "brotherly unity."

After the banquet, Lin Ming was very pleased. Both Li Luoyou and Yang Shiyi had given him face, and he had received such a useful summer remedy. He ordered someone to have some custom boxes made, intending to use the medicine as gifts.

When Liu San and the others returned to their inn, Yang Shixiang was overjoyed. "I didn't expect Manager Yang to be so accommodating!" He glanced at Liu San. "Old Liu, I didn't know you had connections with the Jinyiwei."

Liu San, however, was unhappy. The Jinyiwei was the last group he wanted to get involved with. He had been foolish. Since Qianqian was a relative of the Jinyiwei, her "relatives" were likely of the same ilk. He had brought her here so carelessly. Fortunately, this Baihu Lin seemed to be an upright man, not some villain.
