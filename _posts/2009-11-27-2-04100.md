"Old Wu, you're here!" Zhou Dongtian, his work uniform stained with ink, greeted him. A former fire safety officer and judicial worker, his familiarity with printing had made him the head of the printing room.

"Publishing a newspaper?" Wu De asked, pointing to the proof sheet.

"Yes, the Executive Committee approved Ding Ding's proposal. It's just an irregular tabloid for now. We'll print fifty copies of the first issue."

"I don't think the positioning is right. Who is this for?"

"You think we don't know about Marx?"

"If it's for the locals, why use simplified characters? And has the Executive Committee considered the literacy rate?" Wu De thought it was a joke. Among the 138 captives he managed, only one could read and write. The illiteracy rate was over 95%. In such an environment, what was the point of a newspaper?

"We're about to start a literacy campaign for your labor teams," Zhou Dongtian said, pointing to a computer. "The Culture and Education Group has already drafted the first version of the literacy textbook. We're also planning to use lithography to make flashcards."

"They really are full of ideas."

"It's all Ding Ding's doing," Zhou Dongtian chuckled. "That reporter has big ambitions. Besides the newspaper, he wants to get into textbook publishing."

"Ideas are good. Anyway, here's my manuscript. Please print it for me as soon as you can."

"This little thing? I can just use the printer to cut a stencil for you. It'll just be a minute." He turned on the computer. Wu De's manuscript was already on the network, saving him the trouble of even typing it out.

"Since we have a computer network, why are we still printing documents? Such bureaucracy!" Wu De lamented.

"Probably to leave a paper trail for the archives. The computers will break down eventually." Zhou Dongtian adjusted the mimeograph machine. "In another ten years, we'll probably have to handwrite everything. I brought an old-fashioned Chinese typewriter, just in case."

After printing the materials, he left a copy for the intelligence archives and went to speak with the key leaders of the Executive Committee.

"You're saying the captives are restless?" [Wen Desi][y002] asked.

"Yes, and I'm afraid some will remain so." Wu De pointed to his report. "The small landowners, rich peasants, and middle peasants with their own property are agitated. The busy farming season is approaching, and they're worried about their families."

"There shouldn't be too many of them."

"True, but the tenant farmers have similar concerns. If they can't harvest their crops, they can't pay their rent."

"The only ones who seem content are the destitute with no family ties, or the long-term hired hands."

"So, not many are willing to join us," [Wen Desi][y002] said, discouraged.

"Correct. We are attractive to the poor, especially with the 'staff' benefits we're offering. But for those with a little property and family, it's a different story. They care more about a 'stable life.' They're the ones worried about 'how long the red flag will fly.'"

"Until we achieve a greater victory or some form of legitimacy, that concern won't go away," [Xiao Zishan][y001] added.

"Even so, we have to press on," [Wen Desi][y002] mused. "Remember our 'beacon effect.' As long as people see that serving us leads to a better life, they will naturally gravitate towards us."

"I agree. As long as we provide tangible benefits, the people won't forget."

"Also, what about the eight Li captives? What does the Executive Committee plan to do with them?"

"We're planning to use them to establish contact with the Li and Dong peoples to the south," [Xiao Zishan][y001] explained. "Mu Min is handling it."

The implication was clear: it wasn't Wu De's concern. He nodded. Just then, [Wen Desi][y002]'s phone rang. After a brief conversation, he said, "Have them wait. Treat them well. We'll be right there." He turned to Wu De. "We have some local visitors."

"Oh?"

"It's about the captives. You should come with us. And bring Xiong Buyou, and the local translator."

"Right, I'll see to it."

After the disastrous counterattack, a fresh wave of panic gripped Lingao. The returning militiamen spoke of the pirates' terrifying firearms. Even the renowned Huang Family Village militia had been crushed, and their leader, Huang Shoutong, was seriously wounded. Some of the gentry began moving their valuables and families to safety. Others fled home. Even the refugees who had sought shelter in the town now wanted to leave, fearing the short-haired pirates would come to sack the city in revenge.

After a few days, when it became clear the "Kun" bandits had no intention of attacking, the officials and gentry breathed a collective sigh of relief. But the heavy losses sparked internal squabbles. The failure of the supposedly perfect plan proved that Scholar Liu's strategy was useless. Rumors spread that he was an armchair general. The gossip infuriated the already frail Liu Dalin, who retired to his home to recuperate.

Magistrate Wu was furious but couldn't stop him. He spent his days sulking. It had been nearly a month since the pirates landed, and they showed no sign of leaving. The gentry had lost faith in him, and morale had collapsed. If the "Kun" bandits attacked now, the city would surely fall. And the prefectural government had sent nothing but a letter of useless platitudes and a reminder that the autumn grain tax was due.

"Collect grain, collect grain! Everything is a mess, what grain is there to collect!" Wu Mingjin fumed. He had no choice but to consult his private secretary, Wang Zhaomin, a man well-versed in local politics.

"Your Excellency," Secretary Wang said in a low voice, "since we cannot drive the bandits away, our only option is to negotiate."

"Negotiate?" The magistrate was so startled he almost jumped up.

"It is an expedient measure. The most pressing matter is the autumn grain. If we can just get this season's harvest collected, all will be peaceful. As for pirates, they are rampant in Fujian and Guangdong. Why not here?"

"Yes, yes, you are right," the magistrate said, relieved. "But I fear this cannot be hidden from my superiors, or from the secret police..."

"Your Excellency need not worry," Secretary Wang whispered. "In official matters, less is more. As long as the grain is in the granaries and the county seat is secure, why would the Prefect concern himself with this? The 'Kun' bandits could have taken the city long ago. Why build a camp at Bairen Beach? They haven't plundered or killed anyone; they seem quite benevolent. We can consider this buying peace."

"Reasonable, very reasonable," Wu Mingjin nodded. "But this is no small matterâ€”"

"Rest assured, Your Excellency," Secretary Wang said with confidence. "I suspect it is not we who are most anxious to negotiate, but the gentry."

And so it was. The gentry, worried about their harvests and with some of their own men missing, were eager to establish contact. A subtle hint from Secretary Wang was all it took.

They chose as their representative a down-on-his-luck landlord named Zhang Xingfu. His wife's family had a distant connection to the pirate leader Liu Xiang, which gave him some sway with the various groups active in the area. Though no one fully trusted him, they had no choice but to use him as an intermediary.

Accompanying him were stewards and distant relatives of the gentry, who were too afraid of being captured and held for ransom to go themselves. They came bearing gifts and formal calling cards, on which they humbly referred to themselves as "your students."

Less than an hour's walk from the county town, they saw the pirates' main camp. They knew the pirates had crushed the county's strongest militia in an instant, but the rumors of their good discipline offered a small measure of comfort.
