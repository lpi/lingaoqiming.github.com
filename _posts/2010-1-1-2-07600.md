The plan for Dongmen Market starts from the moat outside the East Gate of Bairen City, extending three hundred meters to the west, to build a main street—named Dongmen Street. On both sides of the street, a cross street will be built every one hundred meters, forming a layout of one vertical and two horizontal streets. Plots of different sizes will be marked out on both sides of the street, which can be sold to merchants to build their own shops. The transmigrators will also build some storefronts on both sides of Dongmen Street for merchants to rent and operate.

"Your plan is so big. Not to mention how many construction engineering resources it will take up, are there enough merchants in a place like Lingao to rent your storefronts? You can't expect vegetable peddlers to rent them, can you?"

"Lingao's economic scale is very small, basically a natural economy. Isn't this market a bit exaggerated?" Cheng Dong expressed his concern.

Dongmen Chuiyu was confident: "This is a long-term plan. We plan to start with the first phase of the project."

The first phase of the project includes the construction of a one-hundred-meter street with supporting sewers, and the construction of a mule and horse inn, a type of hotel commonly found on old official roads and in large markets. The inn has a large courtyard for tethering mules and horses and parking vehicles; a warehouse where merchants can temporarily store their goods; and a kitchen with convenient access to water and fire, but no meals are provided, so merchants have to cook for themselves. Accommodation is mainly in the form of common sleeping platforms, with some single rooms, a common lodging place for small and medium-sized traveling merchants.

A restaurant—he added that the transmigrators were having more and more interactions with the locals and needed a place outside the city to meet, talk, and eat. It could also serve wealthy merchants at other times.

Opposite the administration building, a commercial house will be built. The commercial house borrows some models from the British East India Company's factories: a building surrounded by high walls, containing a trading firm; warehouses and open spaces for storing and stacking goods; and guest rooms, restaurants, and meeting rooms for important merchants.

The original plan was to extend running water to Dongmen Market, but long-distance water supply was still difficult. Instead, they decided to dig several wells, one of which would be a public well, providing free drinking water for people and livestock. Finally, public toilets will also be built—the problem of locals doing business in Dongmen Market defecating and urinating anywhere has been a big headache for everyone these days.

Even the issue of greening was taken into consideration—it should be known that even Bairen City itself had no greening projects to date. Both sides of Dongmen Street will be planted with street trees, and the agricultural department will be asked to select the tree species. [Wu Nanhai][y009] immediately said he would look into it.

As for security, Dugu Qiuhun believed there was no need to worry. The main buildings of the market were of brick and stone construction, with iron-clad doors and windows. They even planned to build a watchtower at each of the four corners of the commercial house's surrounding wall. Even if someone were to attack, they wouldn't be able to break in for a while, and the blockhouses and watchtowers on the earthen ramparts of Bairen City were close at hand. As for public security issues like small-scale riots and robberies, he applied for ten sets each of anti-stab vests, anti-stab gloves, and batons, to form the "Dongmen Market Comprehensive Management and Law Enforcement Team" from the existing staff—"I guarantee that no one will be arrogant here," Dugu Qiuhun swore.

"You can have all of these," [Wen Desi][y002] said. "But what methods are you going to use to attract investment?"

"I'd like to explain the overall idea. It's quite large and complex. How about it?"

After getting everyone's permission, Dongmen Chuiyu picked up the folder on the table. This business plan was mainly devised by him in consultation with Yan Maoda and Zhang Xin. Yan Maoda was the manager of a jewelry company, currently in Guangzhou with [Xiao Zishan][y001]. Zhang Xin was the sales section chief of a small shipyard. When it came to business acumen, Dongmen Chuiyu had to admit defeat. However, neither of these two had ambitions in local commerce, so they didn't bother to compete with Dongmen, and their cooperation was quite pleasant.

The current prosperity of Dongmen Market is built on the foundation of the transmigrators' large-scale procurement. The huge consumption of more than five hundred high-consuming modern people has attracted many people to come here to do business and trade. However, the development of a market supported only by such large-scale group procurement is limited. How can they get people from the whole county, and even neighboring counties, to come here to do business and consume? The first solution they proposed was: build roads.

Bairen City is ideally located geographically. It is in the middle section of the road from the county town to the county's gateway port, Bopu Bay, and is centrally located on both banks of the Wenlan River, the most economically developed and populous area in the county. At present, the road from Bairen City to Bopu has been completed, and the extension to Lingao County Town is also under construction. Before long, the county town and Bopu Port will be fully connected. Not only will merchants from the mainland be able to reach the county town conveniently and quickly, but residents living on both banks of the Wenlan River will also be able to reach the county town conveniently and quickly via this road.

However, the road is located on the east side of the river, making it difficult for the people on the west side to enjoy the convenience of transportation. Dongmen Chuiyu proposed building a simple bridge upstream of the Bairen Hydropower Station to connect the north-south traffic. This way, the nearby common people would no longer need to make a detour to the Wenshui Bridge in front of the south gate of the county town to cross the river.

As long as there is a constant flow of people passing through Bairen City, the only market on the road—Dongmen Market—will become a distribution center for people and goods, and commerce will naturally prosper.

[Wen Desi][y002] expressed his approval of the proposal to build a bridge. Now that the industrial zone on the west side of the river had started construction, the transmigrators themselves found it very inconvenient for their personnel and materials to travel back and forth. Building a bridge was indeed a good thing that would kill two birds with one stone.

Dongmen Chuiyu said that the common people basically didn't dare to walk on the current road. With blockhouses and cars running on it, everyone was quite afraid.

"That's not a problem, it's easy to solve." [Wen Desi][y002] frowned. "But the common people in this time and space have no concept of traffic rules. Will our cars hit people when driving on the road?"

"No, we only have a few cars, and they don't go out unless it's something important. The fastest thing on the road now is a bicycle, and the biggest is a four-wheeled carriage. Safety is not a big issue."

The second solution is to attract foreign merchants. The commercial department has received a clear message from the intelligence and information group: Lingao is not a good market. Its economic structure is not only a natural economy, but a particularly backward one. Its total economic volume and purchasing power are not even comparable to the densely populated areas of the north, let alone the Jiangnan and Guangdong regions of the Ming Dynasty. The traditional get-rich-quick method for transmigrators—selling large quantities of "ingenious and obscene" modern goods such as mirrors, glass cups, and lighters—is not feasible here. The goods can only be sold on the mainland. The best situation is to have merchants come to purchase, rather than having to transport and sell the goods themselves.

Besides future industrial products, Lingao itself also has many local products for export. After consulting historical materials, it is known that the main export commodities from the local area during the Ming Dynasty were cattle, salt, red and white rattan, and betel nuts. Red and white rattan and betel nuts were mostly imported from the Li mountain areas, processed, and then exported to the mainland, making them the most profitable goods.

However, for a long time, apart from salt which was shipped for export from places like Bopu and Ma Niao in the county, most of the exported goods were transported to the prefectural city and exported from Shenying Port. If the export of goods could be shifted to Bopu, Dongmen Market, with its superior transportation conditions, would become a distribution center for mainland merchants to purchase local products.

"We can't control the betel nut trade now, but we have already controlled the production of salt. I suggest that the production and sale of salt be completely monopolized, making the salt shop in Dongmen Market the general wholesale store for Lingao salt, completely controlling the wholesale link of salt. Merchants who want to buy salt must come to Bairen City." Dongmen Chuiyu's eyes lit up as he spoke—monopoly, oh monopoly, how much money comes from you!

Other suggestions included exempting Bopu Port from "pumping water" (a form of tax) and mooring taxes to attract coastal trading ships to the port, and providing a good business environment, such as tax exemptions and warehousing and freight services. Dongmen Chuiyu even proposed using the Guangzhou base to launch a Hainan-Guangzhou commercial radio telegraph service to report the market conditions in Guangzhou and Macau daily.

With these benefits, mainland merchants would naturally move their procurement and processing centers for local products to Lingao. The subsequent influx of many permanent and migrant populations would have an obvious stimulating effect on the economy. In the future, after the transmigrators produce their own modern industrial products, they can use these channels to sell goods and purchase materials on the mainland, so as not to have to do everything themselves.

This business plan was approved. The construction engineering group complained endlessly. Their tasks were heavy: the road to the county town had just been completed; nearly two hundred households migrating from Damei Village needed resettlement housing; and many projects were still underway in Bairen City itself. Now there was another Dongmen Market development project. The brick and cement kilns were operating day and night, and there was a shortage of labor everywhere. [Ma Qianzhu][y005], who was in charge of overall coordination, was at his wit's end.

He then summoned [Wu Nanhai][y009] and said with a gloomy face, "[Nanhai][y009], your task has become heavier. From now on, you have to prepare meals for an additional eight hundred people every day—to supply the villagers who have migrated from Damei Village. The engineering projects are in urgent need of this labor force."

This notice made [Wu Nanhai][y009] gasp. He had at most provided meals for seven hundred people a day. Now, to suddenly add eight hundred people was a "Great Leap Forward" style satellite launch. Not to mention anything else, the kitchen equipment alone was not enough.

"The Planning Committee has just brought back a batch of spoils from Damei Village, all of them from the Gou family's kitchen and daily life. Go and pick what you need." [Ma Qianzhu][y005] sat behind a pear wood table, scribbled a note, stamped it with his private seal, and handed it to him—there were no official seals yet, so all documents were validated by the signatures and private seals of the Executive Committee members and professional group leaders.

"We won't have time to farm, we'll barely have time to cook!" [Wu Nanhai][y009] burst out, frustrated because he had been so busy being a cook lately that he hadn't had time for his beloved agriculture.

"As for people, you can pick whoever you want. Some of the women who have migrated from Damei Village can help. The main thing is that they must be reliable. Don't take anyone who has ties to the Gou family. By the way, our food cannot be handled by the locals. It's best to have separate cooking areas, understand?"

"How am I supposed to know who has ties to the Gou family?"

"The security group is conducting political background checks on them one by one. You can select a batch as soon as the materials are ready."
