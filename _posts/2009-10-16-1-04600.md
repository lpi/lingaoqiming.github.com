On the weed-strewn training ground, under the vast, indifferent sky, the transmigrators gathered for their first General Assembly. It would later be known as the "Training Ground Assembly," a foundational moment in their new history. Here, in the dying light of their old world, they would forge the laws of the new.

The debates that had raged for months on their private forums were now brought into the open. One by one, the core issues were discussed, revised, and put to a vote.

First, a series of definitions were established:

*   **Transmigrator:** Any resident of the 21st-century time-space participating in the temporal migration.
*   **Native:** Any inhabitant of the 17th-century time-space.

The principle was simplicity. The supreme authority of their new polity would be the **Transmigrator General Assembly**. It would elect the Executive Committee, formulate laws, and decide all major affairs of state. All transmigrators over the age of eighteen were automatically members, with the right to vote and be elected.

The **Transmigrator Administrative Executive Committee** would be their permanent administrative body, composed of full-time executive commissioners and the heads of the various professional departments: Industry, Agriculture, Commerce, Military, Internal Affairs, and a newly established Planning Commission to oversee the allocation of resources.

To address concerns about the concentration of power, a **Supervisory Commissioner** was added to the triumvirate of Chairman and Secretary-General.

The Assembly then voted to grant the Executive Committee **temporary emergency powers** for the first six months after the transmigration, a period of martial law to ensure their survival.

A **supply system for basic necessities** was established, guaranteeing food, clothing, and healthcare for all. The distribution of all other benefits would be handled through a **joint-stock system**.

All contributed equipment and funds were converted into **dividend-only shares**, distributed among the members. Every transmigrator, regardless of their contribution, received a baseline of **100,000 original shares**, a measure to ensure a basic level of security for all. A complex system of salaries, bonuses, and allowances was established, all calculated in a new internal currency: the **point coupon**.

Upon the death of a transmigrator, half of their shares would be passed on to a designated heir, the other half returned to the state.

The system, a curious hybrid of corporate structure and utopian idealism, was met with general satisfaction. Each member received a custom-printed stock certificate, a tangible symbol of their stake in this grand enterprise.

"Two hundred thousand shares," someone marveled. "I wonder what the dividend will be. Enough to support four or five wives, perhaps?"

"You lack ambition," [Wu Nanhai][y009] scoffed, tucking his certificate into its waterproof pouch. "I hope that after I die, my dozens of children will fight over my inheritance!" He gazed up at the 21st-century sky, his heart filled with the grand, improbable dreams of a new world.

The first Saturday after the Mid-Autumn Festival, Guo Yi was jolted awake by a call from his section chief.

"Little Guo, that Transmigration Company..."

"Yes! I've submitted the report."

"There's a problem. Get to the office in twenty minutes." The line went dead. "A problem," in their line of work, meant a very big problem.

He arrived in eighteen minutes. His section chief was there, along with a leader from the foreign affairs department and two foreignersâ€”a blonde, blue-eyed woman and a man who, despite his Chinese features, carried the unmistakable air of an American-born Chinese. They were, he knew instantly, law enforcement.

"Xue Ziliang, and his partner, Sarlina," his chief said. "Field agents from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Half a month ago, several Chinese nationals transported a large quantity of firearms and ammunition to Hawaii, chartered a yacht, and set sail for Vietnam. We suspect the weapons are on that boat."

"And they were in frequent contact with your Transmigration Company," his chief added.

Guo Yi's head swam. Smuggling weapons from the US to China? The implications were staggering.

The two American agents, he was told, would accompany him as observers. In the conference room, Xue Ziliang laid out the details. "Five Chinese men, two Chinese women, one Latina woman, and a young Chinese girl are on the boat." He handed Guo Yi a folder of photos and personal information.

"A family sailing trip," Xue Ziliang explained, "as a cover for smuggling." The group had purchased a massive quantity of SKS semi-automatic rifles and ammunition, far exceeding the needs of any enthusiast. "And one of them," he said, pointing to a photo of a square-faced man with graying hair, "is Lin Chuanqing. He's a known snakehead, familiar with the smuggling routes from the US to the South China Sea. With him at the helm, we have to question their true destination."

"And their contact in China?"

"We didn't know until we came to your department. The numbers they were calling belong to the Transmigration Company." He produced another file. "One of the men on the boat, Shi Niaoren, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases, returned to China seven months ago. He entered through Guangzhou."

Guo Yi's mind raced. He made a flurry of calls, his two American shadows watching with impassive patience. The news he received sent a chill down his spine. The Transmigration Company had terminated their lease two weeks ago. The base was empty.

Where had they gone? After a series of frantic inquiries, he learned that their vehicles had been tracked to a county on the Leizhou Peninsula, a county with a port.

A port. A rendezvous point. A ship. The pieces began to click into place. He remembered his reconnaissance of the base, the small boats in the harbor...

He picked up the phone and began to dial.
