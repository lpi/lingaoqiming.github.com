Not only was this conversation like a foreign language to Suo Pu, but even a military officer with limited education like Lin Ming was completely lost. Xie Peng only understood a little and certainly couldn't join in.

Seeing the three of them left out and feeling rather awkward, Mei Lun quickly said, "Let's discuss literature and poetry another day. We mustn't waste this beautiful scenery and fine moment. Come, come, let's play some drinking games to liven things up. Whether it's riddles or poetry, whoever gets it right will receive a tally stick. I have here a Duan inkstone, a gift from Governor Xiong. Although it's not from the old pits, it is still very precious. Whoever gets the most tally sticks will receive this as a gift." He clapped his hands, and a servant brought out a Duan inkstone and placed it on a high table in the middle of the room. It immediately drew everyone's attention.

Zhaoqing was the home of Duan inkstones. They had been designated as tribute items early in history, and the quarrying was always organized by the imperial court. Each pit was guarded by dedicated personnel, and private quarrying was strictly forbidden. During the Ming Dynasty, several quarrying operations were overseen by eunuchs sent from the palace, which shows how valuable they were. After Governor Xiong arrived, he ordered the reopening of the Shuǐyán pit at Lanke Mountain for "operational" purposes. Although this batch of Duan inkstones was "new," they were still extremely valuable to these poor scholars.

"Since there's a prize, we must set the rules," said a local scholar named Xie Shiming, who had always considered himself highly talented. After Xiong Wencan came to Zhaoqing, he had been hired as a secretary—not because of his great talent, but because he had grown up in Sichuan as a child and could not only speak relatively standard Mandarin but also converse in the Sichuan dialect, which soothed Xiong Wencan's homesickness.

He glanced at the inkstone and said with a serious expression, "Let's ask Master Chang to be the judge. Anyone who breaks the rules or gets the answer wrong will be penalized with a tally stick. The best answer will be decided by public consensus. How about it?"

Mr. Xianhe laughed. "Brother Xie, you're aiming to win this in one fell swoop."

Xie Shiming smiled arrogantly. "I wouldn't dare! I suggest we ask Master Mei to be the game master and give us the first topic."

Mei Lun knew that since Suo Pu and the others were from the Jinyiwei, they were unlikely to be very talented in literature. If they played a game involving couplets or poetry and they couldn't come up with a response, it would be embarrassing. He immediately smiled. "We are here to enjoy ourselves. Making it too difficult would spoil the fun. I think riddles will do just fine."

Xie Shiming said, "Master Mei's idea suits me well. I don't like composing poetry either. I struggled with a regulated verse for half the night yesterday, and I've had enough. Fortunately, there are many of us here. Those who want to compose poetry can compose poetry, and those who want to guess riddles can guess riddles. Since Master Mei is in high spirits, why don't you give us one to guess?"

Seeing no objection, Mei Lun was about to pose a riddle when Mr. Xianhe spoke up first. "I have an auspicious one for you all: 'Peace under heaven.' Guess a prefecture name."

Someone next to him said, "I've got it. Is it 'Pu'an'?"

Mr. Xianhe nodded. "Precisely." He then posed another riddle. "Here's another one: 'Green peaches in heaven are planted with dew, red apricots by the sun lean on clouds to grow.' Guess a flower name."

Mei Lun clapped his hands in admiration. "What a clean and magnificent topic! The answer must be a good one!"

Xie Shiming said, "I've got it. It's 'Lingxiaohua' (Trumpet Creeper)."

A scholar beside them said, "What a good riddle! Often, when making riddles about flower names, people only focus on the first few characters. They ignore the word 'flower.' For example, for the peony flower (mudan hua), the riddle is only about 'mudan,' not the 'hua' part. But this riddle focuses entirely on the word 'flower'."

Xie Shiming said nonchalantly, "That's nothing. Listen to mine: 'Treating the official world as a theater stage.' Guess a line from the *Analects*."

Chang Qingyun laughed. "That's a Four Books topic, the most common kind. I already know the answer. Nothing special."

Xie Shiming said, "The topic may be common, but there are many subtleties to it."

Someone else chimed in, "This topic is both elegant and refined. Needless to say, the answer must be good."

Chang Qingyun said, "If it's good, don't praise it yet. If you praise it all now, there will be nothing left to say when someone guesses it."

Suo Pu couldn't stand it anymore and whispered to Xie Peng, "What the hell is this?"

Xie Peng replied, "It's making riddles out of the content of the Four Books and Five Classics. It's nothing special. The answer is 'shi er you' (when an official has fulfilled his duties). I don't know why that fellow Xie is so pleased with himself."

Suddenly, someone slammed their hand on the table. "Excellent!" Everyone was startled and looked over. It was Mr. Xianhe.

Mei Lun asked, "Mr. Xianhe, what was so excellent that you had to slam the table like that?"

Mr. Xianhe said, "'Treating the official world as a theater stage.' I've got it. Is it 'shi er you'?"

Xie Shiming said, "Yes."

Mei Lun asked, "What's so clever about this riddle that it made the old master react so dramatically?"

Mr. Xianhe clapped his hands in praise. "The riddle itself is nothing special. All of you could make it and guess it. But there's another layer to it. This one is a cut above 'Lingxiaohua'."

Chang Qingyun laughed. "In my opinion, they're the same. What's the difference? If you say one is superior, I disagree. If Mr. Xianhe can't explain why, he'll have to drink three cups as a penalty!"

Mr. Xianhe said, "Listen to my explanation. The borrowing of the concept is one thing, but the playful use of the character 'er' (and/but) as a function word is what truly captures the essence. This riddle uses a character as a function word to achieve the utmost literary skill. In riddles, borrowing is considered the highest form, followed by direct representation. But there are two types of borrowing. For example, for 'Guoshi Wushuang' (Peerless Scholar), the answer is 'he wei xin' (what is meant by trust?); for 'The King of Qin abolishes the order to expel foreign officials,' the answer is 'xin si yan ye' (trust these words). Although these also use borrowing, they focus on the theme's meaning, which is worlds apart from focusing on the theme's surface, so they are of a lower order. Recently, there's also a type that relies on citing classics, where people spend all day looking up things in encyclopedias. But before the ink is dry on the riddle, it's already solved in a flash. That's third-rate stuff."

This profound discourse made everyone at the table nod frequently, all praising the cleverness of the riddle and Mr. Xie's great talent. A smug look appeared on Xie Shiming's face. Suo Pu, however, felt like Li Kui, wanting to jump on the table and shout, "Damn you all, eat my machine gun!" He couldn't help but mutter, "What a load of nonsense!"

Though his voice was low, Xie Shiming seemed to have overheard it. He was already displeased with the respectful treatment this "distinguished guest" was receiving. Now, wanting to embarrass him, he raised his cup and toasted the group. "Thank you all for your praise. On such a beautiful day and in such fine scenery, I, in my humble talent, have composed a poem to celebrate!"

He then recited in a loud voice:

> The flying tower straddles the perilous battlements, clouds and mist drift by at dawn.
> The strategic landscape offers a fine view, a fitting place for leisure after official duties.
> The river stretches wide before the parapet, the mountains entering the ornate screens are wondrous.
> The wind and moon are priceless, and Your Excellency, moreover, has poetry.

A chorus of cheers erupted. Chang Qingyun said, "It has the artistic conception of the Song poets." Mr. Xianhe gave a faint, cold smile but joined in the applause. Xie Shiming glanced smugly at Suo Pu and his companions. He saw a slight look of displeasure on Xie Peng's face. Lin Ming still wore his usual smiling, affable expression. But Suo Pu's face was indifferent. He clearly hadn't appreciated the poem's charm.

He couldn't help but curse inwardly, "Truly casting pearls before swine!"

Mr. Xianhe said, "This poem is exquisitely crafted. We should all drink a toast to it." He raised his cup, and everyone drank together. Putting down his cup, Mr. Xianhe sighed, "This Guoshi Wushuang is truly peerless! A pity it's so expensive and hard to come by."

Chang Qingyun laughed. "What's so difficult about that? If the old master likes it, I have a few more bottles here. I'll have them sent to you tomorrow. I only ask that the old master compose a few more lines of poetry to go with the wine."

Mr. Xianhe smiled. "I'll return your words: what's so difficult about that?" He tapped his bowl with his chopsticks and chanted in a soft voice:

> Wine does not intoxicate, man intoxicates himself,
> A thousand cups drunk, Liu Ling would be ashamed.
> Drinking with the moon, Chang'e as my companion,
> A river of sorrow meets in the wine.
> Slaughtering sheep and oxen for merriment,
> One must drink a thousand cups at a time.
> Drunk at the table, do not laugh at me,
> How many can understand the deep taste of wine?

The poem's meaning was shallow, barely more than a ditty. Even Suo Pu could understand it completely. This Mr. Xianhe seemed to be a man full of grievances. He saw the singer Yundang holding her pipa, her cherry-like lips murmuring the words, her eyes constantly glancing towards Mr. Xianhe, clearly showing admiration. He couldn't help but wonder: what was there to admire about this half-old man with a penchant for boys? A sour feeling rose in his heart.

After reciting, Mr. Xianhe drained his cup again and laughed. "The Kun people may be detestable, but their crafts and tools are not without ingenuity. Truly remarkable."

"If the Kunzei were willing to submit to the court, it would be a blessing for our Great Ming."

"Their ships are strong and their cannons are sharp, and their soldiers are skilled in battle. If we pacified them and sent the entire army to Liaodong to quell the eastern barbarians, it would be a brilliant move that achieves two goals at once, regardless of victory or defeat."

"The Kun people claim to be descendants of the Great Song, but they are actually foreign barbarians using a false pretext," Xie Shiming said. "Their glass mirrors, thermos flasks, and lighters are all just clever trinkets. They can't feed the hungry or clothe the cold. They are just embellishments. Even their great cannons and warships, which seem to rival nature's work, what good are they if the whole world rebels? Can a few cannons manage that? Can warships be brought ashore? To order the family, govern the state, and bring peace to the world, one must still rely on moral principles and literature!"

Several old scholars nodded repeatedly, praising Xie Shiming: "His poetry is good, and his insight is even more profound." Someone else mentioned the Kunzei's disregard for etiquette and their many licentious and shameless acts, which actually piqued everyone's interest. For a time, all sorts of anecdotes and interesting stories flew around, making Suo Pu shake his head repeatedly. Storytellers have truly existed since ancient times.

Mr. Xianhe, however, said, "I hear that Master Chang was once trapped in Lin'gao for several years and has seen the true Kun with his own eyes. Why don't you tell us about your experiences with the Kunzei?"

Chang Qingyun gave a bitter smile. "I was captured in Lin'gao during the campaign against General He. It is a matter of great regret for me. However, because of this, I also learned a great deal about the Kunzei's internal affairs..."

This was true. Chang Qingyun's position as a secretary in the Viceroy's yamen was largely due to his being one of the few local talents proficient in "Kun affairs."

"...This is a place for pleasure. To speak of military matters would spoil the mood. When I was imprisoned, I tried to find joy in my suffering and composed fifty 'Lin'gao Bamboo Branch Lyrics.' Today, I will recite a few for you to enjoy with your wine."

Suo Pu's heart skipped a beat. He never thought there would be a former prisoner from Lin'gao here! This Chang Qingyun was probably one of the secretaries of He Rubin who had been captured during the counter-encirclement campaign. He couldn't believe he had managed to find a position in Xiong Wencan's staff!

Since he had been to Lin'gao, had he seen through his disguise? It was even possible that he had seen him before! Suo Pu remembered inspecting the prisoner-of-war camp. Of course, at that time, he wouldn't have noticed if a figure like Chang Qingyun was among the crowd of trembling, shaven-headed wretches in their "new life uniforms."

Suo Pu forced himself to remain calm and looked at the scholar. With a composed expression, Chang Qingyun began to recite:

> On the road to the edge of the sky, Hainan, there is a county called Lin'gao.
> The land is hot, suitable for ice; the buildings are tall, one can pluck the stars.
> With sincerity, they honor rites and worship; with good hearts, they uphold the scriptures.
> The only regret is General Feihuang, whose warfare never ceases.

> The mountains and lakes are endowed with spiritual beauty, the layered peaks unfold like painted eyebrows.
> The law honors women as noble, the earth nourishes with yin.
> Young girls have rosy faces, beautiful women have skin of white jade.
> Love has always been cherished, husband and wife live happily together.

> Tall pavilions rise layer upon layer, luxurious mansions stand grand.
> Iron railings guard the dense households, a river flows around the walls.
> The whitewashed walls are painted with colors, glass adorns the brocade red.
> Best to view from the street, the buildings are like a painting.

> The main roads are wide and flat, with straight intersecting streets.
> Scholars and ladies walk on the sides, carriages gallop in the middle.
> The night market is bustling with people, the autumn night is filled with lingering rain.
> Evening lamps hang along the roads, their flames as bright as stars.

He recited a verse, then added a brief explanation. The crowd's interest was greatly piqued, and a lively discussion ensued.

Xie Shiming, however, was a little unhappy. He had just had his moment in the spotlight, only to have it stolen by Mr. Xianhe and Chang Qingyun. He had had a few too many drinks and became somewhat reckless. His gaze fell on Suo Pu. Remembering the "load of nonsense" comment, he harbored a grudge and wanted to embarrass him. He raised his cup and said, "Master Suo is sitting there bored. Why not compose a poem to liven things up?"

Lin Ming saw that the situation was turning sour. The chiefs might know everything from astronomy to geography and be skilled in a hundred crafts, but they were utterly "ignorant" when it came to poetry. Not only could they not compose a poem, but they would struggle to even come up with a rhyming sentence. He had seen the so-called new poetry of the Australians in the literary section of the Lin'gao newspaper—things like "The Senate is better than my father" and "The noodles I make are the best in the world." If he were to recite such things, these scholars would laugh their heads off. It seemed this sour scholar was determined to put Suo Pu on the spot.

Suo Pu smiled faintly. "I am untalented and do not know these things."

Mei Lun thought, *Oh no*, and cursed this sour Xie for being a busybody. Many in the Jinyiwei were from noble families and were not well-versed in literature. To embarrass someone like this in public, even if he didn't react at the time, he might hold a grudge and make a big issue out of it later! Just as he was about to intervene, Chang Qingyun had already stepped in to smooth things over.

"Master Suo is a military man and is probably not interested in poetry and song. Come, come, let's have the boys sing for our entertainment..."

Mei Lun quickly called the two singers in to serve. The two boys had already finished their meal. Suo Pu had noticed that not only did they eat kneeling on the floor, but they had also licked their plates clean. He couldn't help but frown. What was this about? Were they that hungry? Hearing the call, the boys quickly came forward, first kowtowing to thank them for the reward.

"Sing the bawdy ones, to go with the masters' wine!" Mei Lun laughed.

The boys understood and sang another set of songs. These were not "elegant" ones, but full of lewd and romantic lyrics. The men, now drunk, were laughing and shouting, creating a ruckus.

Seeing there was no point in staying any longer, Suo Pu signaled to Lin Ming and rose to leave. Chang Qingyun said a few polite words and was about to see them off when Xie Shiming, now quite drunk, used his intoxication as a cover to act up. "Don't go... don't go... In such a peaceful and prosperous age, on such a fine day, to leave without enjoying yourselves to the fullest is simply... simply... spoiling the mood... absolutely not!" He then tried to force Suo Pu to drink.

Suo Pu was already annoyed by their boorish behavior. Now, seeing this sour scholar acting drunk, he gave a cold laugh. "A peaceful and prosperous age? A fine day? Bandits are ravaging the Central Plains, the eastern barbarians have repeatedly breached the borders, the people are suffering... You all are certainly in high spirits. As they say, 'To sing merrily on a leaking boat, to drink heartily in a burning house, and not know that disaster is imminent, how pitiful!'"

His voice was not loud, but it was like a bucket of ice water poured over the revelers. The large hall fell silent.

Suo Pu continued, "Last year, I traveled through the Three Towns and climbed the Yellow Crane Tower. I saw an old scholar, grieving over the country's decline, who wrote a poem on the wall. I cannot compose poetry myself, so I will offer this as a gift." He then recited in a clear, resonant voice:

> The misty trees recede from view, a spiritual journey to the homeland,
> The hegemonic aura of the rivers and mountains is but a fleeting bubble.
> The yellow crane, returning, should shed tears, tears that fill the islet.
> Mourning the great river in autumn, with so much idle sorrow,
> The endless stream of exiles and pure scholars.
> Which hero will ascend to the absolute peak, and weep for the divine land?

After reciting, he flicked his sleeve and left.

Back on the boat, Suo Pu was silent and sullen. Lin Ming thought he had lost face over the poetry matter and tried to comfort him. "Master Suo, don't be upset. Poetry is just a pastime. Who relies on it to build a career..."

Suo Pu said, "I'm not upset about that. What use are a few lines of poetry? I'm just... I'm just..." He didn't know what to say for a moment. After a long pause, he said, "These are the cream of the crop, scholars chosen from tens of thousands, and this is how they are. What use are they to the country or the people?"

Lin Ming thought, *This is strange. The 'country' and 'people' are not Australia's. Why is an Australian Senator worried about this?* Then he understood and comforted him, "The Chief is overthinking it. Don't mind that they only know classical platitudes and get smug over a few crooked poems now. If one day the Great Song's imperial examinations are held, they will learn 'Australian studies' just the same..."

As they were talking, someone came to report, "Master Chang is here to pay a visit."

"Eh? What is he doing here?" Suo Pu looked at Lin Ming in confusion. "Why didn't he say what he wanted to say at the banquet?"

"There's no harm in inviting him in to talk," Lin Ming said. "There are probably some things that couldn't be said at the banquet."

"Alright, then invite him in."

After the greetings were exchanged, Suo Pu was wondering how to begin when Chang Qingyun cut straight to the point. "This Master Suo is probably a 'chief,' isn't he?"

Suo Pu was stunned. Lin Ming's eyes already showed a murderous glint. Xie Peng also quietly drew his dagger. Suo Pu shook his head slightly, signaling them not to act rashly. "Why do you say that?"

"Master Suo, I spent a full year and a half in Lin'gao," Chang Qingyun said calmly. "Digging sand, breaking rocks, carrying earth, paving roads... I did all the work I had never done in my life, and suffered all the hardships I had never suffered." He sighed. "I have seen more than a dozen chiefs like Master Suo—of course, they may not remember a person like me."

He continued, "...But anyone who has met an Australian chief a few times will never forget their expression. Master Suo, although there are no flaws in your speech or mannerisms, the air about you is unmistakable."

Suo Pu laughed. "Mr. Chang, you truly flatter me. In that case, what is your intention?"
