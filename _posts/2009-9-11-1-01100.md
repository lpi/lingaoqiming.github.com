"We understand, thank you, Master Gao." [Wen Desi][y002] merely expressed his thanks and said nothing else.

Gao Ju saw that they were unwilling to say much about their ship, so he didn't press the matter. He just called for the servants who looked after the house to come and meet them: a middle-aged couple leading a pair of thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy and girl. They all came over to kowtow and pay their respects.

"This family of servants, although not born in the house, are people whose lives I saved from Jiangxi many years ago. They are all loyal and reliable."

Hearing the master speak thus, the family kowtowed again and again.

"That's enough, that's enough." Gao Ju instructed, "These gentlemen will be your masters from now on. You must serve them with all your heart."

"Yes, we servants know!" With that, the whole family came over to kowtow to [Wen Desi][y002] and his party. "We servants greet our masters."

"This, this, this..." The three men were taken aback and half rose from their seats. They were all modern people. To suddenly have a whole family kneeling on the ground and kowtowing to you, anyone would feel uncomfortable.

"These are their deeds of sale." Master Gao took out a few sheets of paper from his sleeve. "They are all sold absolutely. You esteemed guests can command them as you wish, without any worries."

"This is the deed to this residence." Master Gao took out another document. "I had originally said I would buy a house on your behalf, but it was inconvenient for a time. If you do not dislike this humble abode, please take up temporary residence here."

"This..." The three men looked at each other. This merchant had a grand style! Although his intention of currying favor by gifting a house and servants was extremely obvious, his出手 was so generous that it showed his sincerity.

However, upon careful consideration, this pie falling from the sky had another meaning.

The house was his private residence. He knew all its details. If he wanted to secretly investigate and monitor them, he would be in the dark, and the transmigrators in the light.

This family of servants had been raised by him for many years. To say they were loyal and reliable was to him, not to this group of sea merchants of unknown origin. If they were placed by their side to monitor them, then the transmigrators' every move and every word would be completely under his control.

This feeling was like living in a glass house, completely naked.

Besides currying favor with them, the important thing for Master Gao was to try to control them in the palm of his hand. As for why he did this, it was obviously because the goods they brought had given Master Gao enormous profits.

Originally, they had only wanted to buy a house as a foothold in Guangzhou, and then slowly expand after the transmigration. Now, they had gotten a house and a family of servants for free. The development of events had greatly exceeded their expectations.

However, refusal was not the best policy. [Xiao Zishan][y001] calculated for a moment. Anyway, the transmigration trade activities would not be carried out many more times. As long as they were careful each time, they would not be exposed. After the transmigration, how to carry out activities in Guangzhou city could be considered again. For now, it was better to stabilize Master Gao and let him sell more goods for them.

They exchanged glances. [Wen Desi][y002] then cupped his hands in thanks and accepted the documents. He also took out one tael of silver as a reward for the kowtow acknowledging them as masters.

Master Gao was very pleased to see that they had no objections. He ordered his servants to move all their silver and goods to the new residence. He also ordered people to send over a lot of food and clothing, being extremely attentive.

[Xiao Zishan][y001], [Wen Desi][y002], and [Wang Luobin][y003] discussed in a low voice and felt that since they were here, they should make the best of it. They might as well inspect the house thoroughly first, see how to use it, and also sound out the servants. So they called the male servant over for questioning.

The male servant looked quite old. [Xiao Zishan][y001] estimated that he was at least in his fifties. Seeing him come over to stand and wait on them, his hands hanging down, his face full of reverence, [Chief Wen][y002] and [Engineer Wang][y003] both felt a little uneasy. But [Xiao Zishan][y001] remained calm, first taking a sip of tea, and after a long silence, he began to ask questions.

This male servant's original surname was Liu, and his name was Qing. He was originally from Jiangxi and was a tenant farmer of about ten mu of land. In the forty-fifth year of the Wanli reign, he fled the famine after a flood destroyed the crops in his hometown. As his family was on the verge of death by the side of the official road, Master Gao happened to be passing by on his way back from selling goods in Nanjing. He took in more than ten families of disaster victims as slaves, and he was lucky enough to be chosen. From then on, he served as a slave in the Gao family.

After arriving at the Gao family, he took the master's surname, so he became Gao Qing, and his wife was called Gao Xian. Both husband and wife worked as general servants in the outer courtyard of the Gao residence. It was only less than half a month ago that they were transferred here to guard the outer residence.

As for his age, he was actually only in his early forties. He himself was not clear on his exact age. [Xiao Zishan][y001] knew that it was not uncommon for peasants in the old days not to know their exact age.

"Guarding the house here, is it better than being a general servant in the main residence?"

Gao Qing smiled bitterly and said, "Replying to master, the work here is light and leisurely, and there is no one to restrain us, but making a living has become difficult."

It turned out that when he and his wife worked in the main residence, although each person's monthly wage was only two qian of silver, they did not have to pay for food, as it was all provided by the communal kitchen. Not only were they not hungry themselves, but their two children could also get their bellies full. Since being transferred here, his monthly wage had increased to five qian, but he had to cook for himself. Firewood, rice, oil, salt, and vegetables were all his own expenses, and his children could no longer get free meals. Children of thirteen or fourteen are at an age where they eat a lot. The family of four had to live on seven qian of silver, which was really a bit of a struggle.

[Wen Desi][y002] asked, "What, the children have no wages? Aren't they also Master Gao's?"

"The children have never been assigned a job," Gao Qing shook his head repeatedly. "If they don't have a job, the residence doesn't give them money or rice. They all rely on their parents to support them." He sighed again, "I originally wanted to get my daughter a job in the inner residence. At least she could earn a string of cash. But my daughter is not good-looking and was never chosen. I asked the housekeeper's wife for help, but she insisted on ten taels of silver. How could my family save up so much money!"

This corruption really has a long history and is all-pervasive. The three people present all sighed with emotion. Even to become a maid, one had to spend money. But thinking of the series of public relations activities that Liu's family undertook in "Dream of the Red Chamber" so that Wu'er could get a job in the Yihongyuan, a public institution in the Daguanyuan, this was not surprising.

"Now that you are working for us here, are you willing in your heart?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] asked in a softer voice.

Gao Qing looked uneasily at these sea merchant masters who couldn't even wear their clothes properly, and replied, "We are servants, there is no such thing as willing or not. Since we are the masters' people, we will do whatever the masters command."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] nodded and ordered him to lead the way, first inspecting the entire house. The house was not large. Each section had a pattern of one bright room and two dark rooms. The first section was the living room and study, the second section had a second floor and was the living quarters, and the third section had a kitchen, a woodshed, a mule and horse shed, and its own well. Although the house was not new, it was very well built, with green bricks laid flat, making it very sturdy. Because it was intended for emergency shelter, the furniture and furnishings in the house were very simple, but the daily necessities were very complete. The kitchen was also piled with a lot of rice, cured meat, dried fish, and firewood, rice, oil, and salt sent from the Gao residence. Gao Qing handed over a gift list for the masters to check. [Wen Desi][y002] was originally not very interested in these things and was about to say, "Give it all to your family." But before the words came out, he saw [Xiao Zishan][y001] taking the list and examining it.
