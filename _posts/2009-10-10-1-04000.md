"They've all been settled in, placed in Room 106 of Building 7." [Xiao Zishan][y001] held a folder and pretended to look at it. In truth, he remembered without looking; it was just a habit from his years as a white-collar worker in meetings.

"Meng Xian, twenty-five, has been abroad, fluent in English, studied finance and accounting."

"Pan Feng, twenty-eight, unemployed. Claims to have been a representative in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. Single."

"Zha Wuchu, twenty-four, technician at a pharmaceutical factory. Single."

"Tian Jiujiu, twenty-seven, technician at the X City Water Conservancy Design Institute in X Province, specializing in water supply and drainage. Single."

"Great! Apart from one useless one, they are all useful professionals," Wei Aiwen said, slamming the table happily and deliberately glancing at [Xiao Zishan][y001].

Of course, [Xiao Zishan][y001] knew what he meant. In his heart, he despised this boisterous fellow. But he never let the contempt show on his face, nor did he argue with him openly. He knew very well that even at this card game, he didn't truly belong in this room.

The others just nodded silently. [Xiao Zishan][y001] continued his report:

"I had a casual chat with all of them. Everyone is very enthusiastic about the transmigration and their attitude is quite firm."

This so-called chat was the Executive Committee's first screening of new members. Through a welcoming conversation, they could get a general idea of the newcomer's background and personality, to see if they had enough team spirit and good emotional intelligence to be suitable for this unprecedented adventure.

"Meng Xian is extremely fond of light weapons. He trained in moving target shooting at a sports school for a few years and showed great interest in firearms during our conversation."

"Pan Feng spoke very little throughout the process. He has a more reserved personality. His hobbies are gardening and literature, and he is very knowledgeable about the FMCG industry. He has an accountant certificate."

"Tian Jiujiu..."

After briefly introducing his impressions and views on the newcomers, [Xiao Zishan][y001] also provided the Executive Committee with a list of the personal belongings they had registered.

"I have written a basic introduction, which will be submitted to the Internal Affairs Group tonight along with the registration forms. That group will conduct the next stage of assessment and review. Someone has already been arranged to live with them."

"Who was arranged to go?" [Wen Desi][y002] asked.

"I'm not clear on that. Future matters are under the jurisdiction of the Internal Affairs Group," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said, spreading his hands. "Should I ask in a bit?"

"No need." The gazes of [Wen Desi][y002], [Ma Qianzhu][y005], and [Xiao Zishan][y001] met for a moment.

"In that case, as of now, we have 476 effective check-ins."

Since the personnel began gathering six months ago, people had been arriving almost every week. They all went through the same process as Meng Xian and his group.

Of the 2,106 people who had enthusiastically discussed and replied to the posts about transmigrating through the wormhole, fewer than 800 had joined the subsequent Skype chat group. And of those, fewer than 500 had actually come here and stayed.

"Have many people left?"

"About 50 or so, in total. These 476 are the ones currently determined to participate in the transmigration." [Xiao Zishan][y001] looked at the list. "There should be about 50 more people arriving in the next two weeks. These ones should all come."

"The 'Thousand Nobles' will become the 'Five Hundred Man Council'," Wei Aiwen lamented. "Too few people. When it was just talk, they were all full of fighting spirit. When it's time for action, they all turn into damn cowards!"

The others remained silent. Whether more people were better or fewer people were better was a paradox. For these members of the Executive Committee, fewer people seemed more advantageous. More people meant more minds, more opinions. In the end, although the Executive Committee was responsible for all the preparations, they hadn't really consulted the masses. The masses were currently obeying the committee's arrangements, but that was just the blind compliance that comes with arriving in a strange new place. Once this group of people became familiar with each other, there was no telling what kind of trouble they might stir up.

"It's better to have a lean and capable team," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said, trying to smooth things over.

"Speaking of which, we do have talent in all areas. We're not lacking anything," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with some satisfaction. "It's just that there are fewer girls. Most of them are accompanying their husbands or boyfriends. Not many are single."

"That's natural. Most of the people who come are bachelors," [Wen Desi][y002] said, tilting his head back. "Who with a family would come here to do this..."

Wei Aiwen said, "Women are just trouble, whining and complaining all day long."

"Then don't you dare ask the organization for a wife in the future. We're not in charge of that."

"Like I care! Ancient lolis, I can have as many as I want. One to massage my back, one to rub my waist, and another one..."

Xi Yazhou interrupted him impatiently, "'I', 'I', 'I'. You're just a kid, and you keep talking like you're the boss. With that attitude, no woman would ever be interested in you!"

"It's okay, Little Wei. Brokeback Mountain was very developed in the Ming Dynasty, and it was only played by high-quality talent..."

"Bullshit! You're the one who's Brokeback Mountain! Your whole family is Brokeback Mountain!" the young man flared up. Teasing him had become a habit here.

"By the way, I have a question for the Executive Committee," [Xiao Zishan][y001] said. "It's about foreigners."

"Foreigners? No! They'll be a lot of trouble later on!"

"I also oppose foreigners. Those not of our race are bound to have different hearts!"

"This one is rather special," [Xiao Zishan][y001] continued.

"Don't tell me it's a military doctor who served in the Iraq War. If so, we can consider it."

"No... it's the girlfriend of one of the applicants." [Xiao Zishan][y001] pulled a piece of paper from his folder and began to read. "Ding Ding, male, 32, Han Chinese, reporter for a large media group. This foreign girl is called Panpan? Seems to be an American."

"Damn, a Western chick!" Wei Aiwen's head popped over. "Are there photos? Are there photos?"

"She's someone's girlfriend, what are you getting so excited about? Stay on the side."

"We must investigate! She might be an American spy," Wei Aiwen gesticulated wildly. "She must have been sent by the FBI to infiltrate us, to prevent us from rewriting history!"

"Little Wei, do you even know what the FBI does?" the know-it-all [Luo Duo][y011] chimed in to correct his technical error.

"Whatever, it's an American spy organization. They also protect the president!"

"Should we let you investigate her?"

"I will definitely complete the mission assigned to me by the organization!" the young man pledged with a sincere and resolute attitude. Zhong Lishi, who had been joking with him, saw his serious expression and felt a bit embarrassed to continue teasing him.

[Wen Desi][y002] nodded. "I personally agree. After all, she is a family member. If she wants to go, let's take her. Even if she wanted to be loyal to the United States, there would be no place for her to do so."

"Alright. I'll confirm with him. Speaking of which, we don't have anyone from the media and propaganda field yet. He could be a useful talent in the future."

"We need talent in every profession, and we also need ordinary people who aren't 'talent'," [Wen Desi][y002] emphasized. "When receiving new arrivals, we must be careful not to be warmer to those with professional skills and colder to those without. That's not good."

"I understand that. It's about promoting unity."

Meng Xian lay on the iron-framed bed in the dormitory, staring at the large luggage bag on the top bunk. It was extremely quiet outside. He could clearly hear the sounds of a porn movie someone was watching upstairs.

The enthusiasm he had felt all the way here, once the quiet set in, was replaced by an unshakable sense of panic.

*What's wrong with me... have I gone mad? I quit a good job in the US to come to this rural part of Guangdong. What on earth am I trying to do?*

Change my destiny? Remake history?

Meng Xian enjoyed reading alternate history fanfiction and had fantasized about transmigrating to another time to rebuild China, achieve great things, and have three wives and four concubines. But he knew that was just fiction.

Once he passed through the wormhole, he would disappear from this world. It was the same as dying.

Parents, relatives, friends, and a future wife... Of course, he didn't have a girlfriend now, let alone a wife. But! If he hadn't come here, he probably could have had a decent wife...

At that moment, Meng Xian almost had the urge to quit. He sat up abruptly. He saw his roommate, Ye Yuming, also staring blankly. He had moved into the dorm before them.

"What, can't sleep?" Seeing him sit up, Ye Yuming tossed him a cigarette.

"I don't smoke..."

"Alright then, I won't either. What's up, not going online to play?"

"Don't have the energy," Meng Xian sighed. "I don't know when we'll be leaving." Although the words were somewhat insincere, they also contained a grain of truth—if they had already transmigrated, he would have resigned himself to his fate. This dilemma was the most unbearable.

"Are you really looking forward to D-Day that much?"

"Aren't you?"

"Hard to say... it feels unreliable." Ye Yuming sniffed the cigarette. "If it weren't for the fact that [Director Wen][y002] and [Director Ma][y005] are people I trust, plus..." He paused. "I'd be a little afraid it's a scam."

"It shouldn't be, right?" Meng Xian's confidence wavered a little.

"Yeah, I don't think so either. That's why I came. But, what will happen when we get there, it's really hard to say."

"Hasn't [Director Wen][y002] already taken people there many times?"

"But there are so many of us, and all our stuff. What if the energy explodes? Or what if there's some accident after we transmigrate..." Ye Yuming's expression was grave. "If you lose your life, there's no 'LOAD' game."

"Maybe you'll be resurrected in this dimension," Pan Feng, who had been reading a book on the side, suddenly interjected.

"Haha, you're something else." Both Ye Yuming and Meng Xian laughed.

Pan Feng tossed his book aside and sat up. "According to the usual transmigration tropes, don't people get struck by lightning, hit by a car, or drown? So if you die in the other dimension, you should be resurrected in this one, right?"

"If there's a Time-Space Administration Bureau, you can apply for resurrection right after you die." Meng Xian laughed for a while, feeling a little more relaxed. "Little Pan, you said you were in sales. What did you sell?"

"Me? You guys won't laugh, but my longest sales experience was selling sanitary napkins."

The whole dorm burst into laughter. Zha Wuchu slapped the bed frame, laughing, "You're just making that up! You sold sanitary napkins? Which girl would buy from you..."

Pan Feng picked up the cigarette Meng Xian had tossed aside. "I'll smoke one if you don't mind."

"Go ahead, go ahead." Ye Yuming even lit it for him and took one for himself.

Pan Feng took a drag. "I did channel sales, selling directly to wholesalers. It had nothing to do with girls... FMCG is getting harder and harder these days. More and more competitors, more and more arrogant customers, higher and higher demands from the company, but the salary never changes..."

"Do you think this whole thing is reliable?" Ye Yuming pressed.

Pan Feng glanced at him, a slight smile playing on his lips.

"Why wouldn't it be? Unless [Director Wen][y002] has gone insane, why would he be doing all this? To scam people out of money? The scale of this operation is so large he'd have to be paying out of his own pocket."

"So you really want to transmigrate?" Ye Yuming asked immediately.

"Transmigrate, why not?" Pan Feng flicked his ash. "I'm one of the 'working poor.' I went to university, I work hard, but after all these years, all I can earn is a little money. I have to save some in case I get sick, and if I get married and buy a house, I become a mortgage slave. And if you complain, there are people who will tell you to go swim across the Pacific for a few cents." He smiled. "Brothers, do you know what it means to take a desperate risk? I'm timid, a law-abiding citizen since I was a kid. I don't dare to do anything illegal in this world, but life is frustrating. So, I came here to take a desperate risk."

The dormitory fell silent. His words had probably struck a chord in everyone's heart. Ye Yuming smiled faintly, lay down, and began to mentally compose his report for the Internal Affairs Group.
