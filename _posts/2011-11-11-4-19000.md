Li Fengjie, though finding the plan feasible, couldn't help but shake his head at the thought of incurring such a massive debt. "A loan must be repaid, and with interest, that's a huge sum of money!"

"The autumn tax collection begins in a few days. A small surcharge on each mu of land will cover it," He Chengzong said. "If the Kun thieves don't leave, I'm afraid the autumn tax collection itself will be very troublesome..."

This last sentence struck a chord with Li Fengjie. Everything a local official did revolved around taxes, the court's primary concern. With the Kun thieves squatting on Henan Island, sending out men daily to collect grain and silver, how could the autumn tax collection begin in November? He Chengzong was right. As long as the autumn grain was collected, the three-hundred-thousand-tael deficit could be filled.

However, three hundred thousand taels was no small sum. The thought of taking on this debt for no good reason put Li Fengjie in a very foul mood.

Why should such a thankless task fall on him! These Australians had such a huge appetite! Thinking this, he decided he still had to bargain with them, to at least knock off eighty or a hundred thousand.

He gave no definite answer to He Chengzong's proposal, simply dismissing him.

He Chengzong was baffled. The next day, Gao Ju came to visit, asking for the governor's final decision so he could send Little Hat Yan across the river again that night to continue the talks.

"His Excellency gave no definite answer," He Chengzong said. "He neither said yes nor no."

"Perhaps His Excellency needs more time to consider," Gao Ju said with a hollow laugh. Since he didn't say "yes," it was effectively a "no." The governor most likely still wanted to haggle. He sneered inwardly: this is what you call refusing a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit.

Sure enough, over the next few days, Li Fengjie made a show of military preparations in Guangzhou, conscripting militia and setting up cannons, putting on a display of "fighting to the death." Everyone was confused. He Chengzong even thought his patron was truly going to "live or die with the city." He was greatly alarmed and tried to advise him several times, but Li Fengjie brushed him off with noncommittal replies.

Gao Ju, however, knew the governor was just putting on a show for the Kun thieves outside the city, hoping to intimidate them into lowering the ransom fee.

As expected, a day later, Li Fengjie again asked Gao Ju to go to the Lotus Abode to continue the talks.

"Your Excellency, if there's no decision on the ransom fee, I'm afraid I won't be able to achieve anything even if I go again."

"You are a merchant. Do you buy goods at whatever price the seller asks?" Li Fengjie was very dissatisfied with Gao Ju's attitude.

Gao Ju said respectfully, "Your Excellency, it depends on the goods. If it's a rare commodity, of course, I'll buy it at whatever price he asks."

"Alright, alright. Go and tell the Kun thieves that three hundred thousand taels is too much; the city can't afford it. Tell them to reduce it."

"How much does Your Excellency think is a suitable reduction..."

"Well, doesn't that depend on your ability?" Li Fengjie sneered.

"Yes, yes, I will do my utmost."

This attitude naturally displeased the high command of the task force. Some elders had already been demanding a large-scale rocket attack on Guangzhou to knock the Guangdong officials down a peg. However, a group of elders, including Wen Desi, had strongly opposed it. This was not, of course, for reasons like "protecting cultural relics," but because Guangzhou, like all Chinese cities at the time, was primarily composed of brick-and-wood buildings. An indiscriminate bombardment with a large number of Hale rockets would inevitably cause massive fires, possibly engulfing the entire city.

Guangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in all of China. One could imagine how much wealth a city-wide fire would destroy and how many useful human resources would be killed. Many wealthy merchants would go bankrupt, and the consequences would be dire. The transmigrators would be unable to utilize the city for years after the war.

Now, Li Fengjie's attitude brought the idea of bombarding Guangzhou back to the forefront. Several elders accompanying the fleet demanded this "show of force."

Wen Desi, perhaps also feeling it was necessary to display their military power—seeing is believing, lest the bureaucrats hiding in the city lack a direct impression of the transmigrators' strength—approved the plan to bombard the southern part of Guangzhou. To avoid large-scale loss of life and property, the targets were mainly the southern city's defense facilities and the post stations, reception halls, and wharves near the south gate.

On the evening of November 7th, the Fubo Army launched over 200 Hale rockets from preset positions and mortar boats, completely burning down many defense facilities, post stations, and reception halls near the south gate. The government troops and militia guarding the south gate were thrown into chaos. The rockets from the mortar boats also concentrated their fire on the magnificent three-story gate tower above the south gate. Under the concentrated bombardment of nearly 40 Hale rockets, the brick-and-wood structure was soon engulfed in flames and burned through the night.

On Chen Haiyang's orders, several rockets were also fired into the deeper areas of Guangzhou, targeting government offices, to demonstrate their power.

Li Fengjie spent a nightmarish evening. When the dense rockets began to bombard the southern city, and the reception halls and post stations caught fire, and finally even the gate tower was ablaze, he thought the Kun thieves were about to storm the city. He rushed to the south gate with some of his advisors. But before he could get there, the road was blocked by fleeing government troops and militia. Their faces blackened by smoke, they scrambled through the streets in panic, ignoring the officers trying to stop them. When the crowd finally passed, he no longer dared to go forward—those terrifying Australian fire-stars were constantly falling from the sky. If one hit him on the head, it would be over.

"Go, back to the yamen!" Li Fengjie quickly ordered. Surrounded by his personal guards and family, he hurried back to the governor's yamen and called for two hundred more of his personal troops as reinforcements. Li Fengjie climbed a corner tower and looked towards the south gate—the flames blazed, painting half the sky red, a terrifying sight. A thought flashed through his mind: if the Kun thieves broke through the city, he would immediately commit suicide in the yamen.

Just then, a dozen rockets, like shooting stars, streaked across the night sky, flying deep into the city, landing in streets and government offices, erupting in flames with a roar.

Water gongs clanged throughout the streets as militia and fire guild members rushed to extinguish the fires. Fortunately, few rockets landed here, and the fires were put out as soon as they started, preventing greater damage. But the attack caused even greater panic.

Li Fengjie was restless, whether inside or outside. The death falling from the sky filled him with a fear he had never experienced before. In the past, as long as he was behind the thick city walls, no amount of war and bloodshed outside could touch him. But now, the high, thick walls could no longer protect his life as they once did.

Fortunately, the Kun thieves showed no sign of attacking. After more than an hour, the rocket attack stopped. The officials, officers, and soldiers who had fled finally plucked up the courage to return to the south gate to fight the fire.

The day after this attack, Gao Ju went out of the city and agreed to all of Wen Desi's demands.

As for raising the money, Li Fengjie had no other choice but to adopt He Chengzong's "borrowing" plan—to get through the current crisis first.

The next day, He Chengzong went to Gao Ju's residence and explained the plan. Gao Ju was a leading figure among the city's foreign traders, and his attitude could influence many people.

Gao Ju was noncommittal. He raised his eyelids slightly. He hadn't expected He Chengzong to come up with this method. Gao Ju's own plan for Li Fengjie had also been based on "borrowing." However, Gao Ju's loan was well-structured: how to borrow, how to repay, the interest rate—he had already calculated it all in his head. He hadn't mentioned it yesterday to avoid suspicion. From the merchants' perspective, the government's credit was not very good. If the loan was defaulted on one day, his peers would inevitably curse him for "sucking up to the authorities," which would ruin his reputation.

Gao Ju had been pondering how to propose this to Li Fengjie. Now that He Chengzong had come to him, it couldn't be better.

"This is three hundred thousand taels," Gao Ju said slowly, tapping the tea table with his fan. "No one has ever lent such a large sum."

"Of course. That's why we need you, Master Gao, to use your influence, reason with them, and ask the various trading guilds to work together. If each household contributes a little, it will be easier."

Gao Ju smiled faintly. He Chengzong's thinking was still the same as the government's "apportionment" and "persuasion." In reality, as long as the profit was large enough, any amount of money could be borrowed. This Mr. He had not yet understood this principle. He deliberately put on an air of reluctance and said, "This matter will probably be difficult."

"I know it's difficult. But is there any other way to raise these three hundred thousand taels now?" He Chengzong said with a bitter smile. "The Kun thieves' warships are circling the Provincial River every day, making it clear they will attack Guangzhou if they don't get the money. This is for the sake of the city's people."

Gao Ju nodded. "I understand." He added, "A loan must be repaid. There must be a plan: how to borrow, how to repay, what the interest rate is, and what the term is. Let's hear the details first, and see if it's feasible."

"Borrow four hundred thousand—besides the ransom, we'll need to compensate the Australians for the loss of their businesses, at least twenty or thirty thousand taels. The Kun thieves have caused much death and destruction along the way, and there will be expenses for local relief. Finally, there will be expenses for managing things in the capital and the palace, to avoid trouble," He Chengzong sighed. "If we had won, it would have just been rewards for the army and some expenses for cleaning up. But with a defeat, the expenses are endless."

Since the fall of Humen, sixty thousand taels had been spent from the provincial treasury and the county treasuries' official quotas alone. But the money spent was not just from the treasury; it also included "contributions" from merchants, and the conscripted labor, materials, and rewards for the militia from various prefectures and counties.

The total cost of this "Defense of Guangzhou" was already a muddled account. And now, on top of it all, was this three-hundred-thousand-tael "ransom fee"!

Although He Chengzong didn't know the famous saying "victory is always cheaper," he had gained a profound understanding that defeat meant more spending. This further strengthened his future stance as a "peace advocate," or what some Ming ultranationalists would call a "surrenderist."

Gao Ju thought that of the extra hundred thousand in the four hundred thousand, while it had various uses, a large part was surely "padding" for the officials at all levels to line their pockets. The money hadn't even been borrowed yet, but the accounts for their benefits were already drawn up. The thought filled him with contempt.

However, as long as there was a profit to be made and the principal and interest could be guaranteed, he couldn't be bothered with how these officials came up with pretexts to get money. If they were all as pure as water and clear as a mirror, he, Gao Ju, wouldn't be in business.

"Four hundred thousand, five hundred thousand, let's not talk about the amount for now. But we need a clear statement on the interest rate, the term, how the interest will be paid, and how the principal will be repaid. Only then can I go and talk to everyone about this."

He Chengzong had already thought about this: "An annual interest rate of thirteen percent, for a term of one year, with principal and interest repaid in a lump sum at maturity."

Gao Ju said slowly, "Mr. He! With these terms, I, Gao, cannot make this proposal."

He Chengzong cursed inwardly, "A petty man who forgets righteousness at the sight of profit." But since he needed his help now, he had to patiently ask, "What is your opinion, Master Gao?"

"I have no 'opinion'," Gao Ju said. "Borrowing money is not like the government collecting taxes, where you have to do as you're told. Borrowing money requires mutual consent." He coughed, clearing his throat. A beautiful maidservant who was waiting nearby quickly knelt and presented an enamel spittoon with both hands.

Gao Ju spat, took a small striped Australian towel from another maid, wiped his mouth, and drank some hot tea.

"...An annual interest rate of thirteen percent. If there was a three-hundred-thousand-tael loan available at that rate, I, Gao, would want to borrow it myself."

He Chengzong knew Gao Ju found the interest rate too low. He became alert and cautiously asked, "What annual interest rate does Master Gao think is appropriate?"

"To be honest with you, my brother," Gao Ju said, "among our peers, even in the off-season, the annual interest rate is between twenty and twenty-four percent. Since this is for the sake of His Excellency the Governor, eighteen percent is the minimum."

Gao Ju then stated his requirements: a one-year term, interest-only payments for the first six months, and then monthly principal repayments in six installments for the latter half of the year, with the loan fully paid off by the 12th month.

Though it was called a one-year loan, principal and interest payments would begin in the seventh month, making the effective interest rate much higher than a lump-sum repayment at maturity.

However, this condition was well-suited to the government's financial situation. He Chengzong knew it was impossible for the Guangdong government to produce four hundred and seventy thousand taels of silver at once. Paying in smaller installments would be easier.

"This is feasible," He Chengzong nodded. "But this still requires the governor's approval."

"Naturally," Gao Ju nodded and asked, "What will be used for repayment?"

"Of course, it will come from the autumn tax. A small surcharge on each mu of land will cover it. If Master Gao tells the merchants this, will they not trust the entire province's land tax as collateral?"

Gao Ju sighed. "Brother He! You truly have a scholar's view. When borrowing money, you need a written contract and collateral. How can people lend money based on your word alone?"

He Chengzong was at a loss. In his view, wasn't the governor's word enough? In Guangdong province, there were few whose words were worth ten thousand.

"Is the governor's office's credit not good enough?"

"Of course, it is. But what about the proof?" Seeing that he was not getting the point, Gao Ju had to be blunt. "His Excellency Li is working day and night for the benefit of the entire province. What if he gets busy and forgets about this matter? Wouldn't we lenders have to hang ourselves?"

He Chengzong was speechless. It was not unheard of for officials to default on debts and break their word.

"...Even with a loan agreement, we still need some collateral," Gao Ju said with a smile. "What if His Excellency Li is promoted one day, and a new official is appointed before the money is repaid? If the new official says, 'I didn't borrow this money, it's not my problem,' we'd all have to hang ourselves again."

He Chengzong knew Gao Ju was right, but he was in a difficult position regarding the loan agreement and collateral. It was unheard of for the governor's office to issue a loan agreement. If one or two of them fell into the hands of a censor, Governor Li would surely be in deep trouble.

Gao Ju knew that a loan agreement was probably out of the question. Fortunately, he had another plan.

"A loan agreement from the governor's office would be the best guarantee, of course. But having collateral is enough."

The collateral Gao Ju proposed was salt licenses. The number of licenses would be equivalent to the principal and interest, with some extra salt weight added for transportation and sales costs, and would be given to the lending merchants as a one-time payment. Salt licenses were the government's most reputable securities. Merchants would definitely accept them as collateral.

"The salt licenses can be used immediately upon receipt, or they can be resold privately. What if unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to resell them?"

"That's not difficult. We can just stamp the salt licenses with a date: 'usable only after a certain year, month, and day'—that date being the final repayment date," Gao Ju said. "At the time of repayment, they can just bring the salt licenses for redemption."

"This is an excellent method." He Chengzong was convinced. This Gao Ju really had some tricks up his sleeve. He Chengzong was not a pedantic scholar—otherwise, he wouldn't have become a trusted advisor to the governor—he just knew very little about the ways of business. With a little guidance from Gao Ju, he could understand and build upon the idea. The two sides talked secretly for several hours and finally reached an agreement.

This agreement was not written down as a draft treaty, nor were any minutes taken, but they both gave their word that there would be no going back on the verbal agreement. The agreed-upon methods and conditions were:

First, the total loan amount would be four hundred thousand taels of treasury silver, with Gao Ju taking the lead in soliciting merchants to provide the loan.

Second, the annual interest rate would be eighteen percent, with only interest paid for the first six months, and then the principal repaid monthly for the latter six months, with the loan fully cleared in one year.

Third, the loan would be collateralized by an equivalent value of salt licenses issued by the governor's office, with an additional 3% premium. The salt licenses would be stamped with a time limit and returned to the governor's office monthly according to the principal and interest repayment schedule.

These three conditions were to be reported back to Li Fengjie by He Chengzong. When Li Fengjie heard about using salt licenses as collateral, he thought to himself that Gao Ju really had some clever ideas, and he agreed to all of them.

Raising the silver would take some time. Fearing another rocket attack from the Australians, Li Fengjie ordered an advance of one hundred thousand taels from the provincial treasury. It was delivered by a special envoy under the cover of night to the Australian camp. Little Hat Yan accompanied them to request a three-day extension from Wen and Chen to gather the rest of the money.
