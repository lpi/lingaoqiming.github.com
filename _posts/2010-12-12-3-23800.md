Zhou Qi was his eldest apprentice and should have been the most reliable person. But Chen Minggang was a very harsh man. Zhou Qi's parents had long since passed away. According to the customs of the old era, Chen Minggang was his closest elder, with not only the duty to care for him but also the responsibility to arrange his marriage.

However, Chen Minggang had never arranged a marriage for him. In Ming dynasty Lingao, the gender ratio was severely imbalanced. Most of the immigrant men were bachelors, and women were extremely scarce, making the cost of marriage much higher than on the mainland. Moreover, given Zhou Qi's status as his apprentice, he couldn't just marry any woman; it should be the daughter of a relatively well-off small landowner or a fellow yamen runner. This required a decent betrothal gift and a house for them to start a family.

Chen Minggang was unwilling to spend this money and had been dragging his feet. In the blink of an eye, Zhou Qi was almost thirty—in the 17th century, he was already considered an old bachelor.

Remaining unmarried for so long was a matter of great shame for Zhou Qi. It also had another consequence. Chen Minggang was a great lecher, and as his eldest apprentice, Zhou Qi often had to handle many of his master's private affairs. With frequent contact with his master's women, it was inevitable that the master would become suspicious—after all, the apprentice was young and strong, much more so than himself.

Recently, there had been rumors, either saying he was having an affair with one of Chen Minggang's women or that he harbored great resentment behind his back. Although Chen Minggang didn't fully believe them, his trust in him had diminished. The recent incident with Qiuhong further raised his doubts about his eldest apprentice's competence.

"That's right, Little Hu is correct. This kind of thing must have a pretext, to force the large households to agree. We are just following orders; they can't blame us," Chen Minggang said. "The role of the villain, naturally, should be played by them."

Everyone nodded in agreement, and some even threw in a few words of flattery.

"But what kind of pretext should we use?" someone asked. "It's not easy to find one."

First, the common people had to believe it. And these "common people" were not ignorant villagers, but landlords and gentry with some property and status who wouldn't be intimidated by empty words. Second, the Australians had to acknowledge it. Chen Minggang knew the Australians were very concerned about their image and hated it when people used their name without permission.

Chen Minggang calmly took a sip of tea. He felt he was superior to this group not only because he had the ancestral treasure of the Fish-Scale Register, but also because he could see farther and more clearly than everyone else.

"You've all come from the countryside. What have the Australian work teams been busy with?" he suddenly asked.

Everyone started talking at once. The work teams were indeed busy with many things in the countryside, mainly social surveys: population, land quantity, soil fertility. They were also helping villages establish militias and build stockades, as well as providing medical care and medicine.

"None of you have gotten to the point," Chen Minggang said, shaking his head. "What the Australians care about most is finding out the true state of this county!"

Everyone looked at each other: the true state of the county?

One of the more experienced men figured it out: "The population, the amount of land..."

"Correct, that's it," Chen Minggang nodded. "The Australians want to stay in Lingao for the long term. What do they need to know?" He tapped his palm with his fan, listing the points. "First, they need to know how many people are in the county, how much land there is, and what the land produces."

"A land survey?!" Little Hu from the umbrella shop blurted out.

"Correct!" Chen Minggang looked at Little Hu with approval. "The Australians are sending work teams to the countryside and taking on the grain tax in the county. At its root, it's all about figuring out how much 'oil' there is to squeeze from Lingao." He snapped his fan open and began to wave it gently. "We will help them with this task. We'll conduct a land survey!"

This caused an uproar. A "land survey" (丈田, zhàngtián), as the name suggested, meant measuring the fields, but it was more than that. It also involved creating a new Fish-Scale Register and re-registering land ownership and tax status. This was no small matter in ancient society; it often required the court to take the lead. In the history of the Great Ming, apart from the land survey and creation of the Fish-Scale Register during the Hongwu era, the only other one was conducted during the early Wanli era when Zhang Juzheng was in power. Each land survey not only required special officials to be dispatched from the Ministry of Revenue and the province but also required the assistance of scholars from across the province. It couldn't be completed in a month or two; it took at least half a year.

Although this group of men "ate from the grain tax," and knew a little about how to conduct a land survey, they were not professionals. It was beyond their capabilities, and there wasn't enough time.

Chen Minggang gestured for them to be quiet. "What are you all shouting about? This is just a pretext!" he sneered. "Are we really going to help them survey the land? Even if we were willing, we don't have the ability, do we?"

Everyone nodded, looking at their leader.

"The Australians want to know Lingao's resources, so we'll accommodate them. We'll say we're helping them measure the land—the Australians won't refuse. Once we have this pretext, won't the large households be at our mercy?"

The crowd roared with approval. This was a brilliant idea. Not only did it give them a legitimate reason, but the Australians would absolutely not refuse the proposal. They would be happy to play the "villain." And in the end, the large households would have nothing to say; the consequences could all be blamed on the Australians.

"Will the large households buy it?" Zhou Qi hesitated. "They also have connections with the Australians."

"Connections don't matter," Chen Minggang said, seeing the relationship between the transmigrators and the gentry very clearly. "The Australians don't like the gentry. They are just using them for now."

"A bit unexpected, isn't it?" Xiong Buyou said with a smile in Wu De's office as he relayed Chen Minggang's proposal.

"Yes, it really is unexpected," Wu De nodded, filled with emotion. "I didn't think it would be Chen Minggang who saw through our intentions so clearly. The scholars of the county, on the other hand, are all clueless." His words carried a sense of mutual appreciation.

According to Wu De's original plan, he was going to let Chen Minggang add exorbitant surcharges, causing widespread resentment among the gentry and commoners. Once most of the county's taxes were collected, he would stage a "petition" drama with an angry crowd. Finally, the transmigrator group would step in as the "righteous officials," deal with Chen Minggang and his underlings to appease the public anger.

After venting the public's anger, they would use the opportunity to promote their "new policies"—under the pretext of preventing such incidents in the future, they would begin a county-wide land survey, assess tax rates, and complete the tax system reform.

Wu De also had a backup plan. If any accidents occurred during the tax collection process that prevented the autumn levy from being collected on time, he had already obtained the Executive Committee's approval to pay it on their behalf. The transmigrator group would advance the autumn grain and taxes and then slowly deduct it from future tax revenues.

Regardless of which method was used, the transmigrator group was confident they could pay this year's autumn levy in full and on time. This would allow them to leisurely conduct the land survey and clean up the household registers, rather than rushing to do these things under the pressure of a tax deadline. As the saying goes, "slow work yields fine results." Wu De planned to slowly simmer this "new tax system" porridge.

This was a huge project for the transmigrator group. The Executive Committee had already issued several orders to various committees, bureaus, and companies.

The Leizhou Sugar Company received instructions to continue selling sugar to Vietnam and, at the same time, to sell other goods needed locally to purchase large quantities of Vietnamese rice.

The order to the Maritime Forces Department was to concentrate their transport capacity to rush the Vietnamese rice to Lingao, aiming to increase the reserve of unpolished rice in Lingao to thirty-five thousand shi before the eleventh lunar month.

The instruction to the Foreign Trade Committee was to use the Vietnamese rice to purchase ten thousand taels of silver in the three counties of Leizhou. This silver was prepared for Lingao's "Liao Sarvice" tax. Wu De predicted that the price of rice in Lingao would fall due to the collection of the "Liao Sarvice" tax. They could then use the silver obtained from selling rice at high prices to buy grain at low prices.

The instruction to the Ministry of Education was to immediately arrange courses on surveying, mapping, and simple plane geometry in the students' practical classes to prepare manpower for the comprehensive land survey.

The printing factory also received a notice: immediately print a large number of blank land deeds and property registration books.

...

"Chen Minggang is truly a talent," Xiong Buyou said.

"A pity this talent cannot be kept," Wu De couldn't help but look at this "corrupt clerk" with new eyes. The historians' claim that the grassroots of the Ming and Qing dynasties were actually governed by "clerk-rule" was indeed true.

Xiong Buyou said, "How should I reply to him?"

"Hint that he can proceed. You must show great interest in the land survey." Wu De decided to let Chen Minggang stir up trouble on this issue. It would also serve as a trial balloon for the local gentry. Just as before rolling out any new policy, they would first release a harsh version to test the waters, let public opinion criticize it, and then quietly introduce a slightly improved version, which would be more easily accepted by the masses. Wu De decided to do the same.

"But you absolutely cannot state it explicitly," Wu De instructed. "Your conversation with him must be videotaped. You need to say a lot of ambiguous things. Discuss with the propaganda department first how to conduct the conversation, so it will be easy to edit the footage later. We need to make him appear to be the one strongly recommending we conduct the land survey—"

"I understand," Xiong Buyou nodded.

"Chen Minggang is just planning to have us be the villains so he can get rich. We could have been the villains ourselves," Wu De said with some regret. "If he were really willing to put in the effort and honestly help us with the land survey."

"Hahahaha, that would be like asking a tiger for its skin," Xiong Buyou, having had much contact with the clerks, knew their character well. "They are just a bunch of parasites on the system, only thinking about how to benefit themselves. How could they have such high consciousness!"

"There's one more thing. Chen Minggang asked us where the grain collection counters should be set up, and how many of our people should be at the counters."

"The counters will still be set up in the county," Wu De had already thought it through. "We won't send any of our people. Let them do it as usual," Wu De said. "Since they're going to be the scapegoats, let them be complete scapegoats."
