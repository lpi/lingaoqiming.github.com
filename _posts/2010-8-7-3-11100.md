"Money is a worldly possession," Xin Nari cursed Zhao Dachong inwardly as a "country bumpkin" and "yokel," only seeing the few coins in front of him. He patiently persuaded, "As long as we can keep the team together, how much money we want in the future is just a matter of a word?" He counted on his fingers, "Don't complain about the many uses for money. If you want Liu Si to do a job that could cost him his head, you have to give him enough money to buy his life! And my brothers here, without a few coins to reward them, will they be willing to fight?"

"What?! A few brats still need to be rewarded..."

"Hush!" Zhao Haixie quickly stopped Zhao Dachong and whispered斥, "The men Fourth Master Xin brought are all brothers who have nothing to do with our old Thirteen Villages!"

"That's right!" Xin Nari said, "I've only been their leader for a few days. Why should I expect them to charge into battle for me?"

"Alright." Although Zhao Dachong felt reluctant, he still agreed.

"Finally, what about the families of our men in the village? Have they been given any compensation?"

"The families of the dead have all been given a few taels of silver," Zhao Dachong became alert. "Do we have to give more?"

"That's not necessary, but if you haven't given any, you must!" Xin Nari was relieved to see that he hadn't made a muddle of things. "You rest now and leave tonight. Go back and get everything ready for me and send it to this place..."

The next day, as soon as it got dark, the night enveloped the mountains. The stars twinkled with a cold light, occasionally obscured by dark clouds. It was even darker in the deep mountains. The band of bandits hiding in the mountain gully only began to move at this time.

The bandits had been on the run for many days. They were all in rags, disheveled, and pale. They looked less like bandits and more like a group of starving refugees. But they were all holding various weapons. Some who had no swords or spears had sharpened a wooden stick to carry.

Xin Nari and his men had been hiding in the mountains for the past few days, living on half-empty stomachs and anxiously waiting for news. They dared not leave the mountains. The villages, which used to be a source of food, lodging, and women, had suddenly become like hedgehogs. At any moment, they could attract the hard-to-shake-off bandit suppression teams. Now that Xin Nari had suddenly led everyone out, the bandits didn't know where this new leader was taking them or what they were going to do. But they dared not speak and each had their own thoughts. After passing through a dense forest, Xin Nari calculated the distance. They would definitely reach the meeting point before dawn. He waved for everyone to stop and announced that they were going to Daolu Village.

When the bandits heard that they could immediately set off for the Thirteen Villages area, where there would be someone to meet them and provide food, they all cheered for a while. Xin Nari took the opportunity to say:

"You can have food and women! When we get there, everyone will get a reward!" He paused. "There are only two female short-hairs in the village, plus seven or eight soldiers. Let's go all out and wipe them out!"

Hearing that they had to fight the short-hairs again, the bandits began to murmur among themselves. Xin Nari quickly encouraged them, "Brothers, don't worry! We have an inside man with the Australians. Their bird-guns won't even fire! Defeat the Australians, and we'll eat, drink, and be merry in the village for three days!"

The last sentence was tantamount to a big holiday, where they could loot whatever they wanted and play with any woman they wanted. The bandits had not had such a day for a long time, and a small commotion immediately arose in the crowd. Someone shouted, "Boss Xin, stop wasting your breath and take us there!"

"Alright, let's go!"

They arrived outside Daolu Village before dawn. Xin Nari carefully hid the troops in the mountain forest a few miles away. Zhao Dachong and Zhao Haixie had already arrived in the village earlier and had mobilized the bandits' families to cook, boil water, and secretly deliver it to the forest.

When the bandits saw the food, they all rushed forward to grab it—they hadn't had a decent meal in many days, and the lack of salt made their bodies feel tired and weak all the time. Xin Nari ordered that each person be given a tael of silver and told them to go to sleep and rest first.

Zhao Dachong, Zhao Haixie, and Zhao Haiji were all waiting for him. The four of them gathered together to discuss how to proceed.

"Old Man Mei said that the two women haven't left yet, but six or seven of the guards have already gone. I heard they went to pick up the new captain."

"Now there are only twelve or thirteen guards left. With just two more women, it's no big deal!" Xin Nari was a little more confident. "How's the plan to bribe Liu Si to sabotage the ammunition?"

"That cost a lot of money," Zhao Dachong said with a heartache. "This kid put on airs at first, saying it was difficult to sabotage the ammunition. The soldiers' ammunition pouches never leave their bodies. There are sentries on duty at night, so there's no chance at all."

"What happened then?"

"We promised him more silver and also said we'd give him Xin Nachun..." Zhao Dachong spoke without thinking, not noticing the look Zhao Haixie was giving him.

Xin Nari, however, remained calm. "He agreed."

"He agreed, but not firmly." Zhao Haiji was afraid that this master would say something rash again, like "slut," and anger Xin Nari, so he quickly interjected, "He said it's not possible to sabotage the ammunition, but he can sabotage the guns and make them misfire."

Xin Nari thought: if he agreed without being firm, it might be true. If this Liu Si had readily agreed and beaten his chest, he would have to think carefully.

"Actually, what we promise him is just a word!" Zhao Haiji said, "After the matter is done, we'll just—" he made a chopping motion.

When a person is dead, they naturally don't need silver or women.

"No," Xin Nari immediately objected. "We must keep Liu Si. We must give him everything we promised, not a single thing less."

"Why?" Zhao Dachong shouted. He had long planned to kill Liu Si after the matter was done, not for Xin Nachun, but because the property promised to Liu Si was quite substantial—he was heartbroken.

"Liu Si was personally trained by the Australians. He knows a lot about their background," Xin Nari had been thinking about this for days. "From the looks of it, the Australians won't be leaving anytime soon. If we want to deal with them, we need this person to lead the way!"

Zhao Haixie nodded, "Fourth Master Xin is right. We don't need to be too stingy about this. Let's get him to join us!"

Zhao Dachong had no choice but to agree.

"Tell me how you plan to do it," Xin Nari said.

"Liu Si said he can get the ammunition sorted out before noon. We'll make our move at noon," Zhao Haixie said. "It's hot in the afternoon, so most of them will be taking a nap. We'll rush into the ancestral hall and catch them by surprise."

"How are the families? Are they all ready?"

"More than sixty people came at once. They all want revenge on the Australians. Even the women have brought their scissors," Zhao Dachong said excitedly. "I've persuaded the very old and the very young to go back."

"The families should not go into battle," Xin Nari thought for a moment. "Choose a few who are familiar with the roads and are fast on their feet to meet us at the village entrance and lead the way. The others will block the roads at the village entrance and around to prevent anyone from escaping."

"Alright!" everyone agreed.

"Also, all our families' doors should have a blue cloth strip hanging on them," Xin Nari said. "My brothers now are not from this village. It would be embarrassing if they accidentally clashed with our own people."

"That's easy. I'll inform all the families as soon as I get back," Zhao Haixie said.

"Who will be in charge of opening the gate of the ancestral hall?"

"It's been decided. Liu Si will be at the front gate, and Old Man Mei will be at the back gate," Zhao Dachong said. "I've promised Old Man Mei land and silver."

"That old man is still quite agile," Xin Nari nodded. "We don't need to keep him."

"We will use three skyrockets as a signal, and all sides will attack at the same time!" Xin Nari's expression changed, becoming murderous. Zhao Dachong, who had been calculating how to become the leader in the future, couldn't help but feel a chill. Seeing that his own clan's elders were all obedient to this outsider, he had great doubts about whether he could become the leader in the future.

"Damn it, you can't stay either!" Zhao Dachong glared fiercely at Xin Nari, who was going to give instructions to his men. He touched the small dagger in his bosom, already having murderous intent.

Just after noon, a dark, turbid stream of people was running wildly on the dirt road three miles away. More than fifty ragged bandits, waving their rusty swords and spears, rushed towards Daolu Village.

The bandits did not shout, but just ran wildly. At the entrance of the village, some half-grown boys or young women with white flowers in their hair were already waiting, holding newly sharpened wooden sticks with white tips, to meet the bandits and rush towards the ancestral hall. Although they were silent, their eyes were all burning with fire. Some were driven by greed, while others were driven purely by hatred.

There were originally a few people doing chores and chatting on the street. Seeing this scene, they were all stunned and ran back to their houses, closing the doors and trembling as they listened to the commotion outside.

The gate of the ancestral hall was indeed open as planned. Liu Si was anxiously poking his head out from the side of the door, looking around. When he saw them coming, his expression relaxed greatly. He waved his hand and pushed the door open wider. Zhao Haixie was the first to jump up the steps.

"How is it?"

"Man, it took a lot of effort to get rid of the sentry," Liu Si tilted his head. "The others are having a meeting in the back..."

Zhao Haixie ordered, "Hold the gate!" He and Zhao Dachong led the main force straight in. There was no one in the first courtyard, only some bundles, quilts, and other soldier's belongings, neatly arranged in the room.

Although the absence of anyone made him a little suspicious, he couldn't be bothered with that once he got going. Zhao Haixie broke down the gate of the second courtyard, and everyone rushed in with a loud shout.

Suddenly, many people rushed out from the back alley, shouting. They were all holding swords and spears and waving them as they charged over. Both sides were stunned when they saw each other.

This was the group led by Xin Nari that had rushed in from the back gate!

Xin Nari led the men attacking the backyard and entered the church smoothly through the open door. In the church, besides Old Man Mei, there were a few other old people who often came. They were all so scared that they couldn't move. Xin Nari had no time to deal with them and led his men straight into the second courtyard. Unexpectedly, the people he met head-on were the ones who had entered from the front gate.

The entire second courtyard was empty. Not to mention the work team, there wasn't even a ghost.

Just as Zhao Haixie was about to lead his men to search the rooms, a volley of gunfire suddenly came from the street outside.

The sound of the deadly whistle made him shudder. When he looked for Liu Si again, he was gone!

"It's a trap!" Zhao Haixie couldn't help but shout, "Run—"

His men were immediately thrown into chaos. Some ran forward, some ran back, and some directly climbed the walls. The entire courtyard was in a state of utter chaos.

On the roof, a dozen or so soldiers had climbed up, and their rifles were firing into the courtyard in volleys. Xin Nari didn't even have time to shout "it's a trap" before the other side had already fired the first volley. Five or six of the bandits around him had already fallen, and the rest turned and fled. Then, countless grenades were thrown down. Iron and porcelain fragments flew around the courtyard—the bandits, covered in blood, groaned in pain on the ground. The bandit gang had completely lost its order. The sound of gunfire and explosions rose and fell one after another.

Xin Nari was quick to react. He had already retreated to the church in the third courtyard. It was empty now. The bandits who were supposed to be guarding the main gate were gone. The back gate was still open. He was slightly relieved and quickly waved his hand, "Run to the back gate!"

The bandits rushed out of the back gate in a chaotic swarm. "Where do you think you're going!" A female general had already appeared at the back gate. She was wearing a stab-proof vest and an M80 steel helmet, and in her hand, she held a steel spear as tall as her eyebrows. She was awe-inspiring and heroic. It was none other than Dong Weiwei! She had practiced bodybuilding and was in excellent physical condition. In terms of both height and physique, she was much stronger than the average man of this time. She raised her spear and stabbed down a bandit who was moving the fastest.

"Brothers, let's fight to the death!" Xin Nari saw that there was only a woman guarding the gate and knew something was wrong. He just waved his saber and incited the surviving bandits around him to howl and charge forward in a swarm, trying to kill their way through and escape through the gate. A row of soldiers had already appeared behind Dong Weiwei. They fired another volley, followed by a burst of shotgun fire. The courtyard was immediately littered with corpses and wounded.

However, Xin Nari did not charge with his men. Taking advantage of the chaos, he slipped to the side, ran into the alley, and quickly climbed over the wall, escaping the trap.

He didn't care how many of his brothers could escape. He just ran straight out of the village—he couldn't stay in the village, it was important to get away.

On the road, he met Zhao Dachong, who was supposed to be providing support on the street. He was also covered in black gunpowder smoke and was waving a precious sword.

"It's a trap, damn it!" Zhao Dachong cursed, "That bastard Liu Si, I'm going to skin him alive—"

"Let's go, what's the point of saying that!" Xin Nari couldn't be bothered with Liu Si or Liu Wu anymore and left him to run for his life.

The battle ended quickly. Zhao Haiji, Zhao Haixie, and Zhao Dachong were all killed. Xin Nachun, who was originally leading a dozen or so bandit families on the street to provide support, rolled on the ground and played dead after a few people were hit by the sudden random shots of the soldiers. When the battlefield was being cleared, she was kicked several times before she reluctantly got up and was tied up with the other prisoners with a rope. Of the fifty or so men brought by Xin Nari, and the more than thirty bandit families mobilized by Zhao Dachong in the village, all were killed or captured. Not a single one escaped.
