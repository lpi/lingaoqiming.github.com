"In public, you disregard the distinction between men and women and embrace openly. What has become of your manners!" Hearing his servant boy dare to ask him, the master, "what for," Huang Binkun's anger flared up. He immediately put on his master's airs and reprimanded him, "You are a child of a respectable family. You must not learn the ways of those frivolous and unworthy youths!"

Huang Ping dared not talk back, but his face was full of defiance. Huang Binkun softened his tone again, "You are not young anymore. If that girl is from a respectable and good family, I will act as your matchmaker, arrange the engagement, and have you married in the next year or two."

He had expected Huang Ping to be moved to tears of gratitude, but instead, Huang Ping showed a look of shock.

"Second Young Master, absolutely not..."

"Why not?"

"Students at the school are not allowed to be engaged, let alone marry..."

"If that's the case, then why did you... act in such a way with her?" Huang Binkun said in a solemn tone. "You are a scholar now. A scholar must have a clear reputation. And the girl's reputation is also at stake."

"Second Young Master, the girl and I just have mutual feelings... We, we didn't think that far..." Huang Ping stammered.

"Then what on earth are you thinking?!" Huang Binkun was starting to get confused.

Huang Ping's face showed an expression of "I can't explain it to you." He could only say reluctantly, "She and I are just friends. We like each other very much..."

Huang Binkun felt the amount of information was a bit overwhelming. He racked his brains for a long time before finding a descriptor: "So she's your bosom buddy?"

"I suppose that's what it means," Huang Ping said, relieved.

"What kind of family is she from?" Huang Binkun pressed on.

Huang Ping said helplessly, "She's from a naturalized citizen family. Her family is from Guangdong, and now her parents both work on the Agricultural Committee's farms..."

Hearing that the girl's parents were not of some lowly origin but from a respectable farming family, Huang Binkun felt a little relieved. He said sternly:

"Since you are unwilling to be engaged to her, you must never again act so rashly in public!" Huang Binkun taught earnestly.

Huang Ping could only reply, "Yes, I understand."

Huang Binkun returned to Huang Family Village, only to learn that his own father had just decided to contract out the approximately one thousand mu of marginal land under the Huang family's name to the Heaven and Earth Society. This news shocked him. What shocked him even more was that his father had consequently disbanded the village militia of Huang Family Village.

As a gesture of cooperation, the Huang family had already purchased the agricultural technology services of the Heaven and Earth Society last year. Although the initial intention was merely to feign compliance and buy peace, the Heaven and Earth Society's services last year had more than doubled the Huang family's income. This made the old master Huang and the eldest young master, who had been wary of the Heaven and Earth Society's intentions and motives, take an interest in it. The two discussed that they had nearly a thousand mu of marginal land under their name. Renting it out to tenant farmers yielded almost no rent. If they insisted on collecting rent, the tenants would probably starve to death. And the tenants of Huang Family Village were the main source of the village militia, so the Huang family was naturally unwilling to offend them too much.

Now that the situation in Lingao had become clear and public order was good, there was no need for the Huang family to continue spending a great deal of manpower and resources on "maintaining the militia." The cost of maintaining a militia of several hundred men was very high, and the entire Huang Family Village had long been groaning under the burden.

In the past, it was a necessity for "survival" in a chaotic society. Now that the bandits had been suppressed—and with the formidable existence of the Fubo Army, even the Li people dared not cause trouble—it was too uneconomical to continue spending money on a militia that far exceeded the scale of the village. Therefore, there had long been calls to disband the militia completely.

This time, old master Huang directly disbanded most of the militia, only retaining a few dozen men as the "village militia" that the short-haired bandits required every village to have, based on the village's population.

As a result, the Huang family no longer needed to continue this unprofitable endeavor just to support the militia. The Huang family's eldest young master, Huang Bingcheng, made a special trip to the Heaven and Earth Society, visited Ye Yuming, and reached a business cooperation to "fully contract" these lands and the tenant farmers on them to the Heaven and Earth Society.

When Huang Binkun heard about the disbandment of the militia and the contracting of the land, he was aghast. This was cutting off their own claws and teeth! The reason the Huang Family Village enjoyed a high status in Lingao was directly related to the fact that their family had maintained a militia for generations and had always been the "pillar" of the township. Now, by disbanding the militia and contracting out the land and tenants—did his father not know that the most important thing in Lingao was the population? These tenants were "old households" that had settled over many years, and many had fought alongside his grandfather and father. Even if there was no war, such a large population was a rare asset. How could his father suddenly become so muddle-headed?

He hurried to find his father and older brother but couldn't find them. A servant reported that the master and the eldest young master were in the flower hall meeting with Master Song from Chengmai.

This Master Song was a long-time friend of the Huang family. Not only that, he was also the father-in-law of the eldest son of the Huang family. Their relationship was not ordinary. Huang Binkun hurried to the flower hall.

In the flower hall, Village Head Song Zongmao was holding forth. He said he was just dropping by to visit his daughter and grandson, but everyone knew that Village Head Song was here for advice.

The Song family was a major clan in Chengmai County. The former richest man in Chengmai, Song Zonghui, was Song Zongmao's clan brother. Although Song Zongmao was not as rich as his clan brother, he was still a landlord of some means, with several thousand mu of land. Originally, all this land was rented out. Since the Australians defeated the government troops, established a "Reconstruction Bureau" in Chengmai County, and then set up the "Chengmai County Office" and the "Chengmai County Advisory Council," Chengmai had gradually been changing, just like Lingao.

Suppressing bandits, measuring land, registering the population, clarifying taxes, and implementing a new tax system... it was all done step by step. Although Song Zongmao had some complaints about some of the policies, Chengmai had taken on a new look, the area was peaceful, and everyone, rich or poor, lived a more stable life than before.

But the Australians' recent actions had truly thrown him into a panic. The Agricultural Committee was vigorously reclaiming wasteland and setting up farms in Chengmai, and they were recruiting farm workers in large numbers. The wages were said to be generous. Not only did the long-term and short-term laborers who used to come for just a full meal "resign," but even the tenant farmers were clamoring for rent reductions. If their rent wasn't reduced, they threatened to give up their tenancies. In the words of the tenants: "Now that the Australians are here, working for them as long-term laborers not only provides good food but also housing. It's much better than being a tenant farmer who can't get enough to eat all year round."

This uproar made Village Head Song unable to sit still any longer. Since the land measurement and the implementation of the new tax system, his tax burden had become much heavier than before. Moreover, a large amount of Australian goods had flooded into Chengmai, and his consumption expenses in this area had increased greatly. Master Song had originally wanted to raise the rent. Now, let alone raising the rent, it was a problem whether anyone would even farm his land this year.

In his desperation, Master Song thought of his in-law, who was a member of the Lingao Advisory Council. Since he was a member, he was probably close to the Australians, and Lingao was the Australians' old nest, so he came to seek advice.

"...Ai, I never thought that the fifty thousand government troops would be wiped out in a few days. When the government army came, my village also contributed a lot of money and grain, almost emptying the treasury. It was truly harmful!" Song Zongmao was holding forth in the flower hall. "That hole hasn't been filled yet. I was hoping for a few years of peace to slowly recover, but now the Australians are pulling this stunt! Are they giving us a way to live? These wicked peasants! If I hadn't taken pity on them and rented them the land, they would have starved to death long ago. Now they dare to say such unfilial and disrespectful things to my face. Truly, truly..." Song Zongmao shook his head repeatedly as he spoke.

Under the rule of the Yuanlao Senate, the burden on landlords who rented out their land was very heavy. After the comprehensive land measurement, they lost the benefits of their hidden fields. With the implementation of the new tax system, not only were the explicit tax exemptions under the Great Ming abolished, but all the various cheating and tax evasion methods they used to play by colluding with clerks were also rendered ineffective. This had already made the landlords complain incessantly. And they also had to pay a progressive agricultural tax at a higher rate according to the progressive system.

This caused many rent-collecting landlords to go bankrupt, forcing them to sell their land and move to the city to work in commerce or industry. The rest changed their ways, either subcontracting their land to the Heaven and Earth Society or transitioning to managing the land themselves.

Huang Shoutong consoled him, "This is also the general trend. Since renting out the land is so much trouble, why not just contract it to the Heaven and Earth Society? No matter how刁钻 (cunning/troublesome) the tenants are, the Australians will naturally reason with them."

"Contracting it to the Heaven and Earth Society would save a lot of trouble, but I've never dealt with them before. I don't know if they are reliable," Master Song said. His worry was whether the Heaven and Earth Society would be like some large households that, after a "voluntary offering," would turn their backs and refuse to acknowledge the agreement, stealing his land.

Huang Shoutong immediately stated that the Heaven and Earth Society was reliable. His family's cooperation with the Australians had yielded good returns, so this year he planned to contract out a large piece of land, along with the tenants on it, to the Heaven and Earth Society for cultivation.

"The Australians are trustworthy. On this point, Master Song need not worry."

After hearing Huang Shoutong's words, Master Song's mind began to race. Instead of confronting the tenants and ending up with a situation where no one benefits, contracting the land to the Heaven and Earth Society was also a way out.

He then went on to inquire about a second matter.

"I hear that the Australians have established an 'Australian Academy' in Lingao?"

"That's right, it's been running for several years. It's called Fangcao."

"I hear that many children from the gentry and prominent families of Lingao have enrolled?"

"Quite a few."

Song Zongmao hesitated and said that he had heard recently that his own clan brother, Song Zonghui, had sent a son to study in Lingao. This gave Song Zongmao a sense of crisis. Song Zonghui was already a member of the county advisory council, a favorite in the eyes of the Australians. Now that he had sent a son to study in Lingao, it was undoubtedly a gesture of sending a "hostage" to show his sincerity. He himself had not managed to become a member. If he fell behind in this aspect as well, would he still have a say in the county in the future? Although they were from the same clan, they were still distant relatives.
