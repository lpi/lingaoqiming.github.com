The *Countess Scarborough* sailed along the coast of Lin'gao Cape, slowly drifting into the bay with the tide while continuously firing its cannons. The white beams of light remained fixed on the ship; the Orientals on shore had clearly made his vessel their primary target. Cannonballs flew towards him relentlessly. Fortunately, the enemy lacked heavy artillery, and the galleon's sturdy oak hull withstood most of the impacts. Only a few cannonballs penetrated the planks. However, the shot had killed many sailors. The deck was littered with severed limbs and headless bodies, and blood flowed in the scuppers. Aragornes was reaching his limit. If this continued, he'd either have to recruit local Chinese sailors or head straight back to Manila.

"Those demonic beams of light!" Aragornes cursed. "Haven't they succeeded yet?" he asked Li Siya again. Her usually calm face was twitching slightly. Besides the Spanish firepower, Liu Xiang had invested heavily this time. The landing parties were all seasoned pirates, many of them desperadoes and deserters from the imperial navy. In her experience, the firepower of the *Countess Scarborough* was second to none on the Chinese coast. While it might not be able to annihilate Liu Xiang's fleet in a sea battle as he boasted, suppressing coastal defenses should have been no problem. Combined with this elite pirate force, capturing the ships should have been a sure thing. She never expected their meticulously crafted plan would end up no better than Zhu Cailao's.

Suddenly, a distinctly sharp whistle cut through the air. The two of them were startled as a pointed shell tore clean through the side of the ship. Splinters, blood, and chunks of flesh flew from the gaping hole, and their ears were filled with screams of agony.

"Fire!"

At Bai Yu's command, another 70mm pointed shell screamed from a cannon's muzzle. The four 70mm rifled cannons on the two retrofitted fishing trawlers had locked onto the *Countess Scarborough* and were firing in sequence. The power of the pointed, armor-piercing shells fired from the rifled cannons was several times that of round shot. No oak plank, no matter how thick, could withstand them.

The *Countess Scarborough* could finally take no more. These new shells had destroyed almost an entire side of the galleon's gunwale. Nine of the sixteen cannons were out of action, and more than half the gunners below deck were dead or wounded.

"Fire the signal flare. Retreat," Aragornes finally gave the order. Although the tide had not yet begun to ebb, making it difficult to exit the harbor, if they didn't retreat now, they might never get out. To hell with the alliance with Liu Xiang for now. If he lost the ship, which held his entire fortune, Aragornes would be penniless, facing the wrath of the Governor of Manila and the prison his creditors had prepared for him.

"Captain, we still have a few boats that haven't returned—"

"Never mind those filthy natives! Turn the rudder!"

"We don't have enough sailors for the longboats."

"Get every man who can still move to the oars!" Aragornes roared in fury. "Go now!"

Dozens of sailors slid down the ropes into the longboats. Propelled by the long oars, the Spanish galleon laboriously turned and began to retreat. Aragornes ordered the remaining functional cannons to continue firing, partly to suppress the enemy and partly to expend ammunition—the lighter the ship, the faster the escape.

"Devils!" he gritted his teeth, looking at the massive ship silhouette deep in the harbor, a profound chill seeping into his heart.

Li Siya stood beside him. She had wanted to stop Aragornes's retreat. If he fled, the few cannons on Boss Liu's five two-masted ships would be even less capable of suppressing the enemy. The ships and all the men would be buried here. But this was no time for loyalty. She casually pulled the hood of her cloak over her head and inconspicuously slipped away from the quarterdeck.

The Spanish retreat completely shattered the morale of the pirates in the bay. Two of the five two-masted ships had already been sunk by the harbor's artillery. Seeing the Spanish flee, the other three also turned to escape. As one ship was fleeing, it suddenly exploded, fire and smoke shooting into the sky. The pirates on shore were thrown into chaos. Many dropped their weapons and scrambled for the longboats and sampans on the beach. A fierce fight even broke out around the few available boats, and many were killed. The small boats, overloaded with fugitives, were difficult to control in the chaos and rocking. When the pursuing Transmigration Army reached the shore and continued firing with their rifles, some boats capsized. The sea was dotted with bobbing, struggling heads. The remaining few, seeing the situation was hopeless, fled into the nearby mangrove forest to eke out a little more time.

As the various units gradually regrouped, command and communication became smoother. A platoon sent as emergency reinforcements from Bairen City arrived. Xi Yazhou had run all the way to Bopu with his soldiers, his heart pounding, unsure of the situation at the port. On the way, he had heard the deafening roar of guns and seen the chaotic dance of searchlights, a terrifying sight. He feared the transmigrators had suffered heavy casualties.

When he arrived at the camp, he found that although the area was a wreck, after speaking with Wu De, he learned that only twenty to thirty transmigrators were injured, mostly lightly. The native laborers and soldiers, however, had suffered significant casualties.

Since it was still dark and the battle had been a confusing melee, the newly arrived units were simply stationed at various intersections and key points to prevent the enemy from escaping or launching a second attack. They would wait for daylight to make further decisions. Li Haiping suggested starting the fishing trawlers' engines to pursue the foreign ship out of the harbor, to sink or even capture it. But the consensus was that with the situation still unclear, it was better to maintain a defensive posture for now.

While they were discussing their next steps, cleaning the battlefield, and treating the wounded, they suddenly heard an uproar, followed by the sound of cannons, guns, and shouts. After about ten minutes, the sounds died down completely, replaced by an occasional scream.

It turned out the pirates huddled in the mangrove forest, seeing their situation was desperate, had attempted to break out and flee. They were met by the well-prepared marines and cannons waiting for them. They were all slaughtered, and the wounded were finished off with a bayonet.

After an hour of fierce fighting, the fires in Bopu Harbor gradually died down. Only the exploded two-masted ship still burned, drifting on the water. The surface was covered with debris and corpses. Of the approximately 400 Chinese and foreign pirates who had landed, more than half would not see the next day's sun. The ground was covered with wounded, their moans and screams echoing everywhere. The medical team and nurses from the Public Health School, dispatched from Bairen City, were overwhelmed.

Wu De sent men to put out the fires while requesting laborers and necessary supplies from Bairen City to clean the battlefield. He personally visited the quarantine camp, where several hundred men, women, and children relocated from Baitu were being held. The camp had been hit by a few shells during the battle, partially destroying some buildings and causing a dozen casualties, leading to panic. Wu De reassured everyone, telling them that pirates had attacked but had been repulsed. He then had the stretcher-bearers carry the wounded out for treatment.

As dawn broke, the various units began a large-scale sweep of the surrounding area. There were few survivors left. They captured less than fifty men. The heavily wounded were spared any moral dilemmas for the transmigrators; the New Army soldiers dispatched them with a bayonet each. Only those who could walk to the dressing station on their own were allowed to live.

The members of the Executive Committee, escorted by marines, inspected the beach. After a night of vicious fighting, everyone felt a sense of having survived a great disaster. Many looked pale. On the whole, fewer people were vomiting compared to after the first time they repelled the county's attack. It seemed everyone was gradually getting used to the bloodshed. The New Army soldiers, on the other hand, though it was the first battle for most of them, were unfazed by the gore. People in this era had seen too much death and were long accustomed to it.

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] walked among the men, making small talk to boost their morale. In his view, a battle of this intensity was just the beginning. More severe tests awaited them.

"Commissioner Ma, the battle statistics are out," a member of the Planning Committee reported. Their work was always known for its precision, efficiency, and ruthlessness.

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] glanced at the report and addressed the crowd, "This battle... we've suffered a serious loss."

The crowd was floored by his comment.

"Don't look so amused," [Ma Qianzhu][y005] said irritably, slapping the folder in his hand. "Do you all think the few hundred flimsy swords, a handful of matchlocks, and a dozen leaky sampans we captured can offset the 1,900 rounds of ammunition, 214 artillery shells, and several hundred kilograms of gunpowder we expended?" He added a final sentence, "20 New Army soldiers and 15 laborers dead. 10 more permanently disabled from severe injuries."

The final casualty figures were indeed shocking. The New Army soldiers were the seeds of their future army, carefully trained. To lose them was heartbreaking. The laborers could at least speak some Mandarin, were adapted to the work here, and had established a basic level of trust.

"Those damned pirates!" Li Haiping cursed, his heart aching over the heavy losses his marines had suffered.

"You guys just had to train your own marines, didn't you? Not enough training, huh? Land battles still depend on—"

Before Wei Aiwen could finish his sentence, the navy men glared at him, looking ready to eat him alive.

Xi Yazhou, seeing a brawl was imminent, quickly interjected, "What's the use of saying all this now? Let's review the battle properly, patch up the loopholes, and figure out what to do next."

"The marines need to be expanded to at least two companies," Li Haiping immediately proposed. "The defense of Bopu is too heavy a task, the posts are too spread out, and we also have to man the batteries."

[Ma Qianzhu][y005] stopped Wei Aiwen from speaking again. "The navy's vacancies must be filled immediately. The issue of military expansion needs comprehensive consideration. Let's first discuss the defense of Bopu."

Bopu's defenses were still weak. There were too few batteries and not enough heavy cannons. The Lin'gao Beacon Tower had proven its immense value in the battle, not only providing a commanding view of the entire battlefield and allowing for real-time reporting of enemy movements, but its searchlight also served as excellent battlefield illumination. In contrast, the 12-pounder cannon on it had a limited effect. The artillery team believed that the cannons on the tower should be at least 24-pounders. The few heavy cannons cast by the transmigrators couldn't be hoisted onto the beacon tower due to lifting capacity limitations and were instead mounted on temporary emplacements next to the pier. It turned out that these hastily built emplacements had poor defenses and lacked sufficient infantry cover. They were quickly overrun by the enemy, and the dozen marines defending them were all killed, resulting in the largest number of casualties in this battle.

The 12-pounder mountain howitzer once again demonstrated its great value. Its mobility, allowing it to be dragged around by just three or four men, made it the transmigrators' most reliable area-denial weapon. Lin Shenhe pointed out that if they had deployed one or two mountain howitzers next to the temporary emplacements, the forts might not have fallen so quickly.

Li Di, Bai Yu, and other gunners also pointed out that the variety of ammunition was too limited. Solid shot had limited effect on enemy ships, and canister shot was only effective at close range.

"If we don't have high-explosive shells, we should at least have incendiary rounds. Oh, right, and chain-shot."

"Yeah, if we had chain-shot, we could have taken out the Spanish galleon's masts this time—it wouldn't have gotten away!"

"Primitive incendiary rounds aren't hard to make, are they? Just a red-hot iron ball. That would be good to have, at least it could set the ships on fire."

"Besides cannons, the harbor itself needs other defensive measures," Li Haiping suggested. "Can we make some sea mines? I know command-detonated mines are a bit difficult, but what about contact mines? The technical difficulty shouldn't be that high, right?"

"It's not small either," Lin Shenhe shook his head. "Contact mines need an electrical switch for detonation—that part is manageable, we can use light bulbs, we have enough stock. But the amount of wire required would be huge. Relatively speaking, command-detonated mines are easier to make. Let's focus our efforts on that."

After discussion, they decided to build two more three-story brick-and-cement gun batteries next to the pier. The tall hull of the *Fengcheng* could also serve a role similar to the Bopu Beacon Tower in the harbor. The Executive Committee decided to add one or two revolving heavy cannons on it. They would also consider setting up some kind of blockade at the harbor entrance.
