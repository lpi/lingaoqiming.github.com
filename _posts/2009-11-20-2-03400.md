When [Wang Luobin][y003] walked out of the administrative area, his heart was still pounding. To calm himself down, he kept dragging his rifle. Today was really dangerous! He had been busy with construction on the site, and his body was exhausted when the enemy came so quickly!

Although he had fired a full magazine during the battle, he didn't know what he had hit. He had fired all 30 rounds in a short time, and seeing that the enemy was about to climb over the earthen rampart, he didn't have time to reload—he panicked and shamefully ran away. The whole process was like a dream he had in the morning, chaotic and fragmented. Anyway, when he was clear-headed, the enemy had already retreated. He himself had also moved from one side of the front line to the other. Fortunately, he only had a few scratches... He didn't know if he could survive in the future...

The ground was littered with messy shell casings, some of which were still smoking—what a waste. The transmigrators couldn't make shell casings in a short time. They should organize people to pick them up in time.

As he was thinking, he saw [Xiao Zishan][y001] standing on the earthen rampart, looking at the corpses on the ground with a disgusted expression.

"[Zishan][y001], why are you here?" he asked.

"Aren't we arranging the funeral arrangements?" [Xiao Zishan][y001] tried to force a calm smile, but he still showed a look of wanting to vomit. "To be honest, I'm most afraid of seeing dead people..."

"No one likes it, right?" [Wang Luobin][y003] also tried his best not to look at the corpses with all kinds of strange death postures. Obviously, even people killed by bullets did not just have a small hole elegantly left on their bodies and a symbolic pool of blood as in the movies, but unceremoniously turned out a pile of flesh and blood, and a large amount of blood flowed out, dyeing the land purple-black—it was hard to imagine that people had so much blood without seeing it with one's own eyes...

A corpse not far away was lying crookedly on the ground, with half of its skull missing, exposing white and red things. The cotton armor on its body was riddled with several bullets, and the blood-stained broken cotton wadding trembled in the wind. [Wang Luobin][y003] quickly turned his head away. The temporarily organized corpse collection team, using the grappling hooks they had brought to pull down the barbed wire fence, dragged the corpses out, threw them one by one onto the wheelbarrows, and pulled them to a distant place to be buried.

Looking at these captives, with numb faces, carrying and dragging the corpses, the transmigrators watched with gloomy faces. "Revolution is not a dinner party, not writing an essay." In the past, this was just a line from a song that was said as a joke. At this time and place, it made them fully understand the coldness in it. Revolution is bloodshed and sacrifice. Revolution, no matter how it conforms to the will of heaven and the hearts of the people, in the end, the ones who die the most are the ordinary people.

"By the way, [Engineer Wang][y003], the Executive Committee will hold an enlarged meeting at 7 pm."

"Enlarged meeting?"

"Yes, it's a post-war review meeting. In addition to the executive committee members, there are also the leaders of various professional groups and some key members. By the way, representatives of the masses will also participate."

"Representatives of the masses?"

"Yes." [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a cold face, "I think there will probably be the first line struggle tonight."

"What? Didn't we fight well?" In [Engineer Wang][y003]'s opinion, although this battle was a bit embarrassing, the results were still very good, and their own losses were minimal.

"Things have to be looked at from two sides," [Xiao Zishan][y001] looked around and lowered his voice. "We have such a great technological advantage, and our weapons are hundreds of years more advanced than theirs, but we were actually broken into the base by the Ming army. Isn't this a mistake?"

"Indeed..."

"This place is only four kilometers away from the enemy's stronghold. The Executive Committee turned a blind eye to the imminent threat and only sent three people to monitor. Isn't this underestimating the enemy?"

"Yes, yes." [Wang Luobin][y003] nodded repeatedly.

"When we found that the enemy had left the city, we didn't organize troops to actively harass and attack them, but sat and waited for them to besiege us. What kind of behavior is this?"

[Wang Luobin][y003] broke out in a cold sweat: "[Zishan][y001], you are trying to frame someone."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] shook his head: "After we landed, we have always pursued a steady construction flow and tried our best to avoid direct conflict with the natives of the Ming Dynasty. But now it seems that the radical line is about to come to power."

"Impossible, the basic ideas in the Executive Committee are all the same."

"It's normal for the leading group to be in harmony. That's why we are holding an enlarged meeting." [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a gloomy face, "Do you know what the professional group leaders, technical backbones, and representatives of the masses think?"

[Wang Luobin][y003] thought for a moment and said, "No matter what everyone says, I will stick to a steady style and firmly support [Wen Zong][y002]'s ideas." He suddenly laughed and patted [Xiao Zishan][y001]'s shoulder, "You are too much of a conspiracy theorist, you always think of everything in terms of political struggle..."

While [Xiao Zishan][y001] and [Wang Luobin][y003] were talking nonsense in a sneaky way, the people in the medical team were busy in the tent. The sound of screams was one after another. Because they were reluctant to use anesthetics, most of the wounded had their wounds cleaned and foreign objects removed while they were conscious. Some were fine with a little medicine, while others had to be stitched up.

Most people were lightly injured, but many were injured in the face, so they looked particularly scary with their faces covered in blood. Many people were in a faint when they were carried in, which scared the doctors enough. But after a careful examination, it was all caused by tension and fear, and no one was due to excessive blood loss. The doctors used self-made saline to clean the wounds, then disinfected them with alcohol, removed all kinds of foreign objects, and sutured the wounds.

The bacteria in this time and space had no drug resistance, so they only used sulfanilamide ointment for anti-infection treatment. Some people also had to be injected with tetanus shots.

"Okay, all your iron sand has been removed." Dr. Lan comforted a poor guy. He had spent more than an hour pulling out 20 small fragments from his face one by one. Some looked like broken coins, and it was hard to know what the other things were originally.

"I'm going to have pockmarks. Doctor, do you know how to do plastic surgery?" the wounded man who had been crying constantly because of pain and fear asked.

Dr. Lan thought that I might be more familiar with your stomach, but for now, in order to soothe his emotions, he had to talk nonsense first: "No problem, I've worked in a beauty hospital before."

"Then I'll make an appointment first. Your skills have to be good. I'm still planning to marry a princess, let's say Ah Jiu..." At this point, Yang Baogui's wife, Zhang Ziyi (PS: this is the request of the extra himself, not my bad taste), saw that he was a little delirious and injected him with the sedative that had been prepared long ago. This person who wanted to marry a princess fell into a drowsy sleep.

But there were also people who were seriously injured. Someone had their teeth knocked out and a hole in their cheek. Fortunately, there was a dentist in the medical team, and they also had the materials and equipment for making dentures. Shi Niaoren was worried that someone might have a large maxillofacial defect wound. He was not good at repair surgery. Of the five doctors in the medical team, none of them specialized in surgery: he was in infectious diseases, Lan Fangfang was in internal medicine and gastroenterology, He Ma was an internist with a little clinical experience in orthopedics; as for Dr. Yang, no one was willing to let him see a doctor—he was a veterinarian.

The wounded captives were crowded on the ground in front of the infirmary. Few of them were wailing. Most of them were silent, bleeding silently. Some had wrapped their wounds with rags. When the pirates drove them here, they were all very frightened. Seeing that someone was constantly carrying the wounded pirates in on stretchers, and the bandaged pirates were being carried out, they probably understood that they were going to be treated, and they all quieted down.

As for when it would be their turn, they were not in a hurry at all. Chinese people have always been very patient since ancient times.

Fu Buer was also lying in this crowd. When he was running away, he only felt that he was pushed hard and fell to the ground, and then his left leg could no longer be used. It was not until he was forced to get up by the pirates with swords mounted on their matchlocks and limped here that he felt very tired and thirsty because he had run for his life. He almost fell. He knew that he could not fall. If he fell, he would be directly thrown to the side of the seriously wounded on the road. Once there, he would never be able to get up again. Fortunately, he saw that one of his long-term laborers from his village, Lin Er, was also in the team with a minor injury. He hurriedly asked him to help him, and only then did he get here.

The wounded who could walk were all sitting together. A pirate brought a few iron buckets filled with clean water. This group of people had walked all the way, and had just run wildly. They were all very thirsty now, and they all crowded around to drink water. The scene was a bit chaotic. Those with slightly more serious injuries were pushed to the ground and groaned in pain. The guards quickly drove them away, maintained order, and let everyone drink water.

Fu Buer drank some water and lay down for a while. He felt a little better. The bleeding seemed to have stopped, and his leg didn't hurt as much. He regretted that he had been bewitched to follow Huang Shoutong to fight the pirates. He had been staying well in his own village: a dozen or so tenant farmers, three or four long-term laborers. It was only because Huang Shoutong had led the local braves to help him fight off the bandits that year that he was grateful. He had also heard that this group of pirates was very strange, and he wanted to see the world, so he brought five or six people with him to "suppress the bandits." He had seen the strength of the Huang Family Village local braves, and this time he was following a large group of people, so he was very relieved.

He didn't expect to be defeated this time, and so miserably. It was only a matter of a few incense sticks of time before the whole army was routed. The pirates' firearms were too vicious! He didn't see where Huang Shoutong was. He was probably dead—after all, he was the first to charge.

There were still a dozen or so people lying in the distance, all seriously injured. They didn't even have the strength to wail, but were just groaning. Fu Buer knew that these people were hopeless. In a moment, they would either be finished off with a knife, or they would be directly taken away and buried with the dead. He couldn't help but shiver.

However, his own life seemed to be in no danger—since they were going to treat their wounds, they would not be in a hurry to take their lives.

"Master, what do you think the pirates want to do with us?" the long-term laborer Ma Peng asked him in a low voice. His injury was not worth mentioning. He had sprained his ankle while running away—he was pushing a cart to transport sandbags. As soon as the gunshots rang out, the person in front of him fell and he ran away. He didn't follow the team to charge in at all. If he hadn't been unlucky enough to injure his foot, he would probably be home by now.
