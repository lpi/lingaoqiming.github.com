Ziqi used to be a little uncomfortable with this kind of service, but now she was used to it. As a certain auntie Senator had said, "A personal secretary is just your father's concubine—not your mother. What's there to be polite about? If you don't enjoy your blessings, you'll be struck by lightning!"

"Hmm, I'll wash up now. It's a bit hot outside." Lin Ziqi sat down on the sofa in the living room. Meng Lan would naturally get her a change of clothes. At first, she was a little uncomfortable with another woman going through her underwear drawer, but after being served for a while, she didn't feel anything was wrong.

Meng Lan had already brought her a bottle of kvass that had been soaked in well water. The soaking time was just right, cool enough but not too cold—after all, it was only May. Besides her habit of not knocking, the maid training class was indeed extraordinary in its education!

The house was very quiet. Lin Fatian should be busy in some field or plantation and hadn't gotten off work yet. Lin Ziqi hadn't expected her father to get off work early today. After coming to Lingao, these men were all "full of passion," like characters from "The Passionate Years." Not only did they all wear that four-pocketed Zhongshan suit that was only seen in TV dramas, with a fountain pen clipped to their pockets, but they were also all "walking with the wind, speaking like a bell, shaking hands with a shake, and full of comrades." When they stood still, they all habitually put their hands on their hips, who knows where that habit came from...

Ziqi was once very uncomfortable with others calling her father "comrade," and it took her a while to get used to it.

Looking around, the house was clean and tidy, the furnishings were neat, and even the glass had just been wiped. The flowers on the table were freshly changed, and even the sofa cover looked like it had just been washed.

Compared to the messy dormitory she and her father used to live in, Meng Lan had brought a sense of home to the house. This was why Ziqi didn't object to her father having a personal secretary—a house really needed a mistress to feel like a home.

Meng Lan hurried to add firewood to the stove. She had already scrubbed the bathroom and bathtub with dilute hydrochloric acid early in the morning and rinsed them clean. Now, both the sanitary ware and the tiles were sparkling clean, and not a single hair could be seen. The Senators were all very particular about hygiene, and the young lady was even more so. As a result, she spent most of her energy on cleaning.

Besides this, Meng Lan was very satisfied with her current life. Just the living conditions—although the house was a bit small, the big grain-paying households in her hometown couldn't compare. Meng Lan had served the landlord's family with her parents when she was a child, so she had seen it. Not to mention anything else, just this floor, this glass window, the landlord's family didn't have them. As for food, it was a luxury she couldn't even dream of. In the village where she was born, the landlord's family ate miscellaneous grains every day.

Therefore, Meng Lan was dedicated to this family. To satisfy the chief and the young lady, so that such a life could continue forever, was her greatest hope.

Unfortunately, her belly was not cooperative, and she had not yet become pregnant... Every time she saw other personal secretaries holding their babies, she would feel very disappointed. The last time she went to Shop 43 to buy things, she heard a personal secretary named Sun say that a personal secretary without a child would always be unstable. One day, the chief would get tired of them and would definitely "send them away."

The health doctor from the General Office had also checked her pulse and prescribed medicine. She had also eaten a lot of nourishing medicine from Runshitang, but there was still no news. Thinking that the chief was almost fifty—her own father had passed away before he was fifty—if she couldn't give birth to a son or a daughter, what would she do in the second half of her life if something happened to her master? The young lady was good to her, but she couldn't possibly take her with her to her husband's family when she got married...

With these complicated emotions, Meng Lan finished adding firewood, washed her hands, and went to the young lady's room to get her underwear. The first time she wore such underwear in the training class, she had blushed—the chiefs were really lecherous. Now she knew that this was just ordinary clothes for the Australians, nothing special.

"Miss, you can take a bath now." After putting the clothes in the bathroom and preparing a large towel, Meng Lan checked the water temperature and felt it was about right, so she called out.

After helping Lin Ziqi into the bath, she quickly put the changed clothes into the laundry basket. The laundry would have to wait until the evening. She still had to hurry up and make dinner.

Because Ziqi was coming home today, tonight's dinner was much more sumptuous than usual. She had already ordered the ingredients she needed for today from the special supply store yesterday. The young lady's favorite was sashimi, which was particularly difficult to handle and required a cold chain throughout. Ordinary Senators rarely ate it at home because it was too troublesome. Meng Lan specially borrowed the Venus Type 0 from [Wu Nanhai][y009]'s house next door to pick up the goods from the special supply store. She carried a保温箱 (bǎowēnxiāng - insulated box) full of sawdust and ice and rushed back, finally putting it in her own "earthen refrigerator" in time.

Because his daughter was coming home today, Lin Fatian deliberately finished his work a little earlier and came back. As soon as he entered the door, he saw his daughter sitting at the dinner table waiting for him. In an instant, the fatigue of a day's work miraculously disappeared. While letting Meng Lan help him change his clothes and slippers, he asked, "How many days off do you have this time?"

The students of Fangcaodi rarely had holidays, and the learning institute was no exception.

"Two days. The school is having a cultural festival."

"What? Are you also going to perform?" After changing into his home clothes and washing his hands and face, he sat down next to his daughter. "Let daddy have a look..."

"What's there to see? I'm not your stump bonsai, to see where the binding is not right..." At this point, her face suddenly turned red, thinking of the night she and her best friend had discussed SM in the dormitory.

Lin Fatian didn't have such a rich imagination. "How can a stump bonsai be as beautiful as you?"

"Dad, you should really upgrade your outdated compliments," Lin Ziqi said, picking up a piece of sea bream sashimi, dipping it in wasabi and soy sauce, and putting it in her mouth.

Meng Lan brought over a large plate of golden and crispy fried chicken wings. Although they were not the same as the KFC chicken wings in her memory, they were quite similar. It was one of Lin Ziqi's favorite foods. Unfortunately, the school never served fried food, which was said to be Chen Sigen's suggestion.

Lin Ziqi let out a small cheer, eagerly grabbed a piece with her five golden dragon claws, and started chewing, mumbling, "Dad, you're off work early today."

"It's all for you."

"I didn't expect you to love me so much, Dad..."

"Eat your food," Lin Fatian had just finished speaking when Meng Lan brought over the rice. Lin Fatian went to bed early at night, so his staple food for dinner was miscellaneous grain porridge: a mixture of brown rice, millet, beans, and other miscellaneous grains cooked together, with a piece of sweet potato. Meng Lan had never understood why the chief preferred to eat this instead of white rice and flour.

"You sit down and eat," Lin Fatian said when he saw that Meng Lan didn't dare to sit down.

"There's still soup. I'll bring it over," Meng Lan said, about to go back to the kitchen.

"The chicken soup will be stewing for a while. You should eat first, Sister Lan," Lin Ziqi said, impatient with her "little wife"-like submissiveness.

Only after Lin Ziqi said this did Meng Lan sit down to eat.

"Dad, I want to go to Lingao Cape on Sunday."

"Are you going to play on the Feiyun?" Lin Fatian ate in large mouthfuls, and one chopstick-full could finish a third of the dish on the plate.

"Yes. With Zhang Yunmi and Qian Duoduo." Lin Ziqi was very cunning and didn't say that they were going for a trial run. If she had said that, her father would definitely have been worried to death and would have nagged about "not safe," "dangerous," and so on, trying every means to stop her.

"Alright. You can go. I don't have a holiday these two days either." Lin Fatian sighed as he spoke. Lin Ziqi felt that her father's gaze was a bit complicated.

In the blink of an eye, it had been six years since they had come to this world.

"Are you doing well in school?" her father asked again, a question with no nutritional value.

If they were in the 21st century, Lin Ziqi would probably be playing on her phone at this moment, mumbling, "It's okay."

At this moment, Lin Ziqi didn't have a smartphone, but her answer was about the same. "It's okay, but the academic pressure is too great."

"You have to study hard..."

Here we go again, so annoying. He said this every time they met, before and after transmigrating. Lin Ziqi said impatiently, "I'll still be a Senator even if I don't study well. Dad, you should hurry up and have a little brother or sister with Sister Lan to be your heir."

Lin Fatian actually blushed. "That's none of your business." As for Meng Lan, her face turned even redder.

"Our family has two seats. Wouldn't it be a big loss if you don't give me a little brother or sister?" Lin Ziqi successfully diverted the fire and continued to eat her fried chicken wings.

Lin Fatian nodded lightly. "Do you think having a little brother or sister is a good thing?"

"Why not? Otherwise, wouldn't one be wasted?"

"From that perspective, it's a good thing, of course. But ah—" Lin Fatian said, "Do you have a friend named Zhang Yunmi?"

"Yes, she's not only my classmate but also my roommate."

"Her father and I were drinking together last time. He said that he's been quite troubled since he had a son for Zhang Yunmi."

Zhang Yunmi's father and Lin Fatian were not colleagues, but since their daughters were classmates and best friends, they had become familiar with each other. Two single men who had transmigrated with their children naturally had some common ground and often drank and chatted together.

"What's the situation? Dad, tell me." Since it concerned her best friend, Lin Ziqi put down her chicken wings and became serious.

Meng Lan didn't know what Lin Fatian was going to say, but she instinctively realized that she shouldn't be listening. She quickly excused herself to check on the chicken soup on the stove and went back to the kitchen.

Lin Fatian sighed. "I don't know if I should say it or not. Old Zhang has been having a headache over this recently. You know he has a son..."

"I know that. Zhang Yunmi is very happy about it. She often says how cute her little brother is," Lin Ziqi asked in confusion.

"The problem is with this little brother," Lin Fatian's expression suddenly became serious.
