During a short break in the meeting, [Xiao Zishan][y001] went out and saw his women's army gathered in the break room, laughing and talking. Most of them had probably slipped out not long after the meeting started. There wasn't much to do here, so they could only chat. The younger ones ran over to him when they saw him, calling him "Group Leader," "Group Leader," as if they found it very amusing.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] gathered the women's army together: "The meeting inside is on a break. Let's have a small meeting for our General Affairs Group."

"Alright." "Go ahead, Group Leader, hahahaha." The wild energy of women gathered together was unleashed.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] sat there, waiting for their giggling fit to slowly pass—when their wild energy received no response from the men, they became much quieter.

"Our General Affairs Group, to put it bluntly, is in charge of logistics." He glanced at the girls in the General Affairs Group: there were eight of them in total. Except for the auntie in her fifties, they were basically all between twenty-three or four and thirty. Only one was in her early twenties, but she looked quite mainstream.

He had seen the personal registration forms they had filled out. Except for the auntie in her fifties who had put down "housewife," the other six had all been employed before. [Li Yuanyuan][y007] was a secretary, and the other five also had similar clerical jobs. The women with technical skills had all been assigned to other professional groups. Needless to say, the ones who ended up in the General Affairs Group were all girls with no special skills.

No wonder no one valued the position of head of the General Affairs Group. Wasn't this equivalent to a "remedial class"—or to put it more nicely, the "General Affairs Section 2"?

"Since we are in charge of logistics, we will definitely have to do a lot of trivial miscellaneous tasks. Let's start with the most basic problem of eating. The first thing for the General Affairs Group is to be responsible for the food supply."

"I've never cooked in my life, and I hate cooking the most." As expected, she was fierce. One brick was enough to stun an inexperienced man.

"Me neither," a girl said timidly, "but I can learn."

"I don't mind cooking, as long as you dare to eat it! Hahaha." This one put on a posture of "if you're not afraid to die, then let this granny cook."

"I can cook for everyone. Rice, flatbread, noodles, all are fine. But for so many people, we need big pots. I've never worked in a canteen before, so I don't know if I can do it." [Auntie Cao][y110] spread her hands, a little hesitant.

[Xiao Zishan][y001] knew that [Auntie Cao][y110]'s full name was [Cao Shunhua][y110]. She had gone down to the countryside after graduating from junior high school and returned to the city very late. Except for working as a temporary worker in a neighborhood collective enterprise for a few years, she had basically been a housewife for her entire life. Her husband had passed away very early, and her daughter, who worked in construction, had recently divorced. Her life had been full of hardships, and she was a simple and resilient person. To use an old saying, she was a woman who "possessed the traditional virtues of Chinese working women."

"Let's just order boxed lunches," a slightly older woman suggested. "There are so many people, and there will be more in the future. It won't be enough even if we all cook."

"The quality of boxed lunches is not good, everyone knows that." [Xiao Zishan][y001] shook his head with a smile. "It's fine to make do with it for lunch or something, but we're going to be here for half a year to a year. Are we going to eat boxed lunches every day?!" He took a breath and said with an enticing smile, "Doesn't everyone also hope that their boyfriends and families eat well?"

If it were another place, this line of reasoning would be like playing a lute to a cow. But this place was different. These women were willing to go to another time and space for the sake of their relationships. The importance they placed on their men should be much higher than that of ordinary couples.

As for why he went to the trouble of insisting on running a canteen, it was mainly to accumulate experience for the food supply after the transmigration. There were no fast-food companies in 17th-century Hainan.

The women looked at each other and said nothing.

"Zhao Xiaoqin, you used to be a purchaser in a catering company, right?"

"Yes, five years of purchasing experience." This woman, nearly thirty, let out a long sigh.

"Then you can be in charge of purchasing," [Xiao Zishan][y001] proposed. "Dealing directly with suppliers, you are definitely a professional in this area."

Zhao Xiaoqin hesitated for a moment: "I'm not familiar with the suppliers here."

"It doesn't matter. Since it's your profession, changing to a new place should be a piece of cake for a professional like you." [Xiao Zishan][y001] knew that to encourage someone to work, besides economic incentives, the most effective way was to affirm their value as a professional.

"Alright then, I'll give it a try. But I have a request."

"Go ahead."

"I need an office. I have my own computer, but I need a phone line, and oh, a fax machine. If possible, it would be best to have internet access."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] quickly jotted down her requests in his notebook.

"The internet is a bit of a problem, we haven't applied for it yet. The phone and office are no problem. I will solve them for you one by one."

"I need you to draw up a menu... a meal plan, so that I can estimate the purchase volume." She seemed to be pondering something as she muttered to herself, "Vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs..."

Good, this was starting to feel like a work atmosphere. This was what he wanted.

"Sister Xiaoqin, we don't need to buy all that, do we? We can order pre-prepped vegetables."

Right, pre-prepped vegetables. [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought, *that was my plan too*. The fact that someone brought it up showed that everyone was quite smart. The advantage of pre-prepped vegetables was that they didn't require much processing and could be cooked directly into dishes, saving the tedious procedures of sorting, washing, and processing. This was perfect for modern people who were fond of leisure and averse to labor.

If they really bought a pile of chickens, ducks, fish, meat, and vegetables like a regular company canteen, just preparing the raw materials would cause great conflict among this group of women.

"Oh, right, that's convenient." Zhao Xiaoqin also smiled. "Otherwise, picking and washing vegetables would be a troublesome task." The decadent look on her face disappeared. "In that case, I'll go to the city in a few days, get some product catalogs from the pre-prepped vegetable companies, and also check the market prices. When I come back, I can calculate the standard for each person."

"Alright." [Xiao Zishan][y001] was secretly pleased.

"Then I need one more person to help me, is that okay?" Zhao Xiaoqin hesitated for a moment. "It's not quite appropriate for me to handle it all by myself."

She was indeed a veteran of the workplace, knowing when to advance and when to retreat. Since she was so tactful, [Xiao Zishan][y001] also had to show his full respect for her:

"You choose one."

"I'll help you." The little girl who had just suggested pre-prepped vegetables volunteered. "I can speak Cantonese."

"Alright, you help me. But Group Leader, what about our funding and reimbursement process?"

[Xiao Zishan][y001] explained the whole process. During the year-long preparation period, it was very necessary to establish a simple but complete administrative and financial system, and it would serve as an important reference in the future.

"Then I understand. Everything is cash on delivery, right?"

"Right." This was to avoid too much contact with the suppliers. If it was just delivery, they could just unload at the gate and be done with it.

"Big Sister Cao, the leadership of this kitchen army is up to you." [Xiao Zishan][y001] said with a tone of utmost sincerity. "To be honest, we young people are not very good at cooking. Running a canteen has to satisfy everyone. Your skills are quite good, so I'll entrust this aspect to you."

"Look at you, Xiao... Group Leader..." She was probably not used to the title of Group Leader.

"You can just call me [Zishan][y001]."

"Then I'll call you [Zishan][y001]," Auntie Cao smiled happily. "Cooking is not that difficult. You'll know after watching a few times. It's just that my skills are all northern style. I don't know if the comrades from the south are used to it. I heard you have to add sugar when you cook?"

"I don't think it will be a problem," [Xiao Zishan][y001] smiled. "Everyone's tastes are not so particular now. We are purchasing pre-prepped vegetables with popular flavors, so they are easy to cook. You can just provide some variety for everyone, make some staple foods and so on."

"Alright! I'm good at that."

"Zhao Xiaoqin, we also need to add some kitchen equipment. You know a little about this, so go and take a look."

She made a note in her small notebook, "What is the maximum number of people we need to supply for?"

"Five to six hundred, I guess." [Xiao Zishan][y001] seemed a little troubled. "Let's try to be economical when buying the equipment. Many things, like rice cookers and so on, I'm afraid we won't be able to use them when we get there."

"Oh, that's okay," she said. "Kitchen equipment can be rented. For now, let's just rent everything and not buy."

[Xiao Zishan][y001] nodded. As expected, being a professional in one's field was the most powerful. In a group, one must make the best use of everyone's talents.

He arranged all the work related to the canteen. In addition to their own duties, the General Affairs Group had to help in the canteen every day. In addition, the other transmigrators would take turns helping in the kitchen in groups of four. The General Affairs Group, because of their dedicated contribution to logistics services, would have a separate dinner party once a week, and could bring their boyfriends or family members, with a standard of 20 yuan per person.

This little extra benefit made everyone quite satisfied.

"[Li Yuanyuan][y007]."

"Here! Group Leader." The girl stood at attention.

"You will also be responsible for all the clerical work, including personnel materials, meeting minutes organization, reports and applications from various groups, financial statements, and so on. All of these must be compiled into volumes and preserved as archives, understand?"

"Understood! Group Leader."

"Fang Yijing, you are responsible for the distribution of various daily necessities, as well as dormitory management and the allocation of sanitation duties."

"Me?" The woman whose name was called was taken aback.

"Weren't you a nursery teacher before?"

"That was for little children. There are many men here—"

"It's okay, hehe. With women around, they will pay more attention to their image and won't be too sloppy."

In the short half-hour break, [Xiao Zishan][y001] had basically established all the links of the General Affairs Group. Procurement: Zhao Xiaoqin; Canteen: [Tian Shunhua][y110]; Dormitories: Fang Yijing; Secretariat: [Li Yuanyuan][y007]. Each person was assigned an assistant. [Xiao Zishan][y001] thought, this way, after the transmigration, there would be a system to follow for organizing logistics.
